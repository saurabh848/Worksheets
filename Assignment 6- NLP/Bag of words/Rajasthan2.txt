The BJP’s bid to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot government on the floor of the Rajasthan assembly fell flat with the sudden reunion of Congress MLA Sachin Pilot and party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gadhi Vadra Monday, four days before the House session on 14 August.

The BJP’s strategy, party sources said, failed because of several reasons, including former CM Vasundhara Raje’s “non-cooperation” with the high command in toppling the Congress government, BJP’s own divided house in the state and Union Minister Gajendra Shekhawat’s little influence over Gehlot camp MLAs.


Pilot’s inability to secure support of more than 22 MLAs, and the way Gehlot guarded his own MLAs also left no window for the BJP to turn around the Rajasthan crisis in its favour, the way it did in Madhya Pradesh, sources added.

In the end, Gehlot and Raje emerged as the real Chanakyas of Rajasthan in this intense power struggle, they added.

Leader of the Opposition in Rajasthan assembly Gulab Chand Kataria told ThePrint the crisis was initiated due to Pilot’s rebellion against Gehlot government and it was the internal matter of the Congress.
