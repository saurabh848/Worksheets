Ministry allows airlines to set ‘baggage limit’,"  The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has amended provisions regarding baggage limit on domestic flights, giving airline carriers the freedom to decide on it as per their internal policy. Ahead of this, passengers flying domestic routes were only allowed to take one hand baggage and one check-in luggage. Issuing a new memorandum, the MoCA said, “Baggage limitation would be as per the airlines’ policies.” “The matter with regard to check-in baggage has been reviewed based on the feedback/inputs received from the concerned stakeholders,” the ministry noted. Following the notice, airlines will be able to reset the domestic check-in baggage limit back to 15 kg as it will help them slightly increase their revenues. When the domestic passenger flights resumed on May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic, the ministry had stated that only one check-in baggage and one hand baggage per passenger must be allowed.  Passengers were also allowed to carry check-in baggage up to 20 kg without any additional charge. Currently, airlines are permitted to operate not more than 60 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.

SAARC must defeat terrorism: Jaishankar,"  Listing cross-border terrorism as one of the main challenges, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has to overcome it to ensure everlasting peace in the region. The other hurdles are blocking connectivity and obstructing trade, he said. The Minister made these observations in an obvious reference to Pakistan while addressing an informal virtual meeting of foreign ministers of the eight-member grouping.  It was not functioning for some time now because of differences between India and Pakistan. The meeting of the foreign ministers is an annual event held on the margins of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. These meetings have often seen sharp exchanges between the two nations in recent years. “Cross-border terrorism, blocking connectivity and obstructing trade are three key challenges that SAARC must overcome,” Jaishankar said in a string of tweets highlighting the contents of his speech. “Only then will we see enduring peace, prosperity and security in our South Asia region,” he added. The Minister said, “Over the last 35 years, Saarc has made significant progress. But our efforts towards collective collaboration and prosperity have been hampered by acts of terrorism and threats to national security. “Such an environment impedes our shared objective of realising the full potential of our collective endeavour. It is, therefore, crucial that we collectively resolve to defeat the scourge of terrorism, including the forces that nurture, support and encourage it. This will generate the much needed trust and confidence to collectively build a stronger and prosperous Saarc.” India holds Pakistan responsible for cross-border terror in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). Jaishankar said he had also reaffirmed India’s commitment to its “neighbourhood first” policy and towards building a connected, integrated, secure and prosperous South Asia. He also highlighted India’s Covid-19-related cooperation efforts, including a commitment of $10 million to the emergency fund for the region, the supply of essential drugs, medical consumables, and protection and test kits to the region, and a video conference of health professionals from the region to share information and best practices on the pandemic. India had also launched a Covid-19 Information Exchange Platform (COINEX) to facilitate exchange of specialised information, helped the development of an innovative website by the Saarc Disaster Management Centre to provide reliable information and updates on the evolving situation, and activated the Saarc Food Bank mechanism to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, he said. In his address, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi spoke of his country’s “willingness to host the 19th SAARC Summit and for obstacles created in its way to be removed for SAARC to function as an effective instrument of regional cooperation”. The summit was scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November 2016 but was called off after an attack on an Indian Army camp at Uri in Kashmir that was blamed on Pakistan-based terrorists. Since then, SAARC has largely been dormant.  ",india

AMU reservation issue raised in Parliament again,"  Once again MP Satish Kumar Gautam raised the reservation issue of AMU during Zero Hour in Parliament. The MP said that there is no reservation of SC, ST and backward class students in AMU like it is in Kashi Hindu University due to which these students are not getting a chance to study in good university. This is the violation of their rights. The system should be implemented in the AMU as well and demanded to form a monitoring committee.

Madras High Court quashes Palani Temple's move to appoint contractors,"  The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday delivered a verdict with respect to the holy shrine of Lord Muruga at Palani Hills in Tamil Nadu by cancelling the tender issued by the executive officer to appoint contractors for providing house keeping services in the temple and establishments attached to the temple. Justice G R Swaminathan, who heard a writ petition filed by T R Ramesh, president, Indic Collective, challenging the executive officer’s move to float tenders  for the same accepted the contention of the petitioner that devotees were authorized with the maintenance and cleaning of the  the   temple and its premises as per “Uzhavara Pani”, an age old voluntary service ritual. Ramesh also argued that the executive officer by entrusting the cleaning and maintenance works of the temple to outsiders on a commercial basis was infringing on the rights of the devotees.                  He pointed out that the Board of Trustees which should consist of eminent Hindus and men of impeccable characters have been lying vacant for the last nine years as the Government has filed to reconstitute the same after the expiry of the previous Trustee’s tenure. Justice Swaminathan who heard both sides felt that devotees should not be denied their rights to offer voluntary services.. “The State Government as well as the controlling authorities will take all possible steps to ensure that the board of trustees is constituted for the second respondent temple as early as possible. Reconstituting temple trust boards with eminent Hindus and men of impeccable character would be a good start. Leaving the temples in the care of the bureaucracy and politicians hasn’t helped,” said Swaminathan in his verdict. Quoting from Periya Puranam (Great Epic) authored by Sekkizhar, the 12th century saint, the justice pointed out that Shaivism speaks of four modes of worship-sariyai, kriyai, yogam and gnanam. “Sariyai includes physical service (Uzhavara Pani). House keeping contract  is the commercial counterpart of Uzhavara Pani,” ruled the judge. “This is magnificent judgment from the Madras HC which lays the foundation for getting all Hindu temples freed from bureaucratic and political control,” said Subramanian Swamy MP.

Duty bound to take disciplinary action against rowdy MPs: Naidu,"  Even as the Opposition continued to boycott Parliament, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said he was duty bound to take disciplinary action against the eight MPs although their suspension was an “unpleasant” thing to do.  Justifying his action, he also said the opposition has the right to protest but the question is how it should be done. Addressing the house before adjourning the house sine die, Naidu also appreciated the role of Parliament staff and said holding a session during this pandemic required some innovative thinking and elaborate planning, well in advance. Secretary-General, Rajya Sabha and his team in the Secretariat as also the Parliament Security Service and other agencies including the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) who worked behind the scenes, “did not fail me in this regard. I would like to put on record my appreciation for the efforts made by them.”  The Members present in the House lauded the contribution by thumping the desk. As regards the events in the last three days, Naidu said he was duty bound to uphold the dignity of the rules, standards and values of the Upper House.  He also said the Rules do provide for such suspension when it becomes inevitable. In his concluding remarks before the Rajya Sabha was adjourned eight days ahead of the schedule, the Chairman said the floor of the august House was the most effective platform for contestation of ideas. However, if boycott is done for a longer period, it amounts to leaving the very platform that enables members to effectively convey their ideas, besides contesting those of others. Referring to the letter he had received from Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and others urging the House not to pass the three labour codes, the Chairman said there have been a number of precedents when the business was taken up as per schedule and bills were approved in the wake of boycott or walkout by some members. In this context, he cited the passage of the Finance Bill and Appropriation Bill in 2013. Naidu said had the letter suggested the postponement of bill by stating that they would attend the House, he would have discussed the issue with the government. He said there was no such assurance. On the other hand some of the members justified what they had done. Therefore, he decided to go ahead with the bills, he said. The Chairman said for the first time in this history of this House, a notice of motion was given for the removal of the Deputy Chairman and it was rejected. He pointed out that the mandatory 14 days advance notice was not given. Referring to the developments surrounding this unprecedented move, he said they have been deeply painful for all those who hold the stature and the dignity of this House dear to their hearts. He appealed to the members to ensure that such unseemly behaviour was not repeated. Though it was not the first time that some members were suspended and Bills passed when some sections of the House boycotted the proceedings, Naidu said “I find it extremely unpalatable. This kind of a situation needs to be avoided by all means.”    ",india

Fake news used to label encounter staged: Then Spl Cell chief,"  Fake news and ""street rumours"" were picked up by a section of politicians, activists and media to paint the 2008 Batla House encounter of IM terrorists as staged, retired IPS officer and the then chief of the Delhi Police special cell Karnal Singh has said. The 1984-batch officer of the Union Territories cadre has come out with a book — Batla House: An Encounter that Shook the Nation — on the police operation on September 19, 2008 at house number L-18 in the Batla House locality of Jamia Nagar in south Delhi. The book has been published by Rupa Publications. The officer was spearheading a probe into the 2008 Delhi blasts as the head or joint commissioner of police of the elite special cell that was raised specifically to undertake counterterrorist operations. Leads from the blast probe led the special cell to Batla House where Indian Mujahideen terrorists were holed-up. A gunbattle broke between the policemen, who went for a reconnaissance, and the terrorists in which special cell Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma lost his life, while two terrorists were eliminated. Singh, who retired in 2018 as the Director of the Enforcement Directorate, spoke to PTI on the operation, seen as one of the most politicised police encounters of the country.     ""There was a perception built around the Batla House encounter by disseminating fake news,” Singh said.  “Many politicians, activists and media houses picked up street rumours without any fact-checking."" ""For example, some alleged that Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma died due to three bullets fired at his back by his teammates and they also alleged that the terrorist did not fire at all. The post-mortem report clearly stated that Mohan had got two bullet injuries from front and not back,"" he said. Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences conducted the post-mortem of the two terrorists also and collected their hand wash and sent it to the forensic science laboratory for dermal nitrate test to conclude if they had fired or not, Singh said. ""The test for the terrorists came out to be positive indicating clearly that both the terrorists had fired on the police team,"" he said. ""Fake news circulation did create an obstacle but only for a short while. All the facts, evidences and investigations proved the authenticity of the encounter."" ""This case has been through multiple scrutiny from diverse and independent agencies and the truth has stood strong through the test of time, patience and adverse perceptions. Our turning point was when a few people who had earlier believed in fake news were open to factual accounts,"" the officer said, replying to a question on the upheavals they faced after the encounter.

"UP: Ahead of panchayat polls, demand for illegal guns surges","  With Uttar Pradesh Panchayat elections including Aligarh in the upcoming months , the demand for illegal weapons has also soared to influence voters and intimidate rivals and to score a victory at any cost. In the elections for Pradhan, violence, power and money are the backbone of most of the candidates which often turns the election into the battlefields. This resulted in rivalry affects generations of family’s candidate. On the other hand, these elections are an evergreen market of illegal firearms and liquor which has received fresh input during this election in Aligarh. These weapons are being sold at elevated prices to the criminals in Aligarh division. Aligarh, Etah, Mainpuri and Bulandshaher are the biggest market of illegal arms in western U.P with Aligarh as the main manufacturing hub of these illegal firearms because it is an industrial epicenter of lock and hardware industries due to which cheap labor, technique and materials are readily and easily available. Most of the country made arms also manufactured by blacksmith here in Aligarh. These weapons are being used by villagers and farmers to protect them from criminals and wild animals but during elections, these arms are used to intimidate voters and maintain their supremacy. Another reason for this illegal business is that during elections, the district authorities have asked licensed holders to surrender their arms to the police which in turn creates fear among the people to their lives hence they eventually purchased illegal arms even at an elevated cost to save their lives. According to the sources, during panchayat elections, Aligarh based illegal arms manufacturers received an order of thousands of small arms including revolver, kattas, pistol and guns by the brokers of the political arm mafia. Because of this huge demand during Panchayat elections, the cost of such items increased by 150 to 200%. Sources said that katta which is usually available at Rs 4000 now costs upto Rs 8000, five round revolvers available for Rs 8000 now cost Rs 14000 and country-made pistol available for Rs 8000 now sell at a price of Rs 13000. Middleman play an important role in this market as the manufacturer cannot approach directly to the customer or vice versa to avoid scandals. Sources further added that currently, around ten mafias are active in this business who are busy in contacting the prospective candidates of Pradhan and other posts for the supply of weapons.

Protest against Kerala’s bias against Tata’s Covid Hospital,"  Citizens in Kasaragod district in Kerala are up in arms against the State Government for its indifference to the Exclusive Covid Hospital built by the Tata Group as part of their commitment to the people. “The 541-bedded hospital was built at a cost of Rs 60 crore by the Tatas in just 150 days. The Tatas handed over the fully furnished hospital building to the Kerala Government on September 9. But till date the State administration has not appointed even a single doctor or para-medic staff to the hospital though the district is seeking a surge in the number of Covid-19 patients,” Sukumaran Periyachoor, Kerala State Secretary of Saparya Cultural Society, said in a release on Wednesday.

Hospitals getting oxygen cylinders from unlicensed dealers,"  In the corona period, oxygen gas cylinders are playing important role in saving the lives of patients. Most of the hospitals are getting the oxygen cylinder from unlicensed dealers. According to the business sources, dealers are supplying oxygen gases which are basically used in welding to various hospitals in the district. This welding oxygen gas can be dangerous for the patients as it contains many harmful substances. In this regard, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has already ordered to be vigilant, yet the supply is continuing without any testing. The main reason is that the industrial oxygen cylinder is much cheaper than medical oxygen. The purity of medical oxygen must be 99% but the industrial oxygen contains carbon dioxide and other heavy hydrocarbons which can be harmful to the patients.  Social worker Kapil Varshney said that in the name of gas cylinders, the black marketing that is going on in the city should be investigated and stopped. Some businessmen are playing with the lives of people. The game of over renting should also be stopped. Drug inspector Hemendra Chaudhary said that there are five medical oxygen plants in the district, they are also making commercial oxygen cylinder. Gas standards are checked and monitored at the plant itself. We took in writing from these plants that they all will give priorities to medical supplies first. How do they do it To make industrial cylinders like medical oxygen cylinders, they make the white color on the top and the black stripe on the bottom. Per day charge of oxygen in the intensive care unit is from Rs 500 to Rs 1500 Industrial cylinders should not be available in the market, it should be supplied from the air plant, but it is available in the market Structure of oxygen cylinder Oxygen cylinders should not be exposed to sunlight during transportation and storage. Should not be mixed with flammable gas cylinders when used Responsibility of daily wages workers of air plant As a rule, trained workers should be employed in an air plant or refilling. Those who deliver in hospitals and industries should also have the technical knowledge, but this is not happening. From refilling to hospital delivery, they are not aware of the pressure capacity of the cylinder and how much pressure the cylinder has. The hospital operators received the cylinders after checking the pressure through the pressure gauge. These are some gases Nitrogen gas is used in ACs and other machines. Nitrous gas acts as a lifesaving agent to emerge from the unconsciousness. Argon gas is used in welding. Carbon dioxide gas is used by cold drinking companies.  ",india
Aligarh: Oxygen on sale without proper inspection,"  Oxygen gas was being sold by Kasimpur road located Radha Industrial Gas Plant without any proper testing, license, and registration. On Monday night, the plant was sealed after a night-long investigation by the team led by the City Magistrate. They also cease the company’s bill book and receipts. Supply records are being scrutinized for the last two-month deliveries. District Magistrate was directed to register a case against plant owner Arun Agarwal and has sought a response from the drug inspector. The administrative team already confiscated all the documents along with 300 cylinders and 4 vehicles last night. The team has questioned plant owner Arun Agarwal in which it was revealed that this plant has been supplying gas in Aligarh, Hathras, Kasgunj and Etah since 24th August. On 7 September, the plant owner applied for a license in the Control of Explosives office, Agra. After this raid, there is chaos within the departments for persecution. District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh gave a strict warning to the drug inspector for the action. City Magistrate and ACM II team has been instructed to do this activity continuously. In May 2015, there was a huge explosion in Kasimpur Powerhouse, in which half a dozen people were killed. Experts said that this accident was caused by the explosion of oxygen cylinders, which was supplied by this plant. At that time, this plant was used to prepare liquid oxygen. The administration did not renew the license after the explosion. District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh said that black marketing of the oxygen cylinder will not be tolerated. The team has been continuously instructed to act proactively. Further action will be taken on the report regarding the fake plant. Oxygen gas godown closed due to fear of action. Godown and shops of oxygen gas used in medical and industries remained closed on Tuesday due to the fear of administrative action however these Godowns and shops were open even on the day of lockdown last week. Since 24th August, oxygen cylinders used throughout the district were being black-marketed and the justification of the plant operators was that they are not getting liquid hence refilling is not possible. Brass idol makers and gas welding workers have accused plant operators of black marketing by showing a lack of oxygen. Rs 350 cylinders are selling for Rs 1200. Jitendra Pandit, president of the Gas Association, said that since a week the plant owners have been giving justification of shortage of liquid, hence the warehouses and shops have been closed.

Rhea’s judicial custody extended till Oct 6,"  A Special court here on Tuesday extended the judicial custody of actress Rhea Chakraborty in the Sushant Singh Rajput-related drug case till October 6, even as the Narcotic Control Bureau (NCB) widened its scope of investigations and summoned Deepika Padukone’s manager Karishma Prakash and talent management agency’s CEO Dhruv Chitgopekar for questioning in a WhatsApp chat involving “Padmavat” actress. In a related development, the Bombay High Court will hear the bail pleas of Rhea – who had been arrested on September 8 in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput-related drug case – and her brother Showik –who had been arrested in the same case earlier, on Wednesday. The special court – dealing with cases registered under the the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 – had earlier on September 11 rejected the bail pleas of Rhea, her brother Showik and four others in connection with a much-discussed drug case relating to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. On Tuesday when the NCB questioned Sushant’s talent manager Jaya Saha for the second consecutive day, the spotlight remained riveted on the summons issued to Deepika Padukone’s manager Karishma Prakash and talent management agency’s CEO Dhruv Chitgopekar on the basis of the “Padmavat” actress’ whatsApp charts with her manager Karishma retrieved by the NCB. Karishma works with Jaya Saha, with whom Rhea Chakraborty had chatted about CBD oil, as a manager in Kwan talent management agency. During the questioning, the NCB reportedly quizzed Jaya if she had any knowledge about Karishma procuring drugs for Deepika Padukone. According to sources, the NCB investigations have thrown up a whatsApp chat of 2017 between D (Deepika Padukone) and K (Karishma). In the chat, Deepika reportedly asks Karishna: “you have Maal?, Karishma responds saying: “Yes, but at home. I am at Bandra. Later Krishma tells Deepika that one Amit is bringing it to a high-end restaurant “koko” at Lower Parel. Deepika seeks to confirm if it is hash not weed. After being summoned for questioning, Karishna did not turn up at the NCB office for questioning, saying that she needed some more time, while her talent management agency’s CEO Dhruv Chitgopekar offered to co=operate with the agency in the investigations. Despite the fact that the electronic media went to the town over Deepeika’s name figuring in the drug probe and claimed that she herself was being summoned for questioning, there was no official word from “Padmavat” actress who is reportedly away in Goa shooting for a film. Similarly, there was no official word from the NCB that Deepika was being summoned for questioning in the coming days. On its part, the NCB has confirmed that it would question Bollywood actresses Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh Singh and fashion designer Simone Khambatta on the basis of Rhea’s statement recorded by the NCB. The three were among others who used to have drug parties at Sushant’s farm house at Lonavla near Pune.  Rhea had reportedly told the investigators. Meanwhile, soon after a section of the media said that her name had figured in the drug probe, yesteryear actress   Diya Mirza came down with a vehement denial.  “I would like to strongly refute and categorically deny this news as being false, baseless and with mala fide intentions. I have never procured or consumed any narcotic or contraband substances of any form in my life. I intend to pursue the full extent of legal remedies available to me as a law abiding citizen of India. Thanks to my supporters for standing by me,” Diya said. Meanwhile, Rhea – whose bail plea is coming up for hearing before the Bombay High Court on Wednesday -- has contended that she was innocent and falsely implicated in the Sushant death-related drug case. Rhea has been booked under Section 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import); 20(b)(ii) (punishment for contravention in relation to the cannabis plant and cannabis where such contravention relates to small quantity, involves quantity lesser than commercial quantity but greater than small quantity, involves commercial quantity); 22 (punishment for contravention in relation to psychotropic substances); 27A (punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders); 28 (punishment for attempts to commit offences); and 29 (punishment for abetment and criminal conspiracy) of the NDPS act. A HC bench of Justice Sarang V Kotwal will hear the bail pleas of Rhea and Showik filed through their senior counsel Satish Maneshinde and advocate Anandini Fernandes, on Wednesday. In one of the several grounds that he had cited for grant of bail to his client Rhea, Maneshinde had stated in the bail application filed before the court: “The application has been arraigned for an offence punishable under section 8 (c) read with 20 (b) (ii) 22, 27 A, 28, 29 and 30 of the NDPS Act, 1985. Given that no drug and psychotropic substances have been seized from the applicant and the allegations. If any, would pertain strictly to small quantities, and given that though section 27 A has been applied, the ingredients have thereof not been made out, the bar under section 37 (1) of the NDPS would not apply in the present circumstances. Thus the offence, if any, is bailable in nature the Applicant ought to be enlarged on bail”. The other ground that Maneshinde cited for the release of Rhea and Showik on bail is the “ground of parity” since three other accused arrested in connection with the same have been released on bail. He also told the court that the section 27 (A) of NDPS Act, 1985 pertaining to financing illicit traffic of drugs had been applied only in the case of Rhea and Showik although “no seizures have been made from the two”. However, the Mumbai Sessions court did not accept the grounds cited by Maneshinde for granting bail to Rhea. Rhea and Showik are among the ten accused arrested in connection with the drug case related to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The other arrested accused are:  Abbas Lakhani, Karan Arora, Zaid Vilatra, Abdel Basit Parihar, Anuj Keswani, Kaizan Ibrahim, Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant.    ",india
Never seen Bills passed in such hurry: Pawar,"  As he went on a day-long fast to express his solidarity with the eight suspended Rajya sabha members, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday debunked the hurried manner in which the BJP-led government had agriculture reform bills passed in the upper house of Parliament without discussion and vote. Talking to media persons here, Pawar said: “I have never seen bills being passed like this. They (the BJP-led NDA government) wanted to pass these bills soon. Members had questions regarding the bill and they wanted a discussion,” Generally, the members are allowed to speak, deliberate and oppose the bills.  I didn’t understand the haste in this particular matter,” he said, adding the basic concern was about mentioning the protection of minimum support price (MSP) in the bills. “Now the government has clarified that such a protection mechanism is there,” Pawar said. Denying reports that his party supported the BJP by walking out of the house when the bills were put to voice votes, Pawar said: “The information isn’t true. Our members protested and walked out when the Deputy Chairman rushed through the bills. In the Lok Sabha, (NCP MP) Supriya Sule has spoken against the bills. In fact, my assessment of the Deputy Chairman, who is a disciple of (a great socialist leader) Karpuri Thakur, is proved wrong today. His conduct was unprecedented. I haven’t seen such a thing in my 50-year Parliamentary career. That’s why I have observed a fast today to support the MPs”. On Shiv Sena’s on the bills passed in Rajya Sabha, Pawar asked: “But haven’t they opposed it in the Rajya Sabha?” The NCP chief said his party would formally announce its support to the nation-wide agitation by several parties and farmers’ organisations.

Aligarh: Traders on indefinite strike to protest against mandi tax,"  Mandi traders have started an indefinite strike to protest the tax exemption on the purchase of food grains outside the mandi premises and against the 2% mandi duty and 0.5% cess within the mandi. Dhanipur Mandi based agents have declared that their strike will continue till the government does not withdraw this rule law. In this regard, they also submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Director mandi addressed to the Chief Minister. Due to this strike, the work was stalled in the grain mandis across the district and the business of about 80 lakh rupees was affected. Suresh Chandra Lodhi, chairman of Galla Traders Welfare Committee, said that on one hand, the government has given exemption of mandi duty and cess on the sale of grain outside the mandi premises but within the mandi, 2% mandi duty and 0.5% cess tax has been imposed. This is causing a loss of revenue for the government itself. Farmers are not coming inside the market which results in the crisis of livelihood of hundreds of Mandi workers. Big companies are buying floor and pulse food grains from outside. Farmers are also being exploited by this by not getting the right price of their produce. The company is paying the arbitrary price of produce to the farmers. The galla traders will not open the mandi till the government does not take back their decision. Mukut Bihari, Dinesh Singh, Rajkumar, Dev Kumar, etc are involved in the strike.  ",india
"Vijayan blames Opp, media for spike in Covid-19 cases","   Even as the Department of Health in Kerala diagnosed 4,125 new patients with Covid-19 on Tuesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan blamed the Opposition parties and the media in the State for the ‘unprecedented hike’ in the transmission of the disease. “My Government has done the best to control and regulate the Covid-19 pandemic. But the Opposition parties in the State want to subvert and sabotage the good works of my government. The media is highlighting the unnecessary and unwanted agitations and demonstrations staged by the opposition parties,” Vijayan charged while briefing the media on Tuesday evening. He said though he was not against rightful agitations, the present demonstrations have been planned by the Opposition parties with the sole aim of spreading the pandemic.   “There are 40, 382 active patients in the State. Out of the 4,125 new patients diagnosed on Tuesday, 3,463 contracted the disease through social transmission. The day also saw 19 persons succumbing to the disease and this has taken the fatalities till date to 553. Its only because of the Opposition agitation and unlawful crowds mobilized by them the pandemic went out of control in Kerala,” said Vijayan.                The BJP and its feeder organizations like ABVP, BJYM and Mahila Morchcha are on a statewide agitation demanding the resignation of higher education minister K T Jaleel whose name is linked to gold smuggling and illegal import of Quran allegedly for smuggling in gold from UAE. The Chief Minister said that the Opposition parties are making life dangerous for the common people. “It is not that the opposition parties are ignorant of the World Health Organization guidelines. They think that it is only through violent demonstrations that they get noticed  by the people. The media should understand the intentions of these parties,” said Vijayan.    He was all praise for policemen in the State whom  he described as the guardians of the society. “The day saw 101 policemen were diagnosed on Tuesday with Covid-19. These are all part of the conspiracies hatched by the opposition,” he said.  ",india
Assembly brawl case: Court junks Kerala Govt’s move to withdraw criminal case against accused,"  Kerala government faced an embarrassment on Tuesday as R Jayakrishnan, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, rejected its  request for withdrawing the criminal complaint registered against six members of the legislative Assembly by Crime Branch for the brawl  and indecent behavior inside the House on March 13, 2015. The Crime Branch case was that the MLAs who had tried to stop the then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget damaged public property worth more than Rs 2 lakh . This included computer terminals, mikes, chairs and other furniture. Two ministers of the present government, E P Jayarajan and K T Jaleel figure among the six accused in the case. Government’s decision to seek withdrawal of the   case was to ‘preserve the unity of the House’, the deputy director of prosecution had told the court. The CJM made it clear that the request to withdraw the complaint at this juncture was like insulting and humiliating the people of Kerala who were watching the live proceedings of the House. The CPI(M) had unleashed an agitation against Mani, who allegedly took an amount of Rs 1 crore from bar owners for re-opening the bars which were shut down in the State as part of ushering in total prohibition.  The opposition wanted Mani, an accused in the corruption case not to present the State’s 2015-2016 budget. When Mani walked into the House to present the budget, the entire Opposition MLAs charged against him, entered into the Speaker’s Podium, pulled down the chair and computer terminals and destroyed the mike. The  pandemonium and free for all were shown live by the  TV channels. There were name calling and physical assaults by the opposition members similar to the scenes the Rajya Sabha witnessed last Sunday. There was a change of government in the 2016 election and the CPI(M) came close to the Mani Group of the Kerala Congress. Sivankutty, one of the accused in the case who is also the son-in-law of party ideologist late P Govinda Pillai, submitted an application to Pinarayi Vijayan who had forwarded the same to the court.   The opposition of the present assembly too had filed a petition in the court against withdrawing the case. Ramesh Chennithala, leader of the opposition said that he would not rest till the accused in the case were punished.  ",india

TMC hits streets against farm Bills,"  Quick to milk a farmer centric issue that once catapulted it to power post Singur and Nandigram movements the Trinamool Congress on Tuesday lapped up the alleged forced passage of farm bill in Rajya Sabha even as the party launched pan-Bengal demonstrations demanding an immediate rollback of the “black law.” Cleverly mixing the farm bill with the amendment in essential commodities laws that has declassified a plethora of eatables including potato, onion --- which are already selling for a premium in the State --- edible oil and other items raising apprehensions of burning bigger holes in consumers’ pockets, the TMC leadership said the party would reach door-to-door driving home the “side effects of the BJP Government’s pro-rich reforms.” This even as Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar queered the pitch with a no-holds-barred attack on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wondering why she stopped pro-farmer Kisan Sanman Nidhi, a central scheme that benefits the tillers from entering Bengal. He accused the TMC supremo of blocking the passage of Rs 8,400 crore under Kishan Sanman Nidhi and was “shedding crocodile tears” on farm bill. Senior TMC leaders including minister Chandrima Bhattacharya and MPs Saugato Roy and Kalyan Banerjee attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “hitting at the very base of the Indian economy.” Bhattacharya said “first he half-murdered the economy by imposing the demonetisation which was a tricky scheme to convert black money into white money but in actuality it ruined the middle and small sector industry and sucked out crores of jobs. Then there was another foolish scheme of GST which was hurriedly implemented and massacred the market… and finally these two bills. The farm bill will break the back bone of the Indian economy --- perhaps hitting the farmers more than the British East India Company did.” Bhattacharya was leading a sit-in protest in central Kolkata. Even as the BJP leadership desperately tried to reason out with the voters on the “good effects of the Bill” that will “free the farmers from the clutches of the middlemen,” the TMC along with the Left and the Congress roared back saying the bill was brought to compensate the business houses that fund the saffron outfit for the losses they suffered during the lockdown and sluggish market. Processions were taken out in most of the districts, particularly the rural areas even as the TMC leadership said the intensity of the movement would only gather steam in the days to come. Meanwhile, the Governor attacked the Chief Minister for shedding crocodile’s tears even as he tweeted “Urge CM - Crocodile Tears will not relieve pain of farmer,” Subsequently in he told the media how Banerjee had denied the same farmers for whom she was crying now of benefits worth ? 8,400 crores which would go to 70 lakh Bengal farmers. “So far every farmer has lost ? 12,000 that would have come to his bank account,” he tweeted, adding that farmers in other parts of the country had “enormously benefited” from the scheme. He also wrote how “Due to the inaction of Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal farmers have been denied the benefit of ? 30,000 crore of ? 3.5 lakh crores package by central government during the COVID pandemic.” In the evening he followed his tweet with a frontal attack on the Chief Minister saying how a in a letter dated September 9 the State Government had requested the Centre to clear the Kisan Sanman Nidhi funds but with a rider. He said that the State asked the Centre to route the funds through the State Government officials including sending them directly to the farmers’ accounts. Meanwhile, the TMC’s anti-farm bill agitation was complemented by parallel rallies by the Left and the Congress which took out processions condemning the twin laws --- the first one pushing the corporate into the farmers’ domain and the second robbing the common man of the shield against arbitrary hike in the prices of essential commodities.

Daily recoveries surpass new Covid infections,"  With India recording the highest number of Covid-19 recoveries in the world, the Union Health Ministry on Tuesday said for the past four consecutive days the number of daily recovered cases surpassed the new infections reported per day. India has the highest number of recovered cases in the world at 44,97,867, Union Health Ministry Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, addressing a Press briefing here. “India’s Covid-19 cases share is 17.7 per cent of global infections, while those who have recuperated are 19.5 per cent of total recoveries in world. The daily recoveries from Covid-19 more than number of new infections reported per day since past four consecutive days,” he said. While the US’ Covid-19 cases share is 22.4 per cent of global infections, those who have recuperated are 18.6 per cent of total recoveries in world, the data presented by him showed. Brazil’s Covid-19 cases share is 14.5 per cent of global infections, those who have recuperated are 16.8 per cent of total recoveries in world, it showed. So far, India has recorded over 55 lakh confirmed cases, including 87,882 deaths. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have reported the highest number of cases while infections are rising rapidly in States like Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Yet, India’s recovery rate continues to rise and now stands at 80.1 per cent. Bhushan said the number of active Covid-19 cases were less than one-fifth of the total 55,62,663 infections in India. “We get swayed by the narrative that India has over 50 lakh cases, but we forget that nearly 45 lakh people have already recovered,” the health secretary said. “India’s Covid-19 deaths per million population is also amongst the lowest in the world. India has 64 deaths per million population, whereas world’s average stands at 123,” he said. Bhushan added early detection, isolation and seamless hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients has been made possible due to an exponential increase in testing infrastructure in the country. Covid-19 task force member VK Paul (NITI Aayog member) urged people to wear masks and follow all the social distancing norms, specially as the festival season is about to begin next month.  ",india

Another four per cent said they did not get an ICU bed at all. After receiving many complaints from citizens from across the country about their family friends or associates not being able to find an ICU bed at a government or private hospital, LocalCircles conducted a survey to get citizen’s pulse on the issue and received over 17,000 responses from citizens located in over 211 districts of the country. On experiences of people in their social network with regard to getting a COVID-19 ICU bed, 55 per cent citizens said that they did not have any person in their network who needed it. Thirty eight per cent respondents said they had to use clout to secure an ICU bed while seven per cent said they had to follow up extensively to secure the ICU bed.  ",india
"CCMB scientists analyse 2,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India","  Scientists at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad have analysed more than 2,000 SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 genomes from India available in the public domain to understand the various strains in circulation. The clade or genetic group circulating in India has 70 per cent similarity with the major strain around the world, hence ,  one vaccine or drug is sufficient to fight it, they said. Earlier in June, the team had revealed the presence of a distinct virus population among Indians. This was named the clade I/A3i, and is recognised by the presence of 4 specific variations in their genetic makeup (genomes). At that time, 41 per cent of all Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes belonged to this clade. However, the current analysis showed that the proportion of the A3i clade dropped to 18 per cent, it said. The findings of the study done with scientists from CSIR-Institute of Integrative Biology as collaborators, are now peer-reviewed and published in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases published by the Oxford University Press. The decrease in the proportion of A3i clade is accompanied by an increase of the A2a clade, also referred to as the G clade or the 20A/B/C clades in other nomenclatures. Viruses of the A2a or the G clade carry the D614G mutation in their spike protein which is shown to be associated with an increased infectivity. At present, approximately 70 per cent of all Indian as well as global SARS-CoV-2 genomes fall into this clade.  “As expected for a strain which is more infectious, A2a clade quickly became the dominant clade in India just like everywhere else. There is no evidence to state that this mutation is clinically a more difficult one,” Dr Rakesh K Mishra, Director, CCMB and a co-author of the study said. “The similarity in viral genome globally should be considered a positive news, because a vaccine or a drug targeting this mutation will work with the same effectiveness all over the world,” he added. It is, however, important to note that no clade at present has been conclusively shown to be associated with a more severe form of COVID-9, or an increased risk of death, said the scientists.

"NCB LIKELY TO QUIZ ACTRESSES SARA, RAKUL, DESIGNER SIMONE","  Amid the likelihood of Bollywood actresses Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh Singh and fashion designer Simone Khambatta being summoned by it for questioning later this week, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday questioned Suashant’s talent manager Jaya Saha in connection with the ongoing drug case related to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. On a day the informed sources in the investigating confirmed that they would record the statements of Sara, Rahul and Simone under section 67 of the The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, the NCB officials questioned grilled Saha for more than four hours on Monday.  He has been called for questioning once again on Tuesday. Sushant’s ex-manager Shruti Modi will also be questioned by the NCB officials on Tuesday. It may be recalled that Jaya Saha’s name had figured in the WhatsApp chats recovered by the ED from actress Rhea Chakraborty’s mobile phone that reveal that the actress might have been involved in drug dealings. The recovered WhatsApp chats among Rhea, her brother Showik Chakraborty, Sushant’s house manager Samuel Miranda, house staff Dipesh Sawant and Saha had thrown sufficient hints about their alleged involvement in the procurement and use of drugs for Sushant. Though a section of the electronic media was mentioning that actress Shraddha Kapoor would also be called for questioning along with Sara and others, there was no confirmation to that effect from the NCB. Sources said that the NCB would question Sara, Rakul and Simone on the basis of Rhea’s statement recorded by the NCB. The three were among others who used to have drug parties at Sushant’s farm house at Lonavla near Pune.  Rhea had reportedly told the investigators It may be recalled that NCB’s deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra had on September 14 confirmed that the names Sara , Rakul and Simone had figured in the Sushant Singh Raput death-related drug case. “There has been an issue that whether the name of Sara, Simone and Rakul surfaced during the investigation…the answer to that is yes,” Malhotra had said, while talking to media persons. As many as 16 persons have so far been arrested in the Sushant Singh Raput death-related drug case registered by the NCB. Actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik are two of the arrested accused in the case. A descendent of the Tagore and Pataudi families, Sara (25) is the daughter of actor Saif Ali Khan and his first wife Amrita Singh and grand-daughter of  late Indian cricket captain MAK Pataudi and actor and former Censor Board chairperson Sharmila Tagore. Sushant and Sara had worked together in the 2018 film Kedarnath, a Hindi romantic drama. Rakul Preet (29) has acted in several Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films, while Simone (29) is a fashion designer and social media influencer. Unconfirmed reports had earlier said that during the course of her prolonged questioning by the NCB ahead of her arrest on September 8, actress Rhea Chakraborty had reportedly told the investigators that actress Sara Ali Khan and Rakul Preet, designer Simone Khambatta, Sushant's friend and former manager Rohini Iyer and filmmaker Mukesh Chhabra consumed narcotics substances. However, Rhea – after her arrest – Rhea has retracted her statement. Meanwhile, the questioning of the Jaya Saha by the NCB should be seen in the context of the WhatsApp chats recovered by the ED.   In one of the chats between Rhea and Gaurav Arya who is allegedly a drug dealer, Rhea writes: “In case we speak about hard drugs, I haven’t been doing too much. Tried MDMA once”. In another message sent to Gaurav Arya, she asks: “You have MD?”  One message sent to her by one Jaya Saha on November 25 last year says, “Use 4 drops in coffee, tea or water and let him sip it. Give it 30-40 minutes for it to kick in.”  Then, there emerges a message in a chat between Rhea & Jaya Saha: “I have asked him to coordinate with Shruti (Modi) & reach it up”. In yet another message, Rhea writes to  Jaya Saha “Thank you so much” Reply from Jaya:  “No problem bro, hope it helps”. In the first chat message, Miranda writes to Rhea” “Hi Rhea, the stuff is almost over”. In the next message, Jaya Saha tells Rhea:  ‘Use 4 drops in tea, let him sip it …. Give it 30-40 mins to kick in’.  In the seventh and last accessed chat message, Miranda writes to Rhea: “‘Should we take it from Showik’s friend? But he has just hash & bud’, The WA chat messages hint at the fact that Rhea was allegedly procuring drugs for use. The one message sent to Rhea by Jaya Saha on November 25 last year had indirectly hinted that she was allegedly mixing the drug in coffee, tea or water and giving it to Sushant.  ",india

These arrests smack of a conspiracy,” said Hameed Vaniyambalam, WPI, president, in a statement released to the media.

World's longest high-altitude tunnel fully ready to open in Himachal,"  The world''s longest high-altitude tunnel on Manali-Leh national highway is fully ready to open in Himachal Pradesh''s Lahaul-Spiti district, a senior Border Road Organisation (BRO) official said on Sunday. The 9-km Atal tunnel built at an altitude of about 10,000 feet above sea level in Lahaul Spiti''s Rohtang is likely to be formally inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in coming weeks, said BRO Chief Engineer, Brigadier K P Purshothaman. ''We are ready for its opening anytime after September 25. PM may open it in the last week of this month or first week of the next month,” Brig K P Purshothaman told PTI. No official confirmation has been received so far, we may get it within a couple of days, he said, adding it is also not yet clear if it would be a virtual opening due to the corona crisis or a physical one. The Atal Tunnel built at a cost of about Rs 3,500 crore is extremely significant from the defence point of view. This will not only shorten the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km but will also be beneficial for the residents of Lahaul-Spiti especially during the winter, a state official spokesperson said. Once thrown open, the tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to remote border areas of Himachal Pradesh''s Lahaul-Spiti and Leh-Ladakh which otherwise remain cut-off from the rest of the country for about six months due to heavy snowfall during winters, he added. The BRO worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah Fault zone. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017. Brig Purshothaman said the tunnel provides a telephone facility at every 150 metre of its stretch, a fire hydrant every 60 metre, emergency exits every 500 metre, turning cavern every 2.2 km, air quality monitors every one km, broadcasting system and automatic incident detection system with CCTV cameras every 250 metre. It is a 10.5-metre wide single tube bi-lane tunnel with a fire proof emergency egress tunnel built into the main tunnel itself. The historic decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang pass was taken on June 3, 2000 when late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister. The foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. The Union government on December 25 last year named the strategic tunnel under the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in a tribute to him on his 95th birth anniversary. HP Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur visited Rohtang on August 29 to review the progress on the Atal Tunnel.            ",india
"Kangana, NCW chief extend support to actress","  The Bollywood-Kangana Ranaut discourse touched a new low on Sunday, as the film “Queen” fame actress took up cudgels for model-turned actress Payal Ghosh a day after the latter made sexual assault charge against Anurag Kashyap, and washed dirty linen in public by targeting the filmmaker. The public spat gained currency as National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma threw her weight behind Payal Ghosh and assured the latter the NCW would look into the complaint against Anurag Kashyap over an alleged sexual assault incident that allegedly took place in 2014-15. Though a video message, the NCW chief extended her support to Payal saying:   “I saw the tweet yesterday that Payal Ghosh has alleged that in 2015 Anurag Kashyap had sexually harassed her. This is a shocking revelation....I wrote to her that if you wish to complain, you can send a detailed complaint to me, and we will take action accordingly. We will also write to the police....We stand with her till the probe is on, till it is presented before the court. I want to tell Payal Ghosh that NCW with her.” Much to Anurag’s comfort, his first ex-wife Aarti Bajaj rushed to the support of  filmmaker who she called  a “rock star” and said Payal’s was “cheapest stunt I have seen till now”. Others like actress Taapsee Pannu and filmmaker Anubhav Sinha threw their lot with Anurag.         After their spat over Rhea Chakraborty (whom the filmmaker had supported her earlier and the actress opposed  in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case), the second round of verbal battle between Anurag and Kangana broke out a day after Payal – who made a debut in Bollywood in “Patel Ki Punjabi Shaadi” (2017) after acting in half a dozen south Indian films – went to town through a tweet seeking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention over an alleged incident that took place in 2014-15. “@anuragkashyap72 has forced himself on me and extremely badly. @PMOIndia @narendramodi ji, kindly take action and let the country see the demon behind this creative guy. I am aware that it can harm me and my security is at risk. Pls help!,” Payal tweeted. “People who are saying that it's for politics and that I am misusing the situation. Imagine ( god forbid) your sister or daughter in my position, it can even be the mother.. and then let's talk. You would go to war against such men. Isn't it ? PERIOD!!,” Payal said in another tweet. Among other things Payal alleged in an interview aired by  news channel ABN Telugu that Anurag Kashyap sexually assaulted her in 2014-15 that the latter  did an inappropriate gesture while seeking a sexual act from her, after inviting her into another room. Payal also claimed that Anurag had allegedly boasted about other actresses agreeing to his similar demands, and that many were ready to ‘sleep with him just to share a frame with Ranbir Kapoor’. Anurag’s ambitious film Bombay Velvet had not released then. The “Manikarnika” fame jumped to Payal’s rescue and put out a series of tweets against Anurag Kashyap who, she said, “Anurag self admittedly has never been monogamous” and “Anurag is very much capable of doing what #PayalGhosh suggesting”. “Anurag is very much capable of doing what #PayalGhosh suggesting, he cheated on all his partners, self admittedly has never been monogamous. Phantomwas full of womanisers many #MeToo accused, I supported those victims before also and librals started smear campaigns against me,” Kangana tweeted. “As far as I know Anurag self admittedly has never been monogamous even when he was married to various people, what Anurag did to Payal is a common practice in Bullywood, treating struggling outsider girls like sex workers comes naturally to them #AnuragKashyap #PayalGhosh,” she said in another tweet. “Bullywood is full of sexual predators who have fake and dummy marriages they expect a new hot young girl to make them happy every day, they do the same to young vulnerable men also,I have settled my scores my way I don’t need #MeToo but most girls do #PayalGhosh #AnuragKashyap,” she tweeted. Kangana, who has been reckless in speaking her mind out in recent weeks, came with an utterly low-taste tweet, saying:  “What #PayalGhosh says many big heroes have done this to me also, suddenly flash their genitals after locking van or room door or in a party during a friendly dance on the dance floor stick his tongue in your mouth, take appointment for work and come home but force himself on you”. On his part, Anurag has denied Paya’s charge that he had ‘forced himself on (her)’ when she met him for professional reasons, some years ago. He called the charge “absolutely baseless” and said that he neither indulges in nor condones such kind of behaviour. Anurag hit back at Payal through tweets “Kya baat hai, itna samay le liya mujhe chup karwane ki koshish mein. Chalo koi nahin. Mujhe chup karaate karaate itna jhooth bol gaye ki aurat hote hue doosri auraton ko bhi sang ghaseet liya. Thodi toh maryada rakhiye, madam. Bas yahi kahunga ki jo bhi aarop hain aap ke sab bebuniyaad hain (Wow, it took you so long to try to silence me. Never mind. In the process of silencing me, you dragged other women in this, despite being a woman. Please have some dignity, madam. All I want to say is that every allegation is baseless)” Anurag’s ex-wife Aarti Bajaj took to Instagram to extend support to the filmmaker whom she called a “rock star”,  said Payal’s was  “cheapest stunt I have seen till now” and vouched  for Anurag’s efforts to create the safest place for the women who work with him. “First wife here.. You are a rockstar @anuragkashyap10. Keep empowering women as you do and the safest place you create for all of them. I see it first hand with our daughter. There is no integrity left and the world is full of losers and no brains baying for blood of anyone who has a voice,” Aarti said in her Instagram post.  “If everybody spends the energy which they use in hating others constructively this world will be a better place. Cheapest stunt I have seen till now. First it made me angry then I laughed so hard as it cannot come more framed then this. I am sorry that you have to go through this .That’s the level of them. You stay HIGH and keep using your voice. We love you,” Aarati added. Actress Taapsee Pannu threw her weight behind Anurag in the face of allegations  made against him by Payal.  Sharing a picture with Anurag, Taapsee wrote on Instagram, “For you, my friend, are the biggest feminist I know.

Despite having information, the administrative officers are not taking any action. There is a shortage of oxygen cylinders used in industrial units since 24th August. Oxygen gas is used in Hardware, Brass & Silver idols, Statue, Fridge, AC, and other job works, for this the factories of the city need 3000 cylinders daily. Now the supply is shrunken to only 10% which affects the idol and hardware business. These units are used to get cylinders from the refilling plant in the city. The operators of these 3 refilling plants in the city prepared oxygen from the liquid. There was no lack of oxygen in the industries and healthy service till the last week of August but with the increasing corona patients, oxygen demand also shoots up. The brass idols and hardware are a multi-million business of the city. The brass idol business has an annual turnover of Rs 500 crores while the annual turnover of the hardware business is Rs 20,000 crores. A 10 cubic meter capacity oxygen cylinders are generally used in the industries which cost Rs 350, but this cylinder sold on 1st September in Rs 550. After 6 days, it was sold at an elevated price of Rs 450 and a few days later its price increased to Rs 1000. Dealers also billed the same amount of money without fear. There were also complaints about less gas in many cylinders. Idol manufacturer Kapil Varshney said that he bought 2 cylinders from his hardware business friend for Rs 2400. He further said that orders have to be completed and delivered before Navratri. There is tremendous black marketing on the name of the oxygen gas shortage. Cylinders are being sold from different places rather then godown. Job worker Lokesh Sharma said that he is doing job work and not getting the cylinder for the last 3 days but today he bought Rs 350 cylinder in Rs 1200 and that too without any bill. The administration is not paying attention. Thousands of workers have become unemployed due to the closure of the factories.

District Magistrate and Divisional Commissioner have been informed that industries are not getting oxygen. Had discussions with businessmen as well. Modi Nagar plant will be going to start from 1st Oct, after that we are hoping to get enough and uninterrupted supply. Refilling plant owner Suresh Chandra told that plants preparing oxygen gas for industries are not getting liquid for refilling. We also have business relationships with businessmen. Since the last days, there has been a rift in these relations. The rate of Liquid has been increased up to 3 times. The administration should interfere in this matter. Vipin Bihari Gupta, Director of the brass statue and hardware manufacturers and supplier association said that festivals like Navratri and Diwali are near. The market is already affected badly due to the corona pandemic and now we are battling for oxygen. The livelihood of thousands of people got affected. 80% of production is already stopped.  ",india

Pak has been eliminating its Sikh population for decades: Author,"  Pakistan has been eliminating its Sikh population for decades through killings,  abductions and forced marriages of young women, yet is funding and fueling Khalistani terrorism and separatist movement globally to achieve it sinister plans to break up India, a Canadian expert, who authored a recently released report on the subject, has said. Terry Milewski, who wrote the September  9 report “Khalistan: A Project of Pakistan” published by the Canadian think-tank MacDonald-Laurier Institute, said the Khalistani terrorist had sworn their allegiance to Pakistan, which in turn has pledged to play the tunes of China. He made these observations at a webinar “Khalistani Terrorism and Canada” organised by Delhi-headquartered think-tank Law and Society Alliance and strategic affairs publication Defence.Capital through video conferencing over the weekend. The MacDonald-Laurier Institute report has triggered an intense global debate on Khalistani terrorism, and exposing Pakistan’s major hand in it. Milewski said his report had exposed the Khalistan extremists and Pakistan, where real Sikhs still suffer from forcible conversion to Islam, attack on Gurudwara, abductions and killings. He said the trigger for writing the report even after 35 years of the Khalistani terrorists’ Air India bombing, the largest mass killing Canada has ever seen and its victims yet to see complete justice delivered, was the ambitious Khalistan map that he saw of the ‘Referendum 2020’ campaign. The proposed Khalistan map had included several parts of India, including some landmass of Rajasthan, the entire Indian side of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. “But this map, put up by Sikhs For Justice as part of the voter enlisting exercise in Canada, did not claim a single inch of Pakistani territory as part of Khalistan. It should have included Lahore, from where Maharaja Ranjit Singh ran an empire, and Nakanana Sahib, where Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born. Why are those parts of land with Sikh history being left out? The answer is that people who are organising the movement for Khalistan cannot afford to run the campaign without Pakistan’s monetary and other kinds of support. They do not want to annoy their masters.” Milewski said he had seen the open Pakistan support to the extremist Khalistani during the August 15 protests organised in front of Indian missions in Canada.

Home Ministry stresses on border management,"  The Union Home Ministry has stressed that border management along frontiers with Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar should be emphasized as seriously as those along the borders with China and Pakistan. Border guarding forces like Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and Assam Rifles have been asked to hold meetings with Union Home Secretary Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL) to identify technological solutions for improved border management. The decision was taken by Union Home Ministry Amit Shah on April 2 to review the progress of the recommendations made during his meeting with the border guarding forces late last year, officials said.  The move assumes significance as the frontiers along Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar are considered friendly. Strengthening border management on the alignment with these countries could be seen in the backdrop of either China’s footprint in these countries or Beijing’s likely intent to provoke them in order to reduce Indian influence in the region. In the backdrop of Doklam faceoff and Chinese designs, Shah was alerted and in a farsighted move sought prompt strengthening of border guarding mechanism, officials added.  ",india
ICMR mulls saliva-based test for Covid-19 detection: Vardhan,"  The ICMR is actively exploring saliva-based test for detection of COVID-19, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday and asserted that no significant or drastic mutation in strains of SARS-CoV-2 has been found in India till now. During an interaction with his social media followers on ‘Sunday Samvad’ platform , Dr Harsh Vardhan informed them the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus collected for several months over different time-points. Detailed results on mutations and evolution of the virus will be available in early October, he said. Meanwhile, India’s first CRISPR Covid-19 test ‘Feluda’ that claims to match accuracy levels of traditional RT-PCR tests, with quicker turnaround time has been given nod by the Drug Controller General of India. “Feluda met the high-quality benchmarks with 96 per cent sensitivity and 98 per cent specificity for detecting the novel coronavirus,” said the joint statement by Tata Group and CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology which have jointly developed the test. CRISPR is a genome-editing technology to diagnosing diseases. “The Tata CRISPR test is the world’s first diagnostic test to deploy a specially adapted Cas9 protein to successfully detect the virus causing Covid-19. This marks a significant achievement for the Indian scientific community, moving from R&D to a high-accuracy, scalable and reliable test in less than 100 days. The Tata CRISPR test achieves accuracy levels of traditional RT-PCR tests, with quicker turnaround time, less expensive equipment, and better ease of use. Moreover, CRISPR is a futuristic technology that can also be configured for detection of multiple other pathogens in the future,” the statement added. Tata described it as a ‘Made in India’ product that is “safe, reliable, affordable, and accessible”  ",india
Mandatory for PG med students to serve in designated district hosps for 3 mths,"  In a move aimed to ensure  trained health human resources across the districts, postgraduate (PG) medical students, from both private and Government medical colleges, will have to compulsorily serve in a designated district hospital (100 bedded or more) for three months. Besides meeting the human resource shortage at the district level, the measure would also help expose the future physicians/specialists of wide-ranging clinical material and enables them to learn care of such patients in ecosystems with varied resources and teams. Paving way for such move, the Board of Governors at the Medical Council of India (MCI) has launched a District Residency Program from the current academic session 2020 and a gazette notification has been issued in this regard. Such rotation shall take place in the 3rd or 4th or 5th semester of the Postgraduate program and postgraduate medical students undergoing training shall be termed as a ‘District Resident’. The Programme will be implemented with the PG (broad specialty) batch joining in 2020, stated gazette notification, which also laid down the details of the program. Following the amendment of the Post-graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, a new clause has been added to incorporate the District Residency Programme. The programme is for all PG medical students in government and private medical colleges including those affiliated to deemed universities and students who fail to complete the course will not be allowed to take their final exams. District hospitals represent the backbone of the country’s secondary-level health care providing specialty treatment. These hospitals are closer to people and an overwhelming source of services in rural and urban areas. The student will be drawing full stipend/salary from their medical colleges during this duration and would also be getting a certificate at the end of their training.  ",india
Opp blames Govt for lapses in curbing Covid pandemic,"  Lok Sabha on Sunday debated the Covid-19 scenario across the country with the initiator of the debate RSP MP NK Premachandran, ironically, unable to attend as he tested positive on Saturday. Opposition MPs highlighted many lapses in the administration for the past six months to tackle the pandemic and blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for declaring lockdown within four hours, leading to chaos and miseries in public and migrant labourers fleeing back to their home towns from their work places. BJP MPs countered the Opposition charges and highlighted the faults in administration in the Opposition-ruled states like Maharashtra. Opening up the debate, Speaker Om Birla assured that he will give chance to all MPs and urged them to bring out the problems faced in their constituencies. “This debate should be specific. Come with your experiences,” he said, opening the floor for the more than four hour long debate. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor highlighted the lacunas in the health administration of the country in tackling the pandemic and blamed the Government for having no data on this regard. He charged the Government with creating disasters in economy, administration and employment losses during the pandemic due to non-consultative nature with the Opposition parties. “The creation of a Government-made disaster laid the foundations for the widespread distress and anguish that followed a series of events that should haunt each of us and has tarnished this Government’s moral standing. “Across the country, we know about the long lines that immediately sprung up outside our kirana shops as shocked citizens queued up to purchase critical rations to see this period through. Thousands took to our bus depots and railway stations. People made desperate attempts to make it back to their respective homes. Businessmen and women who had travelled to other cities for meetings were stranded by the PM’s high-handed actions and those overseas suddenly were left with no way to return back to the country,” said Tharoor inviting counters from BJP. Opposition MPs including Karti Chidambaram critcised Prime Minister for “unscientific” measures like lighting and hitting on plates from balconies. BJP MPs, including Kirit Premjibhai Solanki, highlighted the slew of measures implemented by the Centre to tackle the pandemicand accused the Opposition of “involving in just blame games.” BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan were always in touch with all opposition leaders and Chief Ministers across the country and improvising measures on a regular basis. “Everybody was united. In Hyderabad, Owaisi and RSS were united in the field to serve people. It is unfair that you criticizing us unnecessarily,” said Dubey urging the Opposition MPs to consult their Chief Ministers before leveling allegations.  ",india
"Farm reform Bills anti-farmers, says Cong","  Soon after Union Minister Rajnath Singh briefed the media over the controversial farm Bills, Congress said the legislations, which were passed in Rajya Sabha amid a din, are against the interest of farmers and the day will be remembered as a black day for democracy. The party announced to move a no confidence motion against Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh who, according to Congress and other Opposition parties, did not pay heed to the demands of the Opposition benches and by action completely favoured and worked for the Government. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is abroad, tweeted  that the farmers grow gold from land, but the arrogance of the Modi government is making farmers shed tears of blood. “I saw the press conference by Rajnath Singh and five other Ministers. They are justifying Deputy Chairman’s action and attitude. That was very unfortunate. We expected decent reaction from senior Ministers. They should have at least condemned the practice by Deputy Chairman,” said Congress leader KC Venugopal during press briefing. He was joined by party leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Randeep Surjewala, Rajeev Satav and Pratap Singh Bajwa. “The members become upset. Everyone went in the well of the House. BJP leader Bhupinder Yadav was also seen whispering in Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman’s ear. What conspiracy is happening? Today’s entire episode was a conspiracy by BJP leaders. We are not going to leave this issue,” Venugopal said addressing late event press conference.  ",india
"Rajnath allays farmers’ fear, says MSP, APMC will continue","  The Government on Sunday fielded Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who pitched himself as a ‘farmer’ and showcased his credentials as a former Agriculture Minister, to allay the fears of the farmers over the farm Bills passed by the Parliament. Singh said he wanted to send a clear message to the farmers that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) would continue for their benefit. Strongly condemning the behaviour of the Opposition parties against Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh Narayan Singh, the Defence Minister described it as “very shameful”. He, however, left the question of no confidence motion proposed by the Opposition against the Deputy Chairman to the discretion of the Chairman of the Rajya sabha M Venkaiah Naidu. On the question as to why the Government does not remove the misgivings on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) by guaranteeing it in the Bill as was suggested by the RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Rajanth, who was addressing a press conference along with five other Union Ministers, said such was never done in the Act . He said the Government has increased the MSP and been successful “to a large  extent” towards “doubling the income of the farmers” and “we are moving further in the direction”. Condemning the ruckus in the RS, he said he was “ deeply pained” by the misbehaviour  by Opposition members with ‘Harivashji’ who, he said, always practiced high values. The Minister said it was unprecedented in the history of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for members to tear the rule-book and stand on the chair of the Deputy-Chairman. The Minister said the opposition actions in the upper house, which is described as “house of elders”, were  very sad. Its “mere condemnation is not enough”.  “ This has deeply hurt and  lowered the  parliamentary dignity,” he said On the question of opposition contemplating no-confidence motion against Harivansh, Rajnath said it was the  “prerogative of the Chairman of the RS to decide on the  issue.” When asked why the Deputy-Chairman did not accept the demand of a division in the house, Union Minister of state for Minority Affairs Mikhtar Abbas Naqvi responded by saying that the Deputy Chairman asked opposition MPs to go back to their seats but instead he was encircled and were “slogan-shouting”. Besides Rajnath and Naqvi, other union ministers included Prakash Javadekar, Prahlad Joshi, Thawarchand Gehlot and Piyush Goyal.  ",india
India should talk to Pakistan to defuse border row: Farooq,"  Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Saturday sought talks with Pakistan, saying if India can talk to China to defuse their border row, it can also speak to its other neighbour to deal with the situation at the Union Territory’s borders. He also demanded a restoration of 4-G internet services in the UT. “Border skirmishes have been rising and people are dying… A way has to be found to deal with this. Except for talks… As you are talking to China to attempt that it withdraws (from Ladakh border), we should also talk to our (other) neighbour to find a way to get out of this situation,” he said in Lok Sabha during the Zero Hour amid shouting from treasury benches. Abulllah was speaking in the Parliament for the first time after his release from the detention following the change in the Union Territory status and bifurcation of the erstwhile state in the wake of abrogation of article 370, last year. He was released in March this year.

NEP tailored to meet 21st century edu needs: Kovind,"  President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said the new National Education Policy (NEP) aims to reorient the education system towards meeting the needs of the 21st century by achieving the twin objectives of inclusion and excellence and will also restore India’s glory as a learning centre. Speaking at the inaugural address of Visitors’ Conference on ‘Implementation of NEP in Higher Education’, Kovind said the policy sets the vision of developing an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing quality education to all. Vice Chancellors of all Central Universities and Directors of IITs, NITs, SPAs etc were present on the occasion besides the Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and top Ministry officials. He drew inspiration from Bhagvad Gita and the Krishna-Arjun dialogue while reiterating the concept of free communication and discussion between the teacher and the student. “Effective implementation of the NEP 2020 is likely to restore India’s glory as a great centre of learning as during the times of Takshashila and Nalanda,” Kovind added. The President said according to the All India Survey of Higher Education for 2018-19, GER for females is slightly higher than that for males. However, the share of female students is extremely low in Institutions of National Importance and particularly low in technical education. Emphasising that NEP has focus on equity and inclusion, he said that such gender disparity in higher education should be corrected. Union Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said the NEP has given access to foreign universities to open campuses in India and vice-versa which will be instrumental in the process of making India a soft power, the Minister added.

RS passes Epidemic Diseases Amendment Bill to protect health workers,"  The Rajya Sabha on Saturday  passed two legislations, The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill 2020 and The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill provides for up to five years in jail for those attacking doctors and healthcare workers fighting the COVID-19 outbreak or during any situation akin to the current pandemic. Speaking on the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the bill was required to prevent offences against healthcare professionals. “Many healthcare workers including doctors, paramedics were insulted in some form or the other, due to stigma attached to COVID-19. Centre government acted on this situation found that there was a need for a law, a prohibitory mechanism against such incidents,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said. However, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Derek O’Brien termed the Bill an attempt to encroach states’ constitutionally assigned functioning. Speaking while the discussions on the bill were underway, the TMC MP said that Bengal already had laws to deal with prevention of violence against doctors and healthcare workers. “You thought of healthcare workers now? Bengal has Medicare Service Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property Act 2009. What happens to it? Bill is an attempt to encroach states’ constitutionally assigned functioning,” O’Brien said. The Upper House had earlier passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Second Amendment) Bill. Moving the IBC Bill in Rajya Sabha Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “IBC is such a critical part of business now. On the NPAs of scheduled commercial banks, I just want to highlight how IBC is actually serving the purpose.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a public servant dedicated to public sentiment","  Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare It is the responsibility of any Government to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the people and bring positive changes in the lives of the poor.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been efficiently discharging this responsibility through his hard work for the last six years.  On September 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to complete 70 years of his life.  This is the best time to observe his great personality and the many works of public welfare that are taking place under his leadership. Since independence, governments have formulated their own policy from time to time on basic amenities like health and education in India. Ever since I came into politics, I used to hear the same slogan, ‘Poverty be removed’, but without knowing the origin of this poverty, the governments decided the policy due to which they did not appear successful in removing poverty.  There was a time when people at the top of power said that money is sent from Delhi, but it does not reach the people completely.  Today you see how when the leadership is in skilled and capable hands, then the picture of the country and the fate of the common people changes.  Our inspirational Pandit Dayanalji gave us the mantra of Antyodaya, today this mantra has become the mantra of our government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi created the policy knowing the basic problems of poverty so that the gap between this government and the poor can be ended.  Gone.  There are many such schemes which have proved effective in raising the standard of living of the poor.  Whether it is about Jan Dhan Yojana or Mudra Yojana, Ayushman Yojana or Ujjwala or Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, public welfare was given paramount in all schemes.  More than that, we have been successful in getting the benefit of the schemes to the beneficiary in a shorter time than the target.  This change has come under the guidance of the Prime Minister of India, we know this in the name of good governance.  In this era of epidemic, we have benefited every poor person in the country through various schemes. Today, when the whole world is battling the corona virus disease, under the leadership of our Prime Minister, India is not only fighting this deadly virus but is also working to give a message to the world.  That message is about humanity, the sense of responsibility of the government. This virus posed a new challenge for the whole world.  Immediately after the virus started spreading in China, on 8 January, under the leadership and guidance of the Prime Minister, the government started taking a meeting with experts with utmost seriousness. On 30 January, before the first case of Corona was found in India, India started thermal screening of all the passengers coming from China.  We also had 6 labs and 6 quarantine centers.  Certainly, under the leadership of our famous Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the health structure of the country was getting ready to fight against this invisible enemy.  In February, the government also started screening people from other countries such as Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia.  Our government also issued advisory for travelers going to Italy, South Korea.  We started universal thermal screening in early March.  The Prime Minister advised citizens across the country not to gather crowds on Holi and distanced themselves from all the events. The public curfew was announced only in March when there were less than 200 cases.  After this, on March 24, a 21-day lockdown was announced.  After the nationwide lockdown, our Prime Minister, who was filled with the spirit of public welfare, released a poor welfare economic package of 1 lakh 70 thousand crore.  He gave this message to the world that it is possible to compensate for the loss of money, but it is not possible to compensate for the loss of public.  The Prime Minister said that ‘Jaan hai to jahan hai’.  Gradually, when our health structure was completely ready to beat Corona.  As of 15 September, we have 1690 Kovid dedicated hospitals.  Where the counting experiment was done initially.  Today, the number of government and private laboratories is 1736.  It is increasing daily.  Our recovery rate is increasing daily by 15 September and it has reached 79%.  About 4 million corona infections have been cured.  Testing capacity has exceeded 1 million tests per day.  On 15 September, 11 lakh 16 thousand 882 tests were held.  Our death rate is much lower than other countries.  This was the question in everyone’s mind that how the economic loss will be reduced, and how the financial speed will get to the country, then the Prime Minister announced the self-sufficient India campaign.  Under this, a package of twenty lakh crore rupees was earmarked for all sectors.  It would be called the foresight of the leadership that we took care of everyone from migrant workers to street vendors and farmers.  People are also getting the benefit of this scheme at a fast pace.  Under Nabard, under the Self-Reliant India Package, 30 thousand crores for farmers, refunds of more than 1 lakh crores were given to more than 27 lakh taxpayers from 1 April till now.  During this time, record sales of medicines have been recorded in various areas such as Jan Aushadhi centers.  Sales of 191.90 crore by the end of July.  The simple reason for this is that the prices of medicines at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper by 50 to 90 percent. During this time the biggest success was that all the beneficiaries got direct benefits of the scheme without any middlemen.  His money came directly into his account.  For example, farmers have been sent money through DBT to farmers, including Kisan Samman Nidhi, women Jan Dhan account holders, our construction workers and other beneficiaries. In the account of about 42.08 crore beneficiaries, the Modi government has 68.820 with complete transparency.  Has sent crore  Prime Minister Modi has fought this battle in a phased manner.  With no goal to sleep, the Prime Minister announced the scheme of the Garib Kalyan Yojana, the self-sufficient Bharat Abhiyan was announced to speed up the economic situation, more than 63 lakh migrant laborers were brought to their homes safely by labor special trains.  The food scheme was expanded so that they got free food.  Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana was announced for his employment.  Apart from this, establishing mutual coordination with all the states, communicating from time to time, encouraging health workers, sanitation workers and police personnel, while being devoted to the spirit of public welfare, the Prime Minister considered Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam as the base of the world.  India helped those countries which sought help at the time of this crisis.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also praised by the WHO, including many heads of state, for creating and implementing an effective strategy in the fight against Corona.  When the country moved towards unlocking, Modi ji said that both life and world too.  The Prime Minister’s addresses renewed consciousness among the citizens of the country. On every front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was completely successful in winning the trust of every citizen of the country.  Coming to the country all the time, he worked to increase enthusiasm and confidence in the people.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proved his acceptance not only in the country but also abroad and has increased the pride of India.  Seoul’s Peace Prize, countries like Bahrain, America, Champions of the Earth (United Nations), Maldives Russia and the UAE also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the award. The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is living his public life, full of discipline, he is well-deserved.  Their hard work inspires us.  On his birthday, I pray to God that he should continue to take the country on the path of development with a sense of public welfare.  ",india

The Minister also said the government continues to respond appropriately to Pakistan’s malicious actions and propaganda, including on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, at various international fora. The question was asked by BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia. Taking strong exception to the provocative act by Pakistan, India had on Tuesday walked out of a meeting of the National Security Advisors(NSA)of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SC0). The Ministry of External Affairs said what Pakistan did was in “blatant disregard to host Russia’s advisory”.  ",india

IMA flays Govt over hiding data on Covid fatalities among healthcare staff,"  The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has slammed the Government for failing to reveal the data on the number of healthcare staff who have been affected and who died from Covid-19, when the Parliament debated the issue. It said that at least 382 doctors across the country have lost their lives in the line of duty so far, but Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan could not come up with the number of fatalities occurred in the medical fraternity when asked by MP Binoy Viswam in Parliament recently. Besides, the IMA, which represents a battery of private doctors from across the country. also released the data of the doctors who died due to Covid-19. “Health is a state subject. Such data is not maintained at Central level,” Vardhan had told Viswam in a written reply. In a reaction to Vardhan’s statement, the IMA said, “If a government does not maintain the statistics of total number of doctors and health care workers infected by Covid-19 and the statistics of how many of them sacrificed their life due to the pandemic, it loses the moral authority to administer the Epidemic Act 1897 and the Disaster Management Act.” The IMA also stated that the reply by the Union Minister also exposes the hypocrisy of calling the healthcare workers ‘corona warriors’ while denying them and their families the status and benefits of martyrdom. The IMA also expressed concerns at the huge number of deaths of doctors and health care workers. “Doctors suffered four times mortality of ordinary citizens, and private practitioners suffered eight times mortality on the same scale. To feign that this information does not merit the attention of the nation is abominable,” said the IMA. The doctors’ body  also objected to the statement made by Ashwini Kumar Chaubey, Minister of State (MoS) for Health, that insurance compensation data is not available with the Union Government in Parliament. “IMA finds it strange that after having formulated an unfriendly partial insurance scheme for the bereaved families to struggle with the ignominy of the Government disowning them altogether stares at them,” it added.

"India can get Covid vaccine by early ’21, Parliament told","  The Centre on Thursday informed the Parliament that the COVID-19 vaccine will be made available in India by the beginning of 2021. Addressing the Rajya Sabha over the coronavirus situation in the country, Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan said that India is also making efforts like other nations and three vaccine candidates are in different phases of clinical trials. “Three vaccine candidates (Zydus Cadila, Bharat Biotech, and the Serum Institute of India) are in different phases. Under Prime Minister’s guidance, an expert group is looking at it and there is advanced planning in place. We are hopeful that by the start of next year a vaccine will be available in India,” the Health Minister informed the upper house after a total of four hours of debate during the last three days in the Rajya Sabha. Harshvardhan’s remarks come at a time when India has reported over 50 lakh cases and people are expecting a vaccine at the earliest. On the criticism that Government made no effort to tackle the pandemic menace at early signals, Harshvardhan stated that the PM, the ministers, and state health ministers have been addressing the situation since January 8 fighting this battle together. He said that detailed advisories had been circulated even before the first COVID-19 case was detected in India on January 30. The Union Minister further noted that “extensive contact-tracing was undertaken” with 162 contacts being traced to the first case. Harshvardhan said the PM has handled Covid-19 “meticulously.” “History will remember Prime Minister Narendra Modi for meticulously monitoring the entire situation himself,” he said. Responding to Congress MP Anand Sharma’s query on how large number of people was prevented from being infected, Harshvardhan said that six scientific agencies gave scientific data on the basis of which it was stated the 14-29 lakh cases were prevented by the coronavirus lockdown. While the vaccine candidates undertaken by Zydus Cadila and Bharat Biotech have completed phase 1 of human tests, SII has resumed its trials after getting clearance from the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI). SII is the manufacturing partner of the vaccine candidate being developed jointly by UK-based pharma giant AstraZeneca and University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute. The Pune-based company is looking after the human tests being conducted at 17 trial sites across the country.  ",india
Maha: Cong stages stir against Centre’s ban on onion export,"  Wearing onion garlands around their necks, the Congress staged protests in Nashik district – which has the country’s largest onion market at Lasalgaon and other parts of Maharashtra, against the Narendra Modi Government’s decision to ban exports of onions. In Nashik district which is the epi-centre of protests against the “anti-farmer” policies of the Modi government, the Congress workers – accompanied by onion growing farmers –raised vociferous slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre. On Tuesday, the onion growers and traders had staged a dharna at the market yard of the APMC market at Lasalgaon in Nashik district. “At a time when the farmers in the state have  started to recover from the Covid-19 induced losses, the Modi government has once again dashed their hopes. At a time when the onion crop was fetching good prices in the market, the Modi government suddenly decided to ban exports, causing huge losses to farmers,” Maharashtra Congress president and State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said.  “There is anger among the farmers against the Modi government’s decision to ban onion exports and the state government stands firmly with the farmers.  The Congress’ agitation will continue till the time the union government withdraws the ban on onion exports,” Thorat said. Slamming the Modi government’s decision to ban onion exports, Thorat said: “Recently, the Centre’s decision to import milk powder deprived the opportunity to thousands of dairy farmers to sell tonnes of milk powder lying with them,  resulting in a drop in milk prices. Just as when onions were fetching a good price in the market, a decision to ban exports was taken which has led to the price of onion crashing by Rs 700-800 per quintal”. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday expressed serious displeasure over the Centre’s decision to ban onion exports. At the weekly State Cabinet meeting, Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat criticised the Centre for its “anti-farmer” decision of banning the export of onions. Briefing the ministers present,  Principal Secretary Anup Kumar said that during 2018-19 farmers from Maharashtra had exported 21.83 metric tonnes of Onion, while they had exported 18.50 metric tonnes of onion during 2019-20. Senior Minister Eknath Shinde told the Cabinet that currently, 4 lakh metric tonnes were lying at the Jawahar Nehru Port, while more than 500 trucks carrying onions were waiting in a queue near the Nepal border.

Prof Habib: Raja Mahendra Pratap not mentioned giving land to AMU,"  In the preparations to give back the land leased by Aligarh Muslim University to the descendants of King Mahendra Pratap, the famous historian Professor Irfan Habib has said that despite being close to him, Raja Mahendra Pratap never told him that he had given any land to Aligarh Muslim University. This matter is between the taker and the giver. A 90-year-old Professor Irfan Habib has said that in 1962, he helped Raja Mahendra Pratap in contesting Parliament election. He and his father Prof Habib had good relations with Raja Saheb, but he never mentioned anything like giving land to the university. He said that as far as taking and giving land is concerned, there must be some documents of a lease. Those who have given should be having some papers. This matter is between the taker and the giver. Professor Irfan Habib said that Raja Mahendra Pratap was a student at Mohamadan Anglo Oriental College.  After that, he moved to Kabul in 1914 and after World War II, he came back to India a few days before independence in 1946. In this way, King Mahendra Pratap spent a large part of his life outside the country. Now, when the process of giving and taking land took place, he cannot say anything about it. Former Vice President of AMU Student’s Union, Mr. Nadeem Ansari said that AMU alumnus Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh has always been the pride of the university. Hundreds of students passed out from this school on their given land who have served the country and the world. This cycle will continue in the future as well. Now if their descendants are asking for this land, then once again they should think about the great man and his motive which he had thought 100 years ago. The student leader of AMU, Mohammad Shikoh said that Raja Mahendra Pratap also sacrificed his life and property to this country and society. Today their descendants are asking for accounts. Can his descendants bring back the golden years of the Raja Mahendra Pratap’s life, which he had endured away from this country? City school started in 1928   Along with the preparations to return the land of the City School ground at Banna Devi of Aligarh Muslim University to the descendants of King Mahendra Pratap, several other issues have also started. There is nearly five and a half bigha land behind the tehsil that worth crores of rupees currently. The property department of the university is engaged in an in-depth study of the provisions of the lease for this land. The city school was established in 1928 at this place where some people are estimating the lease period till 2027. University administration is engaged in studying all these.   Nehru's associate Khwaja contributed to the establishment of the school   Jawaharlal Nehru's colleague Abdul Majeed Khwaja of Aligarh, who studied with him in Cambridge, has also been played an important role in the establishment of the Aligarh Muslim University's City School in Banna Devi. The school was started by Maulana Bahadur Ali in 1889 as Anjuman-e-Islamia Primary School. In 1919, it was established as the city branch of Mohammedan Anglo Oriental College. The school was moved to the existing building at Banna Devi in 1928.   7 years ago, won the lease ownership lawsuit   7 years ago, Aligarh Muslim University had won the lawsuit in the High Court on its lease on 5 and a half bigha land of City School.

"UP Defence Corridor: Search on for land in Khyamai, Barakalan and Jalalpur","  Along with progressing the work of setting up the Defence Industrial Corridor in Andla, the UPEIDA team is also actively looking for land in Khyamai, Barakalan and Jalalpur in Gabhana. Today, two UPEIDA land officers OP Pathak and Sanjay Chawla also visited Khyamai, Barakalan and Jalalpur. 60 hectares of government land is being found in Khyamai, 20 hectares in Jalalpur and 50 hectares in Barakalan. ADM DV Pal told that land is being searched for setting up an explosive making factory. Therefore, the land is being searched in a safe and secluded place. He further stated that these three locations are good for expansion for the Defense Corridor. The land is also cheaper because it belongs to the government, so these lands are a better option for expansion. Recently, in the video conference of CM, Home Secretary Avnish Awasthi had instructed the investors to transfer the land of Andla at the earliest under their firm’s name. After this, the local administration has started the process of transferring the land. The forest department has been asked to clear the land in Andla by cutting down trees. The current circle rate of land in Khyamai is around Rs 32 lakh per hectare while the land is being sold for Rs 26 to 27 lakh per hectare. If the land is taken for the defense corridor, the farmers will get double the circle rate, that is, around Rs 64 lakh per hectare. Therefore, farmers are also excited to sell their land. Along with UPEIDA officials, Navneet Varshney, Mukesh Jain and Mohit Kumar of the Federation of Innovative Manufacturers also inspected the land and talked to the farmers. The total land of Khyamai can come up to 60 hectares in this project. Therefore, all the connectivity routes from Andla to Khyamai are being looked at, so that the connectivity can be improved. SDM Gabhana Praveen Yadav said that the information sought by the team officials is being made available to them. Andla is 7 Kms from Khyamai. There is another way from Veerpur Somna Marg, that is also being seen.  ",india
Kerala Cong braces up to celebrate Chandy’s golden jubilee,"  Though the Congress presence is not felt in the State-wide agitation against the CPI(M)-led Kerala Government over the gold smuggling scam and LIFE Mission corruption charges, the Grand Old Party is busy with warming up for a two-day mega event to be held at Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday and Saturday respectively. The fact that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are addressing the virtual rallies live from New Delhi shows the importance of being Oommen Chandi, the face of the party in Kerala. Congressmen and cadre in the State are getting ready to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of former Chief Minister Oommen Chandi’s membership of the Kerala Legislative Assembly. Chandi (75) is the only law maker in the Kerala who has been elected to the assembly in all elections he had contested since 1970. Though he was playing a subdued role in politics after the 2016 election in which the Congress-led UDF was defeated by a huge margin by the CPI(M)-led Left Front, the Congress staged an impressive return in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Kerala. The Congress High Command in a major reorganization of the party, inducted Oommen Chandi as a member of the Congress Working Committee making it clear that who would be the chief ministerial candidate of the  party in the 2021 election. It has its own explanations.  “Chandi is always the man of the hour to whom the High Command turns to in emergency times. He has the capability to disarm even hardcore critics of the party with that disarming smile. Moreover he has only obsession and that is Kerala politics,” said Sam Rajappa, a long time  observer of Kerala’s politics. Though belonging to the Christian community, Chandi is acceptable to all including Hindus in the State and that makes him the frontrunner for the chief minister’s post. “All allegations levelled against him by the CPI(M) prior to the 2016 have fallen flat. The Hindus have understood that had the Government of Kerala followed the affidavit filed by his Government in the Sabarimala Case, the unpleasant events that took place in the holy shrine would not have been there. The CPI(M) government took back that affidavit and filed another one which earned it the wrath of the people,” said P Rajan, former editor of Mathrubhumi and venerated  commentator.  In a politically surcharged State like Kerala, it is impossible to any person to win successfully and successively from a single constituency all elections. But Oommen Chandi, popularly known as Kunjoonju is different and he is here to stay for some more years, say friends and foes alike.  ",india

Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said: “We are very pleased to partner with Dr.Reddy’s in India. India is amongst most severely impacted countries from Covid-19 and we believe our human adenovirus dual vector platform will provide a safe and scientifically validated option to India in the battle against Covid-19.” GV Prasad, Co-Chairman and Managing Director of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,  said that the Phase I and II results have shown promise, and we will be conducting Phase-III trials in India to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators. “Sputnik-V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against Covid-19 in India,” he said. Meanwhile, giving its nod to the SII to start the trial, the DCGI asked the SII to submit details of medication used in accordance with the protocol for management of adverse events.

SC seeks Centre’s reply on plea challenging provisions of privacy in Special Marriage Act,"  The Supreme Court  on Wednesday sought response from the Centre on a plea which has challenged validity of some provisions of the Special Marriage Act which require two adults to put personal details in public domain for scrutiny before their wedding and they might have a “chilling effect” on the fundamental right to marry and privacy. A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde agreed to hear the petition filed by a Kerala-based law student who has claimed that some provisions of the Special Marriage Act violates the fundamental rights of couple intending to marry, depriving them of their right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.Issue notice, the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said.

The moment you delete these, the people for whose benefit it was enacted will suffer, the bench observed. The counsel appearing for petitioner Nandini Praveen referred to the apex court’s landmark verdict declaring Right to Privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution. You are saying about privacy and that the whole world comes to know about it. But look at its positive point also, the bench observed. The plea has sought striking down of sections including 6(2), 7, 8 and 10 of the Special Marriage Act as “unjust, illegal and unconstitutional”. “Publication of personal details often might have a chilling effect on the right to marry.

PM to inaugurate historic Kosi rail bridge tomorrow,"  Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate to the nation the ""historic"" Kosi rail mega bridge through video-conference on Friday and also inaugurate 12 rail projects related to passenger facilities in Bihar, his office said. Modi has either inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of a number of development projects in the poll-bound state in the last few days with sources saying that the total cost of these infrastructure and other programmes would be about Rs 16,000 crore. The Prime Minister''s Office said on Wednesday that the ''Kosi Rail Mahasetu'' (mega bridge) is a watershed moment in the history of Bihar as it will connect the region to the North East and described it as historic. In 1887, a meter gauge link was built between Nirmali and Bhaptiahi in the region but it was washed away during the heavy flood and severe Indo-Nepal earthquake in 1934, the PMO said, adding no attempt was made to restore this rail connectivity for a long period due to the meandering nature of Kosi river. The mega bridge project was sanctioned by the Union government during 2003-04. It is 1.9 km long and its construction cost is Rs 516 crore, the PMO said. ""This bridge is of strategic importance along the India-Nepal border. The project was completed during the COVID-Pandemic where the migrant labour also participated in its completion,"" it added. The 12 other rail projects, which Modi will also inaugurate, include a new railway bridge on the Kiul River, two new railway lines, five electrification projects, one electric locomotive shed and third line project between Barh and Bakhtiyarpur. The inauguration of Kosi rail mega bridge will fulfil the 86-year-old dream and a long wait of the people of the region, the PMO said. The prime minister will also flag off the Saharsa-Asanpur Kupha train from the Supaul station. Once the regular train service begins, this would prove to be highly beneficial to Supaul, Arariya and Saharsa districts, making it easier for those on long distance travel to Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai. He will also inaugurate the railway electrification projects of Muzaffarpur– Sitamarhi, Katihar–New Jalpaiguri, Samastipur-Darbhanga-Jaynagar, Samastipur-Khagaria, and Bhagalpur-Shivnarayanpur sections, the PMO said.

Maha HM orders probe into assault on Army veteran by BJP man,"  In an apparent counter to the effort by the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to politicise the alleged assault on a retired Navy man at Kandivli by some ruling Shiv Sainiks, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP on Tuesday ordered investigations against BJP MP Unmesh Patil for the alleged assault on an Army veteran Sonu Mahajan in 2016. Taking to twitter on Tuesday, Deshmukh said:  “In 2016 the BJP MLA and incumbent MP Shri Unmesh Patil and others had attacked retired Soldier Shri Sonu Mahajan. The then state BJP Government did not give justice to Shri Mahajan. I have received several applications in this matter and have ordered investigation in this matter”. “The offence was committed in 2016 but due to the State BJP Government protection to Shri Patil no FIR was filed. In 2019 on Hon'ble High Court directions a FIR was filed but no further legal action has been taken against Shri Patil and others,” Deshmukh said in another tweet. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant,  who had on Sunday alleged that the BJP MP had tried to kill Army veteran Mahajan during chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ tenure, slammed the previous BJP government for its failure to act against the BJP MP concerned. “In 2016, under the Devendra Fadnavis govt, an attempt to murder Army veteran Sonu Mahajan was made on orders of the then BJP MLA and noiw MP Unmesh Patil. The family had to approach the High Court to even get a case registered. To date, no action has been taken by the BJP against its own MP,” Sawant tweeted. Thanking the current MVA government for ordering investigation into the delay in acting against BJPMP Unmesh Patil, Sawant tweeted: “Instead of punishing BJP MP & others who attacked our army veteran, Fadnavis govt persecuted him by putting him in jail as well as externing him. Even after HC direction, no action was taken. MVA govt & @anildeshmukhncp have given Sonu Mahajan ji justice #JusticeForSonuMahajan”.  ",india
Govt taking all necessary steps to prevent spread of virus: Vardhan,"  Amid the gradual opening up of the economy and consequent rise in Covid-19 cases, the Government on Tuesday told Parliament that the battle against the virulent virus is far from over but asserted that the lockdown from March 25 to May 31 successfully controlled the aggressive progression of the disease. At the same time, it admitted that there has been a steady rise in the number of cases in the post-lockdown phase. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Vardhan said that the government is taking all necessary measures to prevent the spread of the disease. “It is important that sustained community support is ensured to control the spread of the virus and break its chain of transmission.”  “We are in the stage of unlocking to revive the economy and it’s important that sustained community support is ensured consistently to control the spread of COVID-19 infection and break its chain of transmission,’’ he said. “I want to remind the members that the battle against Covid-19 is far from over. I wish to inform the house that the government is taking all necessary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in India,” said Vardhan. He also said that India has been able to limit its cases and deaths per million to 3,320 and 55 respectively, which is one of the lowest in the world. “Covid-19 testing is about 1 million tests per day which translates to 720 tests per million population per day, much higher than that stipulated by WHO which 140 tests per million per day. A total of 5,51,89,226 samples were tested as of September 11,” the health minister said. His remarks come on a day when India’s Covid-19 tally inched closer to the five million-mark.

"7 activists re-arrested, released on bail","  Seven persons involved in Friday’s assault on a retired petty Navy officer at Kandivli in north-Mumbai were re-arrested by the Samata Nagar police here on an added charge of trespass, but were released on bail against a personal bond of Rs 15,000 each. The seven Shiv Sainiks-- Shiv Sena Shakha Pramukh Kamlesh Kadam and five of their associates Sanjay Manjre, Rakesh Belnekar,  Pratap Sund Vera, Sunil Desai and Rakesh Mulik who had been arrested and later released on bail on Saturday in connection with the incident – were re-arrested on Monday night, after the Samata Nagar police invoked section 452 ( House trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful confinement of  IPC. The invocation of section 452 of IPC and subsequent arrests of the six Sainiks had come after wide-spread criticism of the Kandivli police for allegedly dealing with the ruling Sena activists with kid gloves. The six arrested Shiv Sainiks were on Tuesday afternoon produced before a  Borivali Magistrate’s Court which remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. However, the lawyer for the accused subsequently moved a bail pleas before the same court which released them on a bail against a personal bond for Rs 15,000 each. It may be recalled that 65-year-old Madan Sharma, who is a retired chief petty officer in the Navy, was attacked by a group of Shiv Sainiks, led by a party shakha pramukh on Friday last after he reportedly forwarded in his building group a cartoon that projected chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a poor light. Sharma is a member of the housing society at Kandivli in north Mumbai.  On Wednesday, Sharma had forwarded a cartoon showing Uddhav prostrating before pictures of NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress President Sonia Gandhi in a WhatsApp group of his housing society. He had seen that cartoon in another WhatsApp group earlier. According to Sharma’s daughter Dr Sheela Sharma, one of the members of their housing society group had alerted Kadam about the “objectionable” cartoon   On Friday, a group of eight to ten Shiv Sainiks came to his housing society and assaulted Sharma. Later, CCTV footage posted on Twitter by BJP  MLA from Kandivli (east) Atul Bhatkhalkar showed a group of men chasing after Sharma and dragging him outside the society premises by his shirt collar. The footage, which went viral, also showed the men slapping Sharma and pulling at his shirt even as the society’s security guards remained silent spectators. Later on Friday evening, Sharma lodged a complaint with the Samta Nagar police station against Kadam and other Shiv Sainiks. Apart from demanding stern action against the Shiv Sainiks behind the incident, Sharma’s daughter Dr Sheela Sharma has rooted for the imposition of President's Rule in Maharashtra, citing that nobody was safe in the state A day after the incident, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to the victim, made enquiries about his health  and condemned the incident. Singh said that such attacks on ex-servicemen “were completely unacceptable and deplorable”.     “Spoke to retired naval officer, Shri Madan Sharma who was attacked by hooligans in Mumbai and enquired about his health. Such attacks on Ex-Servicemen are completely unacceptable and deplorable. I wish Madanji a speedy recovery,” Rajnath had tweeted. Subsequently on Sunday, Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale on Sunday met the victim Navy man, enquired about his health and rooted for imposition of President’s rule in Maharashtra, even as actress Kangana called on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and sought justice for her.

Pandemic-hit Pune sex workers look for other livelihood,"  With no money to eke their living, 99 per cent 3000-odd “out of work” Covid 19- hit commercial sex workers (CSWs) from Pune’s infamous Budhwar red-light area have made up  their mind to quit their profession and are looking alternative livelihood options, according NGO Asha Care Trust. Over the period of lockdown, the demand for sex work has dried down forcing sex workers to borrow loans for survival. The findings of a survey conducted by Asha Care Trust, a forum that works towards the welfare of sex workers, reveal that 85 per cent of the workers have taken loans and over 98% of them have taken it from their brothel owners, managers and moneylenders, subjecting themselves to further exploitation. Budhwar Peth is India’s third-largest red-light area which nearly houses 700 brothels and around 3,000 commercial sex workers. A study of 300 (around 10 per cent) commercial sex workers in Budhwar Peth was conducted during the survey. Nearly 87 per cent of workers stated that even before the pandemic struck, their incomes were not sufficient to support themselves or their families. Key factors like lack of education and employable skills compel them to depend on one source of income i.e. earning through flesh trade and remain trapped in the vicious circle. Majority of the workers now want to explore alternative sources of livelihood and get away from flesh trade. Some of key findings in the survey are:  82 per cent of the workers fall in the age group of 25 to 45 years. Some of them were forced into the trade when they were a minor; 84 per cent of the sex workers have not had any formal education and the rest 16% were pushed into the flesh trade even before they finished high school; 92.7 per cent stated that they fear resuming sex work but are also crippled with the fear of starvation; harassment from brothel managers has led them to worry about their daily bread and butter. While 68 per cent believe that the sex trade will pick up in the days to come, 99 per cent stated that they will take up any alternative livelihood option if given an opportunity. “COVID-19 epidemic has presented us with an opportunity to create a mechanism to rehabilitate  sex workers in mainstream society. Our survey suggests almost all of them are looking at alternative sources of livelihood in Budhwar Peth region. For the women who opt-out of sex trade, trafficking victim relief fund should be provided to help them pay-off their debt and get started with a new chapter,”  Ms. Sheela Shetty, president of Asha Care Trust said. Among other things, the survey recommends that that the district and the State administrations can launch basic skill training programs under the National Urban Livelihood Mission for up-skilling women in areas like tailoring, data entry, tele-calling, sales and marketing, packaging, entrepreneurship training, working with NGOs. On its part, Freedom Firm, a local NGO that works in the area has extended its support the initiative for creating alternative job opportunities for the Commercial sex workers.  “This initiative is a positive thing. The red light area in Pune, consists of 500+ brothels which could not have been evolved over night. It is high time that the authorities and NGOs should view this unprecedented time as an opportunity to act quickly for providing alternative livelihood to sex workers who have faced a lot hardships already. I hope this initiative gets support from the government and NGOs as well and brings lasting impact,” an office bearer of Freedom forum said. A delegation led by Asha Care Trust along with representatives of other organisations like Shailesh Badhai from Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samiti, Yogesh Bhokre of Maharashtra Itak Kamgar Sangathana, social worker Pratibha Shinde, Fayyaz sheikh of Pune Jilha Grahak Sanrakshan Samiti, Bhola Vanjale and Advocate Vidya Pedankar met the Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, and submitted the report. Ms Shetty said that the delegation also requested quick action supporting the findings of the study. “The meeting was very good and the Hon’ble Mayor gave us a very positive response on this. We are very hopeful that the district administration will help us in this regard,” she added.  ",india
"Flood forecasting, its efficacy should be evaluated by independent expert: RS panel","  Rajya Sabha’s Committee on Petitions has recommended that the country’s entire flood forecasting network and its overall efficacy should be evaluated by an independent, third party expert. The Committee also recommended building of more flood forecasting stations, especially in States and adoption of latest technology being used in other countries to forecast floods accurately. The Committee, headed by Prasanna Acharya, tabled its report in the Upper House, on the petition moved by Prof Raj Kachroo, a resident of Gurugram, Haryana ‘praying for development of capacity to make real time forecasting of floods so as to issue timely warning to the affected people’. The panel recommended both the Centre and the State government to bring an immediate end to illegal construction activities and vegetation on flood plains across the country. The Committee has asked the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to encourage C-DAC to specifically develop supercomputer for flood forecasting system and implement 2D/3D distributed model on a very fine resolution grid for better prediction thereby increasing data size. The Committee further recommends that the latest forecasting techniques presently being used by the other countries are required to be studied and a suitable method required to be adopted for purpose of the forecast The petition highlights the issues of negligence and inattention on parts of the Ministry of Jal Shakti (erstwhile Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation) and Ministry of Science and Technology in developing capacity for real time forecasting of floods and management of reservoirs, lack of any significant effort made by the Central Water Commission (CWC) in developing real time flood forecasting, exigency of developing the required expertise and capacity at home by roping in Universities across the country, and necessity of having legislation on Dam Safety. Calling for evaluation of the entire flood forecasting network, the Committee recommended resolving the shortcomings.  ",india

"Fake news triggered unexpected movement of migrants during lockdown, Parliament told","  The Union Home Ministry on Tuesday told Parliament that unexpected movement of large number of migrant workers during lockdown was triggered by panic created by fake news. “The migration of a large number of migrant workers was triggered by panic created by fake news regarding the duration of lockdown.

House nod to Bill for statutory status to aviation regulators,"  Rajya Sabha on Tuesday passed ‘The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill, 2020’ providing for statutory backing to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and entailing increasing the fine for violations from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1crore. The Bill was passed by a voice vote after an hour-long discussion. The legislation had already been cleared by the Lok Sabha in March this year. Under the new Act (after its implementation), any violation will attract heavy punishment, for example, violators will be punished up to two years in jail or fine up to Rs 10 lakh or both. Carrying arms, ammunition, and explosives or other banned goods on board, and developing illegal construction around the airports will attract fines up to Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 1 crore. Replying to the debate, Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said that the Government in the last three years has recruited 1,000 air traffic controllers as against requirement of 3,500 such officials. “India is the third largest market globally after the United States and China, and India is growing rapidly in the aviation sector, in terms of passengers’ growth and aircraft in the skies ,” he said. Earlier, opposition parties had opposed the Bill, and Congress’ Rajyasabha MP KC Venugopal raised concern over “many vacancies in the aviation industry”. He also pointed out to the near-misses of the aircraft in the skies for last many years. Former Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel said that airlines are financially stressed due to COVID-19 and need support from the government. Stating the importance of civil aviation sector in the country, he said: “Four to five per cent people of the country board flights one time in a year. If this number goes up to 10-15 per cent, we would need a huge increase in the number of airports and aircraft.” Replying to issues raised by Congress member, Puri said Venugopal should look at the issue of privatisation in a historical context. The country’s largest airports Delhi and Mumbai were successfully privatised in 2006 under a previous political dispensation, and proceeds from the process have resulted in getting resources to develop airport infrastructure in the country, he noted. Since the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports, the Airports Authority of India has received Rs 29,000 crore, Puri said. On the Congress’ charge of allotting six airports to one group, Puri said the Delhi and Mumbai airports account for 33 percent of air traffic and earnings. The six airports that were awarded in 2018 together account for only nine per cent of traffic and earnings, he said. On Air India’s privatisation, he said, “If I could help it, we would keep it, but with Rs 60,000 crore debt, the choice is not between privatisation and not privatisation. Some of my colleagues should realise that the choice is between privatisation and closing down.”  ",india
"LS passes Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020","  Amid Opposition’s reservations about the possible entry of corporate houses, the Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed amendments to the Essential Commodities Act and a Bill mooting 30 per cent salary cuts for MPs in the wake of economic constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the MPs supported the salary cut, a majority of them demanded the restoration of the MPLADS funds citing its need for the development in their respective constituencies. BJP ally Akali Dal urged the Government to clear the doubts in the minds of farmers  on many points mentioned in the amendments to the Essential Commodities Act.  Akali Dal’s Sukhbir Singh Badal questioned the manner in which the ordinance was brought without having any consultation with farmers’ organisations. “The most affected are the farmers from Punjab. The farmers want clarification of their doubts; they fear that the multinationals will initially offer lucrative deals and then dominate the market,” said Badal. Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said there are a lot of ambiguities in the amendments and this would open up the entry of big industries to enter into the stock holding and distribution of agriculture products. “This is a way to make hoarders ‘Atmanirbhar’,” he said in a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for becoming self-reliant. “The hoarders can create multiple entities to stock commodities. It is a highly centralised law. Under the law, licences are not required for purchasing produces. Why does this government rely all the time on the ordinance route? What was the link between the ordinance and the pandemic, the Government should explain,” added Chowdhury. Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Raosaheb Patil Danve said: “The 1955 Act was brought at a time when we faced food scarcity, now we have surplus agriculture production. In order to reduce the losses, we should have food processing units, due to non availability of cold storages, farmers suffer losses. The proposed amendment will encourage competition and it will help farmers get fair price for their produces. The consumers will also benefit.” he said. Supporting the amendments, Bhartruhari Mahtab from BJD, said there was a need to remove many restrictions in trade of agricultural commodities. “This reform will improve agricultural production, the Government should have done away with restriction on exports. We are self sufficient in food grains, we can counter China’s loan diplomacy with food diplomacy,” he said. Earlier, Lok Sabha passed the bill reducing MPs’ salary by 30%. “The Government has taken unprecedented measures to tackle Covid-19. `20 lakh crore had been allocated as Covid-19 package,” said Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi justifying the salary cuts. However, majority of the MPs urged the Government to restore the MPLADS funds for the development of local areas. “Almost 80% of the fund is spent in rural areas; why are you taking away the funds meant to be spent on Scheduled Castes.

92% Covid patients diagnosed with mild complications,"  In India, 92 per cent of Covid-19 patients got only a mild form of the disease while about 5.8 per cent patients required oxygen therapy and 1.7 per cent needed intensive care, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan told the Lok Sabha Monday on the opening day of the Monsoon Session. While claiming that the 24 March decision to impose the harshest lockdown in the world prevented 14-29 lakh cases and 37,000-78,000 deaths, the Minister said that around 13 states in the country are reporting the maximum number of coronavirus cases on daily basis. Even as on Monday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India stood at 48,46,427 with 79,722 deaths, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that the country has now moved from ‘managing travel-related cases’ to containing clusters and large outbreaks due to local transmission to wide spread of infection to urban, peri-urban and rural areas. “This would require concerted effort by the Government with people’s participation to prevent large scale morbidity and mortality,” he added. “Many of the epidemiological parameters such as mode of transmission, subclinical infection, period of virus shedding, role of immunity etc. are still being researched. Once a person is exposed to the infection, the disease may develop anytime between 1 and 14 days. The main symptoms of Covid are fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing,” the Minister told the House. Dr Harsh Vardhan also said expenditure finance memorandum of Rs 65,560.98 crore under the Prime Minister Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana for strengthening the health sector is under consideration. This includes investment in research, healthcare and public health infrastructure, with particular focus on pandemic management. The health minister told MPs that 13 clinical trials of repurposed drugs and harnessing of traditional knowledge using the modern medicine approach are building a portfolio of therapeutic options for Covid-19 patients. “Phase 2 clinical trial of immunomodulator Sepsivac has been completed successfully. Phase 2 clinical trial of the first-ever phytopharmaceutical ACQH is under way. One prophylactic trial of Aswagandha and three trials of Guduchi + Pippali; Yashtimadhu; and polyherbal AYUSH drug (AYUSH-64) are planned on moderately ill Covid-19 patients,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said. “Globally, there are around 145 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation and currently 35 vaccines in clinical trial. In India, a major focus has been on facilitating the development of Covid-19 vaccine. More than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development, 3 candidates are in advanced stage of Phase I/II/III trials and more than 4 are in advanced pre-clinical development stage,” he said. The Covid-19 Bio-repositories have collected more than 40,000 samples for use by researchers developing diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The health minister also spoke about the shift in focus from only Covid to other non-Covid diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, which ended up being partially neglected during the lockdown. “Equally crucial is to maintain the success achieved in management of reproductive maternal and child health, vaccine preventable diseases, non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis, vector borne diseases such as Kala Azar and Malaria. Hence, there is an increased thrust for managing non-Covid essential services,” the minister said.  ",india

"Bills on farmers’ income, co-op banks under RBI introduced","  Amid stiff protest from the Opposition, which accused the Centre of “encroaching” on State subjects, the Government on Monday introduced bills on price assurance to farmers and regulation of co-operative banks by RBI in the Lok Sabha. Defending the two bills on the farm sector, Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said they will help the farmers get a remunerative price for their produce as well as private investments and technology. Responding to the charges of Opposition, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the regulation bill is intended to protect the depositors in co-operative banks and nothing to intervene on the state’s acts related to the banks. Leader of Congress Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and TMC leader Saugata Roy accused the Centre of intervening in Agriculture which is a State Subject. Many Opposition MPs pointed out the ongoing agitations of farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh against the bill. Chowdhury said that these bills are not mentioning about the current system of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and is aimed at business houses’ entry in the agriculture sector. The Opposition has alleged that the Centre brought in the legislations without consulting the states under whose domain 'agriculture' and 'mandis' come. ""Such a law can only be brought by State Governments.  Through this bill, the centre will nullify Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) law enacted by various state governments,"" Chowdhury said. Agriculture Minister  Tomar, while introducing the bills to replace the 'The Farmers' Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 and 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, said that almost 86 per cent of farmers have agricultural land of less than two hectares and they are often unable to benefit from minimum support price (MSPs). To specific questions raised by MPs, Minister assured the House that the MSP will stay. The ordinances seek to provide barrier-free trade for farmers' produce outside notified farm mandis, and empower farmers to enter into farming agreements with private players prior to the production for sale of agri-produce, said Tomar. He said the bill will help the farmers as they are unable to invest much in their farm and do not attract investments from others. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ""It is beyond the legislative competence of this house to enact any law on agriculture, which is a domain of the state governments.” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi objected to his remarks that the bills violated the basic tenets of federalism enshrined in India's Constitution. Responding to volley of objections on the new banking regulation bill which bring co-operative banks under RBI supervision, Sitharaman detailed the bad financial position of many co-operative banks and she said the bill is focusing on protection of the depositors. The new Bill — The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2020 — to protect the depositors of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and Multi State Cooperative Banks (MSCBs) and not interfering into the State Laws, she said.

Parliament’s green signal to two medical education system Bills,"  Parliament on Monday gave the green signal to two bills that propose a medical education system aiming to improve access to quality and affordable medical education by ensuring availability of adequate and high quality homoeopathy and Indian system of medicine professionals across the country. Cleared by the Rajya Sabha in 2019, the Lok Sabha paved the way for passage of the National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill and the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill. The National Commission for Homoeopathy, Bill, 2018, aims to replace the Central Council for Homoeopathy, which is the current regulatory body for homoeopathy. It proposes a teacher’s eligibility test to assess the standard of teachers before appointment and promotions. The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill bill will replace the Central Council for Indian Medicine that regulates alternative systems of medicine and has provision for constituting autonomous boards for providing Ayurveda education among others.  With the nod from the  lower house,  the two proposed legislations mean that they are set to become laws after getting formal approval from President Ram Nath Kovind. Some opposition members protested against the bill, saying the Centre needed to undertake wider consultation. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the proposed laws will help in better administration of homeopathy and Indian system of medicines. The proposed legislations promote equitable and universal healthcare that encourages community health perspective and make services of such medical professionals accessible to all citizens, the government has said. They promote national health goals, encourage medical professionals to adopt the latest medical research in their work and to contribute to research with an objective, periodic and transparent assessment of medical institutions.  The bills facilitate maintenance of a medical register of homeopathy and Indian system of medicine and enforce high ethical standards in all aspects of medical services.  ",india
Parliament must send message country stands by soldiers: PM,"  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday hoped that Parliament will send out a unanimous and strong message to soldiers on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) facing Chinese aggression  that the country was solidly standing behind its bravehearts. Modi, who was talking to newspersons in the Parliament premises on the opening day of the Monsoon session, asserted that sending an unambiguous message was “legislature’s crucial responsibility”. The Congress moved an adjournment motion on the border face-off and sought the government to detail the status on the  LAC. The opposition also wants a discussion on the issue. The Congress attempted to raise the issue but could not proceed with it in the Lok Sabha. Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and party leader K Suresh gave adjournment notices over the issue of Chinese incursion in Eastern Ladakh. India and China have been engaged in a standoff since April-May over the transgressions by the Chinese Army in multiple areas on the LAC. The Lok Sabha was adjourned for an hour, shortly after it met, on Monday following obituary references and offering tributes to former members. The Prime Minister stated categorically that the parliamentarians will send out a message of their unequivocal support to brave ‘jawans’ facing hardships on the border. “The entire Parliament stands with the brave soldiers of the country with one voice. I believe that Parliament and all its members will give out a very strong message”, the Prime Minister said before the start of the session. He also mentioned that the situations are set to become tougher due to the onset of winters that marks heavy snowfall on the border area. “This Parliament, particularly in this session, has one more crucial responsibility .. just like the faith with which they (soldiers) are standing , determined to protect motherland , Parliament and all its members too will send out a message in unanimous voice, spirit  and resolve that the country stands in support of them,” Modi said. ""In one voice, one pledge and one feeling, we will send out a message to the soldiers that we are with them,"" the Prime Minister said.  Reacting to  Modi’s Rs expectationsRs   from the opposition, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was quoted by a news agency as saying , ""There is no doubt that all of us stand with the soldiers. However, the government should tell Parliament what is the situation on the border."" The Prime Minister had in the first all party meeting after the ‘Galwan’ clash on June 15  between Indian army and Chinese soldiers, trying to sneak in Indian territory in East of Ladakh, maintained that there was no incursion in the  Indian side of the LAC. The Congress-led opposition wants government to clarify in the light of demands that China restore the status quo ante on the LAC. Modi also expressed gratitude towards the parliamentarians for choosing duty over Covid-19. "" I congratulate and thank them (MPs) for choosing duty over Covid-19 threat. Because of this, the budget session was curtailed and this session we have change of timings for both houses. In fact, Saturdays and Sundays are also working days. There would be many important issues that will be discussed. The more we debate and make it vibrant and detailed, more fruitful it will be for the country and parliament,"" he said. Modi reiterated his caution in the pandemic situation and asked everyone to be careful and  be safe. ""Jab tak dawai nahi, tab tak dhilai Nahi. (No carelessness till there is a vaccine). Hope we will be able to relieve the world of this misery,"" the Prime Minister said.  ",india
"Kangana links Aditya Thackeray to movie mafia, murderers of SSR, drug racket","  Maintaining that her earlier analogy of Mumbai  being “Pak-Occupied Kashmir” (POK) was “bang on”, outspoken actress Kangana Ranaut on Monday took Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray head-on once again, by linking the latter’s Minister-son Aaditya Thackeray to “movie mafia, murderers of SSR and its (sic) drug racket”. Hours after she departed from Mumbai for her home state of Himachal Pradesh, Kangana virtually indulged in slander, when she tweeted: “Basic problem of Maharashtra CM is why I exposed movie mafia, murderers of SSR and its(sic) drug racket, who his beloved son Aaditya Thakeray hangs out with, this is my big crime so now they want to fix me, ok try let’s see who fixes who!!!” Earlier in the day when she was about to fly out of Mumbai, Kangana came up with a nasty parting tweet: “With a heavy heart leaving Mumbai, the way I was terrorised all these days constant attacks and abuses hurled at me attempts to break my house after my work place, alert security with lethal weapons around me, must say my analogy about POK was bang on”. Kangana -- who had arrived in Mumbai from her home town of Manali on Wednesday in the immediate wake of partial demolition of her Pali Hill bungalow by the Brihnanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – hit out at the ruling Shiv Sena and Congress.  “It seems this time I was saved. There was a time when I felt a mother's touch in Mumbai, but today the situation is such that I am lucky to be alive. The moment Shiv Sena became Sonia Sena, the Mumbai administration became a terror,” she posted in Hindi, targeting the Sena as well as Congress president Sonia Gandhi, “ Kangana tweeted in Hindi while she was en route to her hometown. Later in the evening, her team tweeted: “ Thank you Facebook free speech must be protected in a democracy, people need to be protected from Sonia Sena goons much like COVID -19 virus, thank you for being considerate, well done”. Kangana has come under fire from various quarters for controversial statements comparing Mumbai to “Pak-Occupied Kashmir” and saying “it seems Mumbai is addicted to blood” and dubbing Bollywood as an 'Islam-dominated' film industry. There have also been protests erupted in Mumbai and other cities against the actress. Through a series of tweets put out during and after the BMC workers demolished her office at Bandra’s Pali Hill area in north-west Mumbai on Wednesday last, Kangana had among other things come up with a “..... tujhe kya lagta hai?”  dare for Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, whom she had threatened to expose.    It may be recalled that referring to Uddhav Thackeray as “tujhe”, Kangana had on September 9 launched an all out war against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.  “Uddhav Thackeray, tujhe kya lagta hai? (what do you think?)… colluded along with the film mafia, demolished my home and took revenge on me? My home was demolished today, your arrogance will crumble tomorrow,” Kangana had said in a video message on her arrival in Mumbai.       Meanwhile, Maharashtra Transport Minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab said that Kangana had a “dual personality disorder” and she needed  to see a doctor and said if she felt Mumbai “is POK” she should shift out of Mumbai and live wherever she wanted. Talking to media persons, Parab charged that “She clearly has a dual personality (disorder). She needs a doctor. Kangana is an actor and speaks according to the script given to her. Many such Kangana’s have come and gone”. Alluding to her much-discussed visit to Maharashtra to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Parab said: “Why should the Governor meet only Kangana? He should also meet the poor people whose illegal slums or roadside constructions are being demolished regularly”. Parab had a dig at the Opposition BJP, wondering as to its “stomach was churning” when Kangana’s illegal structures were pulled down. Stressing that the Shiv Sena would not tolerate if “she crosses limits and makes any wild statements about Mumbai or Maharashtra”, Parab said: “We are within our limits. They should also observe the limits. We will not keep quiet if she keeps talking ill about Mumbai. She has to decide what she wants to do. Maharashtra will decide what it has to do. If she thinks the city is like POK, then she must shift from here and live wherever she wants”.  ",india

Allowed to share GPay customer transaction info with third parties with NPCI permission,"  Google India Digital Services Pvt. Ltd., which operates the GPay app, has told the Delhi High Court that it is allowed to share customers transaction data with third parties with the prior permission of NPCI and payment service provider (PSP) banks. The submission has been made by Google in its affidavit filed before a Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan in response to a PIL seeking action against ‘Google Pay’ (GPay) for allegedly violating the RBI’s guidelines related to data localisation, storage and sharing. The High Court on September 24 listed the matter for hearing on November 10 as the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have not filed their responses yet. Google, in its affidavit, has contended that under the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) procedural guidelines, issued by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), apps like GPay are permitted to share customers transaction data with third parties and group companies with prior permission of NPCI and PSP banks. It has also said that GPay only stores ordinary customer data — like name, address, email ID and transaction related details — in accordance with the NPCI guidelines and not payment sensitive data like debit card number or UPI PIN.

Mkt tanks on slow eco recovery fear,"  Dangers to an overall international economic recovery such as rising Covid-19 cases, along with possible reimposition of lockdown measures in some European countries, pushed the global and the Indian stock markets deep into the red on Thursday, with the BSE Sensex losing 1,100 points, its worst performance in six months. Besides, no new stimulus measures for the US, combined with a slower growth forecast for the world’s largest economy, also impacted global sentiments. Not just equities, but crude oil and precious metal prices fell, leading to a chaos across asset classes.However, the US dollar made the most of the bloodbath.The domino effect of such massive downside resulted in the Indian stock markets witnessing a gap-down opening on Thursday.The BSE Sensex lost 1,100 points and the NSE Nifty50 fell well below the psychological 11,000 mark. Post Thursday’s selloff, Sensex lost 2,292 points in the last four sessions. This was the sixth consecutive session of loss for the Indian indices, as well as the biggest single day fall for the BSE Sensex in four months and the biggest losing streak (6 sessions) in seven months. The Nifty50 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) fell well below the psychological 11,000 mark. The recent bear run has been due to resurgence in coronavirus cases across the world, largely in Europe, and anticipation of fresh lockdown restrictions across several countries of the continent, including the UK and France. The BSE Sensex closed at 36,553.60, lower by 1,114.82 points, or 2.96 per cent, from the previous close of 37,668.42.

Manish Hathiramani, technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments, said: “The support level of 10,900-10,950 has been disrespected during today’s trading session. We have also pierced 10,882 which was made on August 3, 2020. This opens a new target of 10,750. Any bounce can be utilised to short the Nifty for this target.” Among the sectors, auto, banking, metal and IT indices lost the most. “European stocks and Asian stocks dropped following a rout in tech shares in the US on Wednesday and as investors have largely given up on the idea that the US Congress will provide a new stimulus, while worrying about a recent rise in Covid-19 cases,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities. “Economists at Goldman Sachs cut their US growth forecast for the fourth quarter in half, to 3 from 6 per cent. Investors are bombarded by a perfect storm of problems including rising virus infections, new lockdowns, a slowing economic recovery, stalled US stimulus talks and election uncertainty. Investors also fretted that a second wave of coronavirus cases during the northern hemisphere’s coming winter will derail the economic recovery.” According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services: “Indian benchmark indices had a gap down opening and kept losing ground as the day wore on, to finally end the day around 2.8 per cent down. Markets tracked weak global cues as the uncertainty witnessed in the last few days gave way to negativity, with broader markets also underperforming.””The uncertainty regarding an economic recovery, the unabated rise in virus infections, and today being derivatives expiry day, all contributed to the negativity. With volatility expected to be high, traders are advised to remain cautious.”  ",business

As the Council is likely to adopt the compensation formula suggested by t he Centre in the difficult year of Covid-19 pandemic, sources said it may also decide how long compensation cess levy should be extended to clear all dues to states. “A two-year extension of cess is the most likely outcome of the Council cil meeting scheduled on October 5. However, the council may decide to adopt compensation formula for FY21 in the next meeting and defer decision on cess extension till a more appropriate study of the issue is done,” sources quoted earlier said. Under the existing GST Act compensation for shortfall in GST collection over an agreed formula is payable by the centre for the first five years of the operations of new tax system from July 2017 to June 2022. This is paid through collection made on account of cess levy on certain goods and services. The term of the cess is co-terminus with compensation liability with the Centre. So, the Council should withdraw cess also after completion of five years. But with Covid presenting different challenge before the governments and h as lead to states bleeding over GST collections, the compensation needs of the Centre has grown manifold. As cess could not cover this high level of compensation needs this year and may be next year, there is talk of extending the levy of cess beyond June 2022. As per the Centre’s projection, the total amount expected to be collected from Compensation cess would be to the tune of Rs 65,000 crore in fy21 while total compensation payable to all states and union territories may be to the tune of Rs 3,00,000 crore. So there is a total shortfall of Rs 2,35,000 crore expected this year. The Centre wants this shortfall be met through extra borrowings under special dispensation by the states while their dues get settled after June 2022 by extending the compensation cess levy.

60% Indian retailers expect 25% festive season sales cut: Survey,"  Amid a surge in online shopping due to Covid-19, about 60 per cent retail organisations in India have seen their forecasts for the festive season go down 25 per cent or more compared to last year, says a new survey on Tuesday. Given that festival season sales account for a significant portion of sales book each year, a downturn in the festival season sales would mean a longer road to recovery, said the report by BluePi Consulting. While negative festive forecasts are pronounced in the apparel retail forecasts, 57 per cent of non-apparel retailers are interestingly optimistic about no or little change in the festive season sales. Due to the reduction in the festive season forecasts, around 71 per cent of the respondents are considering cancelling or deferring orders, showed the findings, adding that this reduction in forecast puts back the pressure on the entire supply chain, including the suppliers, vendors, manufacturers and other ancillaries. “There is no shortage of challenges as underlined in the report, and a collaborative public-private model is the need of the hour,” Pronam Chatterjee, CEO at BluePi, said in a statement. Nearly 60 per cent of the retail sector companies are actively looking for capital infusion, according to the “Retail Thought Leadership Survey Report 2020.”  ",business
Liquor makers urge Bengal CM not to alter tax structure,"  Manufacturers of alcoholic Beverages have urged West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee not to alter the existing structure of tax on liquor before the festive seasons as it will hit the market. In a joint representation to the chief minister, two major liquor makers’ associations -- Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) and International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI) -- have said if the current tax structure is changed before pujas, it would prove “counterproductive” for both the government and the industry. The state Government had imposed a 30 per cent sales tax on liquor causing “a deep slide in sales and thus hurting the government exchequer”, they said.  ",business
‘Labour reforms intend to put India among top 10 nations in ease of doing business’,"  The Government aims to catapult India to among the top 10 countries in World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings with the comprehensive labour reforms which are likely to be completed after Parliament approves three draft codes in the ongoing session, a senior official said on Tuesday.   Under the labour reforms, the Centre plans to subsume 44 central laws into four broad codes on wages; industrial relations; occupational safety, health and working conditions (OSH) and social security.  The Wage Code Bill 2019 was passed by Parliament last year, while the other three codes were introduced in the Lok Sabha on Saturday. These bill are listed for consideration and passage in the Lower House on Tuesday.  “The ultimate goal of the government is to see India figure in top 10 nations in ease of doing business index of World Bank with completion of long-pending labour reforms,” a senior labour ministry official told PTI.  As per the ‘Doing Business’ 2020 report, India had jumped 14 places to the 63rd position in the ease of doing business rankings. India has improved its rank by 79 positions in five years (2014-19).  “Labour laws would act as catalyst after the reform process is completed with passage of remaining three codes in Parliament during the ongoing session. They would be help in attracting investments and generate employment in the country,” the official added.  “At present, it is cumbersome to be an entrepreneur due to this vicious web of labour laws which make compliance practically difficult. It is easy to seek employment rather doing own business and becoming a job creator,” the official noted. The codes provide for ‘one labour return, one licence and one registration’ to smoothen compliance.  At present, an entrepreneur has to maintain eight registrations and four licences to run a business under the existing labour laws. Besides, they have to file eight labour returns, including to the EPFO, ESIC and Chief Labour Commissioner.  The government is also contemplating to digitise the entire process of labour law compliance, which will ease the process for entrepreneurs.  Under these codes, the maximum punishment for offences has been reduced to three years from seven years earlier.  Besides, the workers would benefit by getting 50 per cent of penalty imposed by courts on employers. That would be in addition to the compensation awarded by the court to them.    ",business
Sensex down 300 points on lockdown fears across Europe,"  The Indian stock market continued its dip on Tuesday, in line with the global markets as resurgence in coronavirus cases have increased possibilities of fresh lockdown restrictions across Europe, including the UK. The across-the-board sell off in the Indian market was led by oil and gas, energy, auto, banking and finance stocks. “Sensex and Nifty continued to be in correction mode by closing down by 300 points and 97 points, respectively, due to a spike in covid cases in Europe,” Keshav Lahoti, Associate Equity Analyst, Angel Broking Ltd, said. BSE Sensex closed at 37,734.08, lower by 300.06 points, or 0.79 per cent, from the previous close of 38,034.14.

Nifty could go down to 10,950-11,000 and if we don’t halt there, we could fall further to test 10,800. The resistance on the upside is 10,600-10,650 and till we do not cross that, a sell on every rise would be the appropriate strategy to adopt.” The small and midcap indices also witnessed a selloff on Tuesday. The BSE MidCap index closed 1.70 per cent lower and the BSE SmallCap was down 1.61 per cent.  ",business
No clamour or rush for restructuring of loan: SBI Chairman,"  Contrary to market expectations, there was not too much demand or clamour for restructuring of loans as permitted by RBI recently to beat the COVID-19 related stress, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said. He expects not more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth loans would avail restructuring benefit even though people have projected it to be around Rs 8 lakh crore. ""On the banking side, what I am saying, there is not too many demand. It may be contrary to what the public discourse is. Reasons could be many. One is lot of clean-up has already happened and lot of deleveraging done. More than the banks, corporates themselves are reluctant to carry the tag of restructuring. That is the feeling I am getting,"" he said. In such a scenario, he said, the need for restructuring would be more from the lower end of large corporates and upper end of MSMEs. The segment above Rs 25 crore and less than Rs 400 crore would be coming for restructuring, he said, adding not many have shown interest as on date. ""The problem with me is that I am always more optimistic. That is where I have to be more careful because people will say this man does not know his job. We are saying Rs 8 lakh crore restructuring he is saying not more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore restructuring. So there is a wide variance. What we have found is that there is no clamour or rush for restructuring,"" he said. The RBI last month permitted one-time restructuring of both corporate and retail loans without getting classified as a non-performing asset (NPA). Restructuring benefit can be availed by those whose account was standard on March 1 and defaults should not be over 30 days. The central bank also laid out some norms for implementation of a resolution plan which included eligibility of only special mention accounts 0 (SMA-0) borrowers as on March 1, 2020, independent credit assessment (ICA), higher provision among others. SMA 0 accounts are those where interest and principal payment is overdue for 1-30 days. Emphasising that infrastructure is going to be a critical area for revival of growth, Kumar said, there is an investment pipeline of Rs 110 lakh crore over 5 years. The banking sector will have the responsibility to do the intermediation between the savers and borrowers, he said. ""The long-term high growth would depend on how much capex, how much investment we put in creating the fixed assets. We have huge infrastructure deficit…demand is insatiable. Banking system is ready to fulfil that responsibility. Without a sound financial system and banking system, the revival of economy is difficult,"" he said. On the challenges before the banking system, SBI Chairman said there are issues of capital, governance, potential risk around non-performing loans. Steps need to be taken to mitigate and manage those risks, he added.    ",business

"Sebi must blacklist board members, officials found guilty of governance deficit: Narayana Murthy","  Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy on Monday suggested that market regulator Sebi must blacklist board members and officials found guilty of governance deficit, and the compensation paid to them be recovered. Murthy also asserted that shareholders must also be provided access to full details of the investigation carried out after any whistleblower complaint, unless it contains information that could provide advantage to competitors. Speaking at an All India Management Association (AIMA) event on corporate governance, Murthy said if investigation into a whistleblower complaint concludes that the board and the officers of the company did not perform their fiduciary duties and contributed to a governance deficit by omission or commission, they are just asked to resign. ""Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) must blacklist these board members and officers. The shareholders must vote them out. In addition, the shareholders must claw back 100 per cent of the compensation or the fee received by the board and the officers during the tenure of the incident i.e. the date when the incident occurred to the time the investigation is complete - reported by the whistleblower,"" he said. He noted that whistleblowing should not be an act of revenge by a disgruntled employee, and the whistleblower must substantiate his or her complaint with data and facts. Stating that a corporation must provide total protection to whistleblowers against vendetta by the bosses, Murthy said an important duty of a board is protecting and enhancing the reputation of the company and discharging its fiduciary responsibilities. ""Therefore, addressing a whistleblower complaint in a transparent and trust-enhancing manner is a must. If the complaint is against a middle or a low level employee, an internal committee consisting of senior employees not connected with the accused and committed to total fairness and transparency, should be sufficient,"" he said. Murthy added that if the complaint is against any member of the board including the chairman or the CEO, the tendency of most Indian boards is to investigate such complaints themselves assisted by an outside law firm, pay them and obfuscate the issue. ""This is not a good idea because you cannot be the judge, the jury and the defendant,"" he said. He said the boards of some globally-reputed companies totally recuse themselves from the investigation of the complaint in such situations and top ten shareholders and highly-respected individuals from the society are brought in to investigate the whistleblower's complaint. Stating that transparency is an important tenet of good governance, Murthy said a shareholder has an unalienable right of access to every piece of information concerning an investigation. ""The full details of the investigation should be provided on the website of the company so that every shareholder has access to it. The investigating committee or its experts should provide every document of the investigation and answer every question,"" he said. Murthy added that the only two exceptions to this rule are that there should not be any selective disclosure provided to any one set of shareholders, and that any business information that provides a competitive advantage to the company vis- -vis its competitors in the marketplace cannot be disclosed to any shareholder. Interestingly, Infosys - in October last year - had informed stock exchanges of having received anonymous whistleblower complaints alleging certain unethical practices by the top management. It then started a probe into the matter and roped in external investigators. Later, the company had said the audit committee had found no evidence of financial impropriety or executive misconduct, giving a clean chit to the top management. In 2017, Infosys had witnessed a protracted stand-off between its high profile founders and the previous management over allegations of governance lapses and issues relating to severance package doled out to former executives, including ex-CFO Rajiv Bansal. After the tussle, the then CEO Vishal Sikka quit followed by some board members. Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani was then brought in as Chairman to steer the company, and Salil Parekh was appointed as the CEO in January 2018. Murthy, delivering the keynote, said corporate governance levels in India have improved considerably in the last three decades but there have been a few instances of serious governance deficits during the last five years. He noted that the primary functions of a corporate board include ensuring a robust quality growth of both the top line and the bottom line of the company, protecting and enhancing the reputation of the company as well as reviewing, critiquing and improving the strategy presented by the management. He added that the Board needs to recommend a fair and performance-based compensation to the CXOs and other officers of the company after consulting key, knowledgeable shareholders and create a succession plan for the CXOs and key officers of the company. The board also needs to identify risks and take timely action to mitigate them, put in place systems of information, control, checks and balances, and make sure that they are working and ensuring full compliance of regulations required by every statutory authority of the land. Murthy pointed out that managerial remuneration has to be a fair multiple of the compensation of the lowest level employee in the company and said if the lowest paid employee's remuneration was Rs 2-3 lakh a year, the CEO remuneration should be Rs 70-80 lakh.

Google forced Paytm to roll back cashback campaign which is legal in India’,"  Global internet giant Google’s Play store rules forced Paytm to roll back a UPI cashback campaign which is legal in India, digital payments company Paytm claimed on Sunday. The company in a blog alleged that it was arm-twisted to take down its campaign while Google Pay has been running similar cricket-based promotions. Google had blocked Paytm on its Play store following a policy update on September 18, ahead of the IPL cricket tournament, to disallow apps that support any unregulated gambling but restored the mobile app after a few hours after it rolled back the campaign. The homegrown financial services firm Paytm said that it was forced to comply with Google’s mandate to remove the UPI cashback and scratch cards campaign to get re-listed on the Android Play Store. “Offering both is legal in India, and cashback was being given following all rules and regulations set by the government,” Paytm said. The digital payments firm alleged that it was “arm-twisted” by the search engine major to comply with its biased app Play Store policies “that are meant to artificially create Google’s market dominance.” Paytm in the blog said that Google Pay has started its Tez Shots Campaign which clearly says, “Score Runs to earn assured rewards worth up to Rs 1 lakh” at the beginning of this cricket season itself. No immediate comments were received from Google on the subject.  Paytm in its blog said in the Tez Shots game a user can play as many times as they want and earn vouchers that they can unlock at each milestone. Finally, they qualify for a lucky draw through which they get assured tickets up to Rs 1 lakh with any qualifying payment. For different scores starting from 50 to all the way to 1000 plus they also earn rewards and discounts on different services that they avail via the Google Pay app, Paytm said in the blog.

"21 States accept Rs 97,000 cr borrowing proposal","  As many as 21 States, mostly ruled by BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday.   The states and union territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.  Finance Ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options.  The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the due GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said.  GST Council with full presence of states and UTs needs, as per the GST Act, only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.  In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.  Of this, as per Centre’s calculation, shortfall of about Rs  97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of COVID-19 on states’ revenues.  The Centre late last month gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market, and has also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.  The sources said few more states are also to intimate their borrowing option in a day or two.  They added that Manipur, which had earlier opted to borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore, later changed its preference to the Rs 97,000 crore option.  The non-BJP ruled states are at loggerheads with the Centre over the issue of funding shortfall.  The chief ministers of six non-BJP ruled states -- West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu -- have written to Centre opposing the options which require states to borrow to meet the shortfall.  While these states want Centre to borrow to meet the shortfall, Centre has argued that the revenue accruing from GST compensation cess goes to the states and the Centre cannot borrow on the security of the tax it does not own.  Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.  The Attorney General for India K K Venugopal had given his legal view on the compensation cess issue where he has opined that there is no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for loss of revenue.  He had opined that the GST Council has to find ways to meet any revenue shortfall arising out of GST implementation.  The payment of GST compensation to states became an issue after revenue from imposition of cess started dwindling since August 2019.  ",business

RS approves amendments to insolvency law,"  Decision on extending the suspension of relevant provisions will be taken next week: Fin Min Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed amendments to the insolvency law for suspension of fresh insolvency proceedings for at least six months starting March 25 amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman saying a decision on extending the suspension of relevant provisions will be taken next week. In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, the government decided to suspend the provisions starting from March 25 for six months by promulgating an ordinance in June. Default on repayments from March 25, the day when the nationwide lockdown began to curb coronavirus infections, would not be considered for initiating insolvency proceedings for at least six months. The six-month period is ending next week.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeks to replace the ordinance issued in June, was passed by a voice vote after a brief discussion.  Replying to the debate, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the suspension of provisions will end next week. “At the moment, amendment to the Code gives me a provision to only extend till one year. If at all, because it is coming to an end on September 25 this year, September 24 itself we have to make an announcement about what is going to happen. But even if I do, it means by March it should be ending...,” the minister said. The minister also clarified that insolvency proceedings against corporates defaulting on loans prior to March 25 will continue and the amendment will not stall those cases. A majority of the opposition parties also supported the bill but urged the government to provide interest waiver on loans to farmers and poor people suffering due to the COVID-19 crisis. During the debate on the bill, many members expressed fears over its possible misuse by corporates even as they hoped that it will help in reviving the economy. On members’ queries regarding liability of personal guarantors in the IBC, Sitharaman said the corporate debtor often has guarantors. “So, for comprehensive corporate insolvency resolution and liquidation we felt it was necessary that the insolvency of the corporate debtor as well as its guarantors are considered together to whatever extent it is possible,” Sitharaman said. On queries about the urgency to bring the ordinance in the first place, Sitharaman said that “between sessions if there is a need for ordinance because the ground situation demands it, I would think a responsive government’s duty is to at least use the ordinance to show that we are there with the people of India.” “So to that extent, I am sure the House will appreciate that as and when the government decides for ordinance it is because of that, and whenever the next session happens we come back,” she said. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said, businesses faced trouble. So it was decided “that it was better to suspend Sections 7, 9 and 10 of IBC so that we can prevent corporate persons, which are experiencing distress on account of the unprecedented situation, being pushed into insolvency proceedings”. Sections 7, 9 and 10 deal with initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process by financial creditor, operational creditor and corporate debtor, respectively. The minister further said the IBC is a critical part of business now, and cited data to show how the code had performed. Citing data for NPAs of commercial banks during 2018-19, she informed the House that Lok Adalats recovered 5.3 per cent, Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) recovered 3.5 per cent and SARFAESI recovered 14.5 per cent. On the other hand, IBC ensured 42.5 per cent of recovery. Sitharaman further said that most of the resolutions are happening to make the company to be a going concern only. “Priority is to keep the company to be a going concern rather than to liquidate them at the earliest,” she said adding that 258 companies were saved from going bankrupt through the IBC process, while 965 firms went for liquidation. “... 258 companies were rescued which means employment is back again with them. Companies which have been liquidated in total, three-fourths of them were defunct and were also given liquidation solution and therefore at least loss of employment was reduced,” she said. According to her, 258 companies rescued had assets of Rs 96,000 crore and the 965 companies sent for liquidation had assets of Rs 38,000 crore.  ",business
Lok Sabha OK’s ammendments in Taxation Laws,"  Lok Sabha on Saturday passed amendments in the Taxation Laws with heated debate on the PM Cares Fund, leading to mudslinging between the Congress and the BJP. The Taxation amendments were aimed to give changes in the tax filing dates including GST filings due to Covid-19 pandemic. It also included the tax concessions to the PM Cares Fund. The face-off started with Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur resuming his Friday’s controversial speech attacking the fund flow to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation from PMNRF, where Congress President Sonia Gandhi is also a Trustee. Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi countered it charging the Government with accepting money from Chinese companies and challenged it to give details of the donors. Congress  leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury objected to Thakur’s allegations against Sonia Gandhi, and the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Thakur took potshots on Chowdhury for calling him “Himachal ke Chokra (boy).” “You have the habit of calling names and later apologise. Yesterday you called me Chokra and I took credit for it. I come from Himachal and i am proud of being called as Chokra,” said Thakur. Chowdhury said he meant Balak (small boy). “You yesterday adopted an aggressive line. You are just a Balak and should not do that by commenting on great people like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,” he said. Replying to the debate, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also took objection to Chowdhury ridiculing Thakur. “He is young. But he is fourth time MP. Adhir ji, you are leader of the Opposition party and should not use such words.” The Finance Minister also objected to opposition terming the PM Cares Fund as “non-transparent”.  ",business

India Ratings gives ‘negative' outlook for banking sector in 2HFY21,"  India Ratings and Research has revised its outlook on the banking sector to 'negative' from 'stable' for 2HFY21. The ratings agency Ind-Ra said this revision was done in view of an expected spike in stressed assets, higher credit costs, weaker earnings on account of interest reversals and lower fee income, and muted growth prospects. Even the capital buffers for most public sector banks (PSBs) remain modest, it said. As per Ind-Ra's bear case, the spike in stressed assets due to the pandemic is expected to double the credit costs for banking system than estimated pre-Covid-19 levels for FY21. Consequently, Ind-Ra revised the rating outlook on PSBs to 'negative' for 2HFY21. ""PSBs' modest capital buffers are expected to deplete further in FY21, due to provisioning requirements. Also, pre-Covid profitability expectations for FY21 would be belied and most banks are likely to report net losses,"" the agency said in a statement. ""They may also need to continue to build-up their provision cover in FY22 for restructured assets as some of the restructured assets could turn NPA in FY23.

"Britannia Industries settles case with Sebi, pays over Rs 46 lakh","  Britannia Industries has paid over Rs 46 lakh towards settlement charge to markets regulator Sebi to settle a case of alleged failure to carry out due diligence before giving effect to transmission of shares and issuance of demand draft. Britannia Industries Ltd allegedly violated Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (LODR). Sebi agreed to settle proposed adjudication proceedings in the case pertaining to violation of LODR norms after it was approached by Britannia Industries with a plea under the settlement regulations ""without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusion of law"". In a settlement order passed on Thursday, Sebi said it has disposed of the adjudication proceedings initiated against the applicant (Britannia Industries). The case pertains to Sujit Kumar Gupta who held certain shares of Britannia Industries and died in 1985. Britannia Industries had forwarded a letter received from the legal heir of Gupta to its registrar and transfer agent, Sharepro Services (I) Pvt Ltd, wherein information about the shares held in the name of Gupta was requested. Subsequently, Sharepro received a letter from Balram Mukheijee, enclosing a document, purportedly a court order passed in 1985, which said he was entitled to certain shares held by Gupta. Thereafter, 33,750 shares were transferred to Balram in terms of the court order. Britannia was also a party to the purported suit filed by Balram, the order noted. The investigation conducted by Sebi revealed that the court order as submitted by Balram was a forged document. Therefore, it was alleged that Britannia Industries did not carry out the required due diligence before giving effect to transmission of shares. The transfers were allegedly approved without proper documents, the settlement order noted. In addition, Britannia Industries allegedly exhibited negligence in issuance of demand draft. It was alleged that in spite of being aware of the demise of Gupta, demand draft in favour of 'Sujit Kumar Gupta' was issued upon Britannia's instruction by HDFC Bank, which was subsequently encashed by some other Sujit Kumar Gupta. However, Britannia Industries, through an application filed in January 2020,  proposed to settle the proceedings. Thereafter, high powered advisory committee of the regulator considered the settlement terms proposed by Britannia and recommended the case for settlement upon payment of Rs 46,21,875. After approval of the recommendation by the panel of whole time members of Sebi, Britannia Industries remitted the settlement amount in August. ""In view of the acceptance of the settlement terms and receipt of settlement amount as above by Sebi, the instant adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee (Britannia Industries).... Are disposed of,"" Sebi said. However, the regulator can restore the proceedings under certain circumstances, which include failure of the firm to comply with the settlement order or if the firm is found to have made untrue disclosures.

GST rate on cars lower than pre-GST regime; auto cost should cut royalty payments: Fin Min sources,"  Auto companies should cut costs by reducing royalty payments to their parent companies abroad instead of asking the government to reduce GST, finance ministry sources said on Thursday, responding to criticism on high taxes in India.  Most globally established companies in the sector have flourished in the current taxation and regulatory regime, which is evident from the huge royalty payouts made by Indian partners to their foreign parent firms, they added.  Toyota Motor Corp is not looking at further expansion in India due to the country's high taxes, the firm's vice chairman of India unit Shekar Viswanathan had reportedly said in an interview earlier this week. Finance ministry sources said India's tax policy regarding the automobile sector has been quite consistent for the last three decades now in the form of allowing foreign investment and incentivising domestic manufacturing.  GST rates on automobiles are less than what VAT and excise duty rates used to be in the pre-GST times. All of a sudden, dissent in some quarters on tax rates on automobiles is surprising, they added. ""In fact, these companies should cut down their costs of manufacturing by cutting down the royalty payments to their parent companies abroad instead of asking the government to reduce GST,"" a source said. Taxes on automobiles are in the highest bracket across the globe without much exception, the sources said.  Japan currently has three types of taxes on automobiles -- once on the purchase, then an annual automobile tax based on engine size,  and finally a weight tax at inspections required once every two years.

BPCL may buyout Oman Oil stake in Bina refinery before its sale,"  Sale-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) may buy out the entire stake of OQ, the erstwhile Oman Oil Company (OOC), in their Madhya Pradesh joint venture, the Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL). Government sources said that BORL became a subsidiary of BPCL in March this year and the next step now is to convert it into a 100 per cent subsidiary before government stake in the company is sold to a strategic partner. For this to happen, it is essential that BPCL buys out OQ's stake in the refinery before its own sale process goes off the ground. This is important as BPCL's valuation may be impacted if a joint venture remains in its fold even after new owners take control. BPCL and OQ were 50:26 joint venture partners in BORL till March when BPCL converted 13 per cent of its earlier investment made in compulsorily convertible debentures and share warrants of BORL or Bina refinery. This made BORL a subsidiary of BPCL as its stake in the refinery increased to 63 per cent from 50 per cent earlier. The investment in convertible debenture was equivalent to 24 per cent additional equity stake in BORL. Sources said, if BPCL converts the remaining 11 per cent of convertible debentures to equity, its holding in BORL will increase to 74 per cent given that OQ has not shown interest in increasing stake in BORL by putting in additional equity. This will leave 26 per cent equity with OQ that the company will negotiate to buy to complete 100 per cent acquisition of Bina Refinery. OQ could not be reached for comments. The refinery has expanded its capacity from 6 million tonne (mt) per annum to 15 million tonne in two phases. While OOC had agreed to provide funds in the first phase of expansion to 7.8 mt with an investment of Rs 3,500 crore, it was unwilling to participate in the second phase that needed another Rs 30,000 crore over next five to six years. BORL was formed as an equal joint venture company way back in 1993. However, following inordinate delays in the implementation of the project, OOC froze its investment in the company at Rs 75 crore for a two per cent equity stake. In 2009, OOC paid a 50 per cent premium for a re-entry into the Rs 11,397-crore Bina refinery project, picking up 26 per cent stake.  ",business

GST compensation due to States at Rs 1.51 L cr,"  The GST collection during April-August declined on account of Covid-19 induced lockdown, and the compensation due to States stands at over Rs 1.51 lakh crore, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said on Monday.  The provisional GST compensation due to states/UTs for 2020-21 was highest for Maharashtra at Rs 22,485 crore, followed by Karnataka (Rs 13,763 crore), Uttar Pradesh (Rs 11,742 crore), Gujarat (Rs 11,563 crore) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 11,269 crore).  The compensation due to West Bengal stands at Rs 7,750 crore, Kerala (Rs  7,077 crore), Punjab (RRs 6,959 crore), Delhi (Rs 6,931 crore), Rajasthan (Rs  6312 crore), Telangana (Rs  5,424 crore) and Chhattisgarh (Rs 2,827 crore).  The total provisional GST compensation due to 31 states and UTs for 2020-21 put together stands at Rs 1,51,365 crore, as per data shared in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.  Thakur said the issue of pending compensation and future course of action to meet the shortfall was discussed in the 41st GST Council meeting on August 27 wherein states were given two options to meet their GST compensation shortfall for current fiscal year from market borrowing.  “It was also decided that states will give their preference views thereon. Thereafter on finalisation of scheme, states can choose either Option 1 or Option 2 and accordingly, their compensation, borrowing, repayment etc will be dealt as per their individual choice,” he added. In the current fiscal year, states are staring at a staggering Rs  2.35 lakh crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall.  Of this, as per the Centre’s calculation, about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and the rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states’ revenues. The Centre late last month gave two options to states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from market and also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.  In reply to a separate question, Thakur said the total net GST target for the Centre has been pegged at Rs 6,90,500 crore for 2020-21 in the Union Budget.  The actual net GST collection for the Centre till August 2020 is Rs 1,81,050 crore, which shows 26.2 per cent of the Budget Estimates(BE).  “The BEs for FY 2020-21 of GST in the Union Budget, 2020-21 were projected on the basis of assumption of higher growth of GDP, however as per CSO, MoS&PI ... The Nominal GDP for Q1 (April-June), 2020-21 shows a contraction of 22.6 per cent which is one of the major reasons for revenue shortfall in GST. “Other reasons for low tax collection inter-alia include nationwide lockdown measures implemented since March 2020 consequent to global COVID-19 pandemic which led to limited economic activities, extension of GST return filings timelines without payment of interest, late fee or penalty etc,” Thakur said.

SBI Card to enrol ‘delinquent’ customers in restructuring plans: MD,"  SBI Card is in the process of enrolling “delinquent” customers, who did not repay after the end of moratorium, in the RBI restructuring scheme or its own repayment plan to provide them more time for repayments, a top company official said. Due to the moratorium, a number of customers had not been paying for the first three months and the company treated them as standard accounts in line with the entire industry. However, since then, as the first moratorium ended, SBI Card made it a customer-led enrolment in the second moratorium in which a lot of customers did not enrol, SBI Card Managing Director & CEO Ashwini Kumar Tewari said. “Therefore, we had a large chunk of customers who came out of the moratorium. A lot of them paid up but many of them did not pay also. And these became what we call as more delinquent customers. “So with these delinquent customers, we are now working to enrol them either into the RBI restructuring scheme or our own repayment plans so that they get more time and better interest rate to pay their dues,” Tewari, who took charge over a month ago, told PTI in an interview. According to the company, it had Rs 7,083 crore under moratorium in May which came down to Rs 1,500 crore in June. Those who would be availing the company’s restructuring plan will have a benefit over the RBI restructuring plan as SBI Card will not report such cases to the credit scoring agency CIBIL. In March, the RBI had allowed the first three-month moratorium on payment of all term loans due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Later on, it was extended for another three months till August 2020.The process of restructuring is going on currently, Tewari said, adding a large number of accounts are to be enrolled and the company needs to make a 10 per cent provisioning on these accounts as per the RBI guidelines. Besides, there are some accounts that surely have become NPA (non-performing) due to the pandemic and therefore additional provisions need to be created for that, he said. “However, we will be very cautious, even if we get to that number (provisioning), we would still like to provide more because the future is still uncertain,” he added. Tewari said that in the second and the third quarter going forward, the company will be able to handle the situation better. “And of course it will be reverted to normal if the vaccine is made available and if the COVID-19 comes under control. I think from towards the end of quarter three and (beginning) quarter four, we will be in a much better shape,” he said further.  ",business

‘Amazon sold some items at inflated rate during Covid-19’,"  Amazon sold several items including essentials such as toilet paper and hand sanitiser at inflated rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, said a report by US-based consumer rights group Public Citizen. Amazon set prices of products during the pandemic to levels that would be considered violations of price gouging laws in many states of the country, showed the findings of the report released this week. Numerous examples of price increases were found on essential products sold directly by Amazon, it added. While the e-commerce giant publicly blamed so-called third-party sellers for price increases, it continued to allow them to increase their prices, the research showed. ""Amazon claimed that it took several steps to curb price gouging,"" said the report. ""But we have uncovered a pattern of significant price increases on essential products sold directly by Amazon, as well as price gouging by third-party sellers,"" it added. This report details 15 essential products that have been sold by Amazon during that Covid-19 pandemic with markups over the recent price on Amazon.com or other national retailers ranging from 76 per cent to more than 1,000 per cent. It also details 10 products sold on Amazon by third-party sellers during the same period with markups ranging from 225 per cent to 941 per cent. It showed that prices of many items increased manifold between May and August. Responding to the report, Amazon said that its service has ""no place for price gouging,"" The Verge reported on Friday. ""Our systems are designed to offers customers the best available online price and if we see an error, we work quickly to fix it,"" a spokesperson of the company was quoted as saying. The e-commerce giant's leadership had earlier also made clear that they do not tolerate price gouging and that they will stop third-party sellers from taking advantage of the pandemic. ""However, it is clear that not only are third-party sellers engaged in price gouging, but Amazon itself is selling essential products at significant price increases, and in many cases at a much higher price than other national retailers,"" the report by Public Citizen concluded.

Sebi raises minimum investment corpus in equities to 75 pc for multicap funds,"  Markets regulator Sebi on Friday tweaked asset allocation framework for multicap mutual funds, asking such funds to have a minimum corpus of 75 per cent invested in equities as against the present mandate of 65 per cent. Further, such funds will have to make a minimum investment of 25 per cent each in equity and related instruments of largecap, midcap and smallcap companies, Sebi said in a circular. All the existing multicap funds will ensure compliance with the provisions within one month from the date of publishing of the next list of stocks by industry body Amfi (Association of Mutual Funds in India), that is January 2021, it added. “In order to diversify the underlying investments of multicap funds across the large, mid and smallcap companies and be true to label, it has been decided to partially modify the scheme characteristics of multicap fund,” the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said. At present, multicap funds need to invest 65 per cent of total assets in equity and its related securities. Besides, there is no restriction on the exposure such funds need to make in large, mid and smallcap stocks, therefore, experts believe most of the multicap funds have higher allocation towards largecap, and residual exposure in mid and smallcap. “Now with this circular in effect, we will see most funds increasing their exposure in mid and smallcaps, while largecap already had lion’s share,” Samco Group Head - RankMF Omkeshwar Singh said.Jimeet Modi, founder and CEO, of Samco Group said the new provision will lead to increased buying in mid or smallcap by multicap MFs to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. This will be a disruption opposite to the one we saw in October 2018, when Sebi first introduced scheme categorisation. That had led to outflows from small and midcaps.

Covid pushes Govt to borrow full Rs 12 lakh cr for FY21 by Dec,"  The Government proposes to exhaust its entire borrowing of Rs 12 lakh crore for FY21 by December as it looks to step up expenditure to stimulate the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Government sources said that the aim is to exhaust the entire borrowing space early to give a lift to the economy during the current unlock phase. If need be, additional borrowing would be done for one or two months early next year to mobilise resources for any additional expenditure, sources said. In May, the Government raised the targeted levels of borrowings in the current fiscal by over 50 per cent to meet additional Covid-19 related expenditure. With this, the estimated gross market borrowing in the financial year 2020-21 increased to Rs 12 lakh crore in place of Rs 7.80 lakh crore as per budget estimate. With the change in borrowing plan for FY21, the government had also modified the indicative calendar for issuance of government dated securities for the first half of fiscal 2020-21 in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India. So, instead of H1 borrowing of Rs 4.88 lakh crore as per budget estimates, the RBI will now conduct auctions of dated securities worth Rs 6 lakh crore till September 30. The calendar would include issuance of dated securities with maturity ranging from 4-40 years. It will also have an auction of floating rate bonds.  ",business

Retail inflation will come down to below 4% only after December: SBI Report,"  Attributing the recent surge in retail inflation to huge government procurement and supply disruptions on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, an SBI report said that the price rise was likely to come down to below 4 per cent only after December.    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate during August, the data for which is yet to be released, was likely to remain at about 7 per cent, said SBI Ecowrap. The data is scheduled to be released on Monday. According to government data, the retail inflation rose to 6.93 per cent in July, mainly driven by rising prices of food items likevegetables, pulses, meat and fish. It was 3.15 per cent in the corresponding month last year.  “We expect August inflation numbers to be elevated at around 7 per cent or even higher and if the base effect is the primary reason, inflation could only come down to below 4 per cent possibly beyond December,” the SBI report said. However, the report further said that it looks difficult to believe that supply disruptions would normalise against the huge upsurge in pandemic in rural areas and this now poses an upside risk to inflation numbers.  “We are thus less hopeful of any rate cut in current fiscal/at best 25 bps as February MPC meeting would consider December inflation only,” it said.  The Reserve Bank of India, which mainly factors in retail inflation while arriving at its monetary policy, had kept the short-term lending rate unchanged to help tame inflation last month.  The report postulate that the jump in food prices is largely because of huge procurement by government and supply disruption that pushed up prices of cereal, potato, tomato and protein items.  It further said as inflation targeting comes up for review in 2021, “we believe, one way to make inflation targeting successful in the Indian context as time goes by is to reach the 4 per cent target over a particular business cycle rather than for a particular date...”  ",business

Other indicators, GST e-way bills, rail freight, port cargo traffic, domestic airlines’ passenger traffic, and the consumption of petrol and ATF, reported only a modest improvement in their YoY performance in July 2020, relative to June 2020. In contrast, the YoY performance of diesel consumption, hydroelectricity generation and refinery output had worsened in that month, with a continuing surge in infections causing the re-imposition of lockdowns in some states. As per the agency, Government expenditure, a key driver of economic activity in Q1FY21, reported a volatile trend in July 2020. It pointed out that revenue expenditure growth slipped from 40.1 per cent in June 2020 to 18.6 per cent in July 2020, while remaining substantial. However, capital expenditure contracted by 47.1 per cent in July 2020 after having more than doubled in June 2020. “The Indian economy is undoubtedly recovering from the lows seen in Q1 FY2021. However, the pace of the improvement in Q2FY21 is fragmented, with a sharper momentum in industry relative to services, amid a continuing healthy outlook for agriculture,” ICRA’s Principal Economist Aditi Nayar. “In our view, the contraction in GDP will narrow considerably to 11-13 per cent in Q2FY21, from 23.9 per cent in Q1 FY2021. While some indicators of the industrial sector displayed a sharp year-on-year (YoY) improvement in July 2020, relative to June 2020, especially automobile output and non-oil merchandise exports, the core sector displayed a muted recovery.” Besides, ICRA pointed out that available indicators for August 2020 have provided mixed cues, with a sharp improvement in coal and rail freight, juxtaposed with dips in electricity generation and diesel consumption.

""Reliance Industries Limited and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) announced today that Silver Lake will invest Rs 7,500 crore into RRVL, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries,"" the statement said. This investment values RRVL at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore. Silver Lake's investment will translate into a 1.75 per cent equity stake in RRVL on a fully diluted basis. This marks the second billion-dollar investment by Silver Lake in a Reliance Industries subsidiary after the USD 1.35 billion investment in Jio Platforms announced earlier this year. ""Reliance Retail Limited, a subsidiary of RRVL, operates India's largest, fastest growing and most profitable retail business serving close to 640 million footfalls across its about 12,000 stores nationwide,"" the statement said. With more than USD 60 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital and a focus on the world's great tech and tech-enabled opportunities, Silver Lake is the global leader in large-scale technology investing.

After monetising Jio Platforms -- which houses the firm's telecom arm and digital ventures, richest Indian Mukesh Ambani is looking to rope in investors in the retail business. Reliance may be looking to sell about 10 per cent of Reliance Retail. Late last month, Reliance acquired the retail and logistics businesses of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore to boost its retail vertical. Silver Lake was the first US private equity firm to invest in Jio after tech giant Facebook took a 9.99 per cent stake in the company for Rs 43,573.62 crore. Silver Lake bought 2.08 per cent in Jio in two tranches for a total of Rs 10,202.55 crore. Rival private equity groups KKR, Vista and General Atlantic followed Silver Lake to take stakes in Jio. Other notable investors included Google and Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. All investors in Jio Platforms including Silver Lake have been offered a chance to explore investing in Reliance Retail. Ambani had at Reliance Industries' recent annual general meeting stated that it had been approached by strategic/financial investors for a stake in Reliance Retail. Commenting on the transaction with Silver Lake, Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries, said, ""I am delighted to extend our relationship with Silver Lake to our transformational efforts of building an inclusive partnership with millions of small merchants while providing value to Indian consumers across the country in the Indian retail sector."" ""We believe technology will be key to bringing the much-needed transformation in this sector so that various constituents of the retail ecosystem can collaborate to build inclusive growth platforms. Silver Lake will be an invaluable partner in implementing our vision for Indian Retail,"" he said. Commenting on the investment, Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake, said, ""we are pleased to deepen our relationship with Reliance with this investment. Mukesh Ambani and his team at Reliance have created an outstanding world leader in retail and technology through their courageous vision, commitment to societal benefits, innovation excellence and relentless execution."" ""The success of JioMart in such a short time span, especially while India, along with the rest of the world, battles the COVID-19 pandemic, is truly unprecedented, and the most exciting growth phase has just begun. Reliance's new commerce strategy could become the disruptor of this decade. We are thrilled to have been invited to partner with Reliance in their mission for Indian Retail,"" Durban said.

Entire GST dues will be paid: FinMin to States,"  The Centre has reached out to the states again clarifying that it would pay entire GST compensation dues to them amid the mounting opposition over the borrowing options proposed in lieu of the shortfall in indirect tax collections. Sources in the Finance Ministry said that the entire shortfall of compensation to the states -- irrespective of whether it is on account of the GST implementation or Covid pandemic -- will be compensated and the same has been communicated to the states again. “It has never been the stand of Union Finance Minister that the loss of revenue due to Covid would not be compensated. The Central government has, time and again, committed that the entitlement of the states would always be for full compensation. The entire compensation sum on account of shortfall in collections of Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be paid and honoured”, a top government source said. Under the two options given to the states towards settlement of the GST compensation, the first option provides option to borrow by states and under a special dispensation from the RBI for a sum of about Rs97,000 crore this year. This is the amount of shortfall calculated by the Centre that is directly on account of the GST implementation. The option two allows states to borrow from market the entire expected GST compensation shortfall of about Rs2,35,000 crore in FY21. States have been asked to return with their views on the options so that the scheme could be operationalised. Doubts arose over the option 1 with few states saying that GST compensation would be paid to states only for the shortfall arising due to the implementation of the new indirect tax regime and not the shortfall arising due Covid-19 disruptions. Finance Ministry sources said that working out the revenue shortfall on account of GST implementation is just a mechanism to assess how much of the shortfall should be met by borrowing and how much could be deferred. Borrowing for meeting the entire shortfall when the private sector is struggling to stand back on its feet could hurt them badly. “If states go for option 1 and borrow Rs 97,000 crore, it does not mean they will have to forego the remaining compensation. The remaining compensation will be paid to the states after the above borrowing has been fully repaid. Therefore, where is the doubt about the Centre not meeting its commitment?”, asked a top  ",business
Govt to sell 15-20% stake in IRCTC via OFS,"  The Government plans to sell about 15-20 per cent stake in IRCTC via offer for sale (OFS) and would like to complete the transaction in minimum number of tranches.   Last month, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had invited bids from merchant bankers by September 10 for managing the sale in Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp (IRCTC).  However, it did not disclose the quantum of stake on offer in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Following this, a pre-bid meeting was held on September 4 with potential bidders.  DIPAM has now posted its response to the queries raised by potential bidders on its website. To a query on intended stake dilution percentage, DIPAM said, “The indicative percentage is 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The exact details will be shared with the selected merchant bankers.”  The government currently holds 87.40 per cent stake in IRCTC. To meet Sebi's public holding norm, it has to lower its stake in the company to 75 per cent. Shares of IRCTC on Tuesday closed 2.57 per cent lower at Rs 1,378.05 on the SE. Asked if payment would be made by the government to merchant banker after completion of every single tranche or cumulatively after the completion of entire transaction, DIPAM said, “GOI would not like to have an OFS overhang and hence would like to complete the transaction in minimum number of tranches as advised by merchant bankers based on market conditions.  “In case more than one tranche is used, pro-rata payment would be made to the merchant bankers”.  IRCTC, the only entity authorised by Indian Railways to provide catering services to railways, online railway tickets and packaged drinking water at railway stations and trains in India, was listed on stock exchanges in October 2019.

Fall in GDP alarming; time for bureaucracy to take meaningful action: Rajan,"  Terming the 23.9 per cent fall in economic growth in June quarter alarming, former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has said bureaucracy should come out of complacency and take meaningful action. The current crisis requires a more thoughtful and active government, he said, adding unfortunately, after an initial burst of activity, it seems to have retreated into a shell. ""The sharp decline in economic growth should alarm us all. The 23.9 per cent contraction in India (and the numbers will probably be worse when we get estimates of the damage in the informal sector) compares with a drop of 12.4 per cent in Italy and 9.5 per cent in the United States, two of the most COVID-19-affected advanced countries,""Rajan wrote in a post on his LinkedIn page. He further said the bureaucracy needs to be frightened out of their complacency and into meaningful activity. If there is a silver lining in the awful GDP numbers, hopefully it is that''. Rajan, currently a professor at the University of Chicago, said the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in India, so discretionary spending, especially on high-contact services like restaurants, and the associated employment, will stay low until the virus is contained. The eminent economist pointed out that the government's reluctance to do more today seems partly because it wants to conserve resources for a possible future stimulus. ""This strategy is self-defeating,"" he opined. Citing an example, Rajan said if one thinks of the economy as a patient, relief is the sustenance the patient needs while on the sickbed and fighting the disease. ""Without relief, households skip meals, pull their children out of school and send them to work or beg, pledge their gold to borrow, let EMIs and rent arrears pile up Essentially, the patient atrophies, so by the time the disease is contained, the patient has become a shell of herself,"" he noted. The former RBI Governor further said now think of economic stimulus as a tonic. ""When the disease is vanquished, it can help the patient get out of her sickbed faster. But if the patient has atrophied, stimulus will have little effect,"" he said. Rajan stressed that the recent pick-up in sectors like auto is not an evidence of the much awaited V-shaped recovery. ""It reflects pent-up demand, which will fade as we go down to the true level of demand in the damaged, partially-functioning, economy,"" he noted. Rajan pointed out that because of the pre-pandemic growth slowdown and the government's strained fiscal condition, officials believe it cannot spend on both relief and stimulus. ""This mindset is too pessimistic, but the government will have to expand the resource envelope in every way possible, and spend as cleverly as possible,"" he said adding it also has to take every action that can move the economy forward without additional spending. ""All this requires a more thoughtful and active government. Unfortunately, after an initial burst of activity, it seems to have retreated into a shell,"" the former RBI Governor added. Noting that India needs strong growth, not just to satisfy the aspirations of country's youth but to keep its unfriendly neighbours at bay, Rajan said temporary half-baked reforms , such as the recent suspension of labour protection laws in a number of states, will do little to enthuse industry or workers, and give reforms a bad name. He also suggested that reforms can be a form of stimulus, and even if not carried out immediately, a timeline to undertake them can boost current investor sentiment. ""The world will recover earlier than India, so exports can be a way for India to grow,"" he said. The government in May announced nearly Rs 21 lakh crore stimulus package to help the nation tide over the economic crisis induced by the coronavirus and subsequent lockdown. India's economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdowns weighed on the already-declining consumer demand and investment. The GDP contraction in the world's fifth-largest economy is compared with 3.1 per cent growth in the preceding March quarter and 5.2 per cent expansion in the same period a year back. This is the sharpest contraction since quarterly figures started getting published in 1996 and worse than what was expected by most analysts. The Indian economy was in a troubled state when the pandemic hit the world. Before the crisis hit India, the economy was already decelerating, real GDP growth had moderated from 7 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 and 4.2 per cent in 2019-20.

PVR defers major capex plans amid Covid pandemic,"  As the coronavirus pandemic and the eventual lockdowns have brought the multiplex industry to a grinding halt, PVR has deferred a significant portion of its capital expenditure (capex) plans and it will reassess them once the shutdown is over and its operations resume. Nitin Sood, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of PVR has said that owing to the company’s cost control measures, its fixed costs for the future will be lower than it had before. Even after reopening, the company does not expect these to return to their previous levels soon. His message to the shareholders in PVR’s Annual Report said that the company is already in discussions with its developers for renegotiating the rental arrangements. Sood added that PVR’s other costs too will undergo reductions until some normalcy is restored. “We have also temporarily deferred a substantial portion of our planned capital expenditures that we were undertaking, prior to the shutdown. All major capital expenditures will now be re-assessed once the shutdown is over,” the CFO said. Throughout this crisis, according to him, the company has focused on business continuity and has undertaken measures to mitigate the risk. “Our strategy has been two pronged. First, we have brought down our fixed costs drastically during this period of lockdown, and second, we have raised debt to preserve liquidity on the balance sheet,” he said. Among the fixed costs, PVR has invoked the force majeure clause for rental payment and Common Area Maintenance (CAM) charges, under its contractual arrangements and has suspended rental payments, while it continues to be in discussions with mall developers. “In order to manage our liquidity during the period the cinemas are shut, the management has voluntarily taken a cut of 50 per cent in their compensation, while the rest of our employees have forsaken 20-50 per cent of their salaries. Owing to these actions, we have been successful in bringing a significant reduction in our monthly fixed costs,” Sood said. He was of the view in the post-covid era but the company will be in a stronger position.  ",business

Saudi’s King slams Iran in UN speech,"  Saudi Arabia’s King Salman used his speech before the UN General Assembly on Wednesday to stress his country’s Islamic roots and slam rival, Iran. Reading from a piece of paper and seated at a desk under a large portrait of his father, King Abdulaziz, the monarch reiterated the sacred role of Islam in Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years ago in the mountainous caves of Mecca. He touted the kingdom’s role as president of the G-20 this year, and the billions of dollars in humanitarian aid Saudi Arabia gave to countries around the world in past decades. He refrained from criticizing the recent deals struck by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to establish ties with Israel, but stressed the kingdom remains committed to the Arab Peace Initiative that offers Israel full ties with Arab states in exchange for concessions that lead to a Palestinian state. He also said Saudi Arabia welcomes US efforts at resolving the crisis. He said the Middle East has been suffering from major political and security challenges, blaming Iran for much of the region’s instability. He accused the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon of sowing the political disarray that has been ultimately blamed for the devastating explosion at Beirut’s port last month. He said Saudi Arabia has tried to extend its hand over the years to Iran, “but to no avail.” He blamed Iran for targeting Saudi oil facilities last year, saying: “It demonstrated that this regime has total disregard for the stability of the global economy or stability of oil supplies to international markets.” The 84-year-old monarch’s prerecorded remarks make him only the second Saudi king to deliver a speech to the world assembly. The only other Saudi monarch to do so was his late brother, King Saud, in 1957 at the UN headquarters in New York.           ",world
"China blasts US House bill, denies forced labour in Xinjiang","  China on Tuesday lashed out at the passage of a bill by the US House of Representatives that threatens sanctions over the alleged use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region, calling the accusation a lie. Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the bill “maliciously slandered the human rights situation in Xinjiang” and sought to curb development and progress in the region while stirring up ethnic divisions and interfering in China’s internal affairs. “The so-called problem of forced labor is totally a lie fabricated by some organizations and personnel in the United States and the West,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing. The House voted 406-3 to declare that any goods produced in Xinjiang are presumptively made with the forced labor of detained Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, and therefore banned from being imported to the U.S. If enacted into law, it could force companies to avoid a region that products 80% of the cotton in China, one of the world’s top producers of the fiber, as well as tomatoes and manufactured goods. Members of Congress say the measure is needed to press China to stop a campaign that has resulted in the detention of more than 1 million Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups under brutal conditions.

"US obstructing global fight against emissions, climate change: China","  The US is guilty of “obstructing” the global fight against emissions, China said Wednesday, as Beijing seized the climate agenda by vowing to go carbon neutral by 2060 — a target welcomed by environmentalists despite its patchy detail. The goals, which include a pledge to reach peak emissions in 2030, are still the most concrete yet announced by China, which is the world’s biggest polluter and accounts for a quarter of the planet’s greenhouse gas blamed for rising temperatures. They also open a new divergence in relations with the US, which are already pinched by squabbles over trade, tech, defence and human rights. Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday renewed his support for the Paris climate accord and called for a green focus as the world recovers from the Covid-19 crisis. Under President Donald Trump, the United States — the world’s second-largest polluter — pulled out of the agreement, blaming China for the stalled momentum on tackling global emissions. “This clearly... seriously obstructs the progress of reducing global emissions and promoting green, low-carbon development,” China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in a statement on Wednesday. “What qualifications does such a country have to criticise China,” he asked, citing America’s hunger for plastics and its export of waste.

France’s Defence Chief misled nation on troops’ virus safety,"   France’s defence minister has admitted to misleading the nation about virus protections for air force personnel who evacuated French citizens from the hard-hit Chinese city of Wuhan and have been suspected of links to France’s first confirmed COVID-19 cluster. The revelation on Tuesday by Defence Minister Florence Parly to a Senate investigating committee is a further blow to the credibility of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government as it battles rebounding infections. Health Minister Olivier Veran is expected to announce new restrictions on gatherings Wednesday as the numbers of virus cases and hospitalisations mount. As China locked down the city of Wuhan in January, the French government started repatriation flights for French citizens there. One such flight returned to France from Wuhan on January 31, operated by 18 military personnel based in Creil, in the Oise region north of Paris, the defense minister said. In February, regional health authorities announced a virus cluster in the Oise region, and the first cases in France with no clear link to cases in China or Italy. Within weeks, France’s coronavirus case count had skyrocketed and the nation was in a lockdown. With over 31,400 confirmed virus-related deaths, France has the third-highest death toll in Europe after Britain and Italy. France is now reporting about 10,000 new infections a day.

Democrats propose sweeping bill to curb presidential abuses,"  House Democrats are proposing a sweeping bill to curb presidential abuses, a pitch to voters weeks ahead of Election Day as they try to defeat President Donald Trump, capture the Senate from Republicans and keep their House majority. The legislation, a wide-ranging package of new and revised bills, will be announced Wednesday morning by the heads of seven House committees. It would, among other measures, limit the president’s pardon power, strengthen laws to ban presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, better protect independent agency watchdogs and whistleblowers from firing or retribution and require better reporting by campaigns of foreign election interference. Each of the bill’s provisions is a response to actions by Trump or his administration that Democrats saw as abuses of presidential power. It builds on an elections and ethics reform package from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House passed soon after Democrats assumed the majority in 2019. “Since taking office, President Trump has placed his own personal and political interests above the national interest by protecting and enriching himself, targeting his political opponents, seeking foreign interference in our elections, eroding transparency, seeking to end accountability, and otherwise abusing the power of his office,” the committee chairmen and chairwomen said in a joint statement.

"Some freed Taliban prisoners returned to battlefield, says Afghan official","  A number of Taliban prisoners who were released by the Afghan government as a condition for peace talks have taken up arms again, top official Abdullah Abdullah said Tuesday. Abdullah, who chairs Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation and is overseeing the government’s peace efforts, said discussions with the Taliban in Qatar so far have been positive. However, he said some — though not the majority — of the 5,000 Taliban prisoners released by the government as a condition for talks had resumed the fight against Kabul. “I do know that some have returned to the battlefield, which is a violation of the agreement that they had made,” Abdullah said during an online conference with the US Council on Foreign Relations. Abdullah said talks between the two sides had begun in Doha on a positive note, as the delegations build some familiarity with each other. Yet the level of violence inside Afghanistan has not fallen, and he called on the United States, which launched the peace process with its own deal with the Taliban, and Pakistan, which maintains ties to the insurgents, to pressure them to agree to a ceasefire. “Unfortunately, so far, the level of violence is very high and to a level that is not acceptable for the people,” Abdullah said. “I repeat my call to the Taliban themselves and also to all partners who have any leverage over the Taliban to press on that point.” Abdullah said he planned to visit Pakistan in the coming days for the first time since 2008.

"Covid airborne, believe many scientists despite US body flip-flop","  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday removed language from its website that said the novel coronavirus spreads through airborne transmission, the latest example of the agency backtracking from its own guidance. The agency said the guidance, which went up Friday largely without notice until late Sunday, should not have been posted because it was an early draft. “ Unfortunately an early draft of a revision went up without any technical review,”  said Jay Butler, the CDC’s deputy director for infectious diseases. “ We are returning to the earlier version and revisiting that process. It was a failure of process at CDC.” Evidence that the virus floats in the air has mounted for months, with an increasingly loud chorus of aerosol biologists pointing to super-spreading events in choirs, buses, bars and other poorly ventilated spaces. They cheered when the CDC seemed to join them in agreeing that the coronavirus can be airborne. Experts who reviewed the CDC’s Friday post had said the language change had the power to shift policy and drive a major rethinking on the need to better ventilate indoor air. Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemistry professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies how aerosols spread the virus, told The Washington Post before the CDC reversed its guidance that “ this is a good thing, if we can reduce transmission because more people understand how it is spreading and know what to do to stop it.”   ",world
China responsible for unleashing plague of ‘China virus’ onto the world: Trump,"  US President Donald Trump blasted China on Tuesday for “ unleashing” “  the plague of the “ China virus” “  onto the world, demanding that the United Nations must hold Beijing accountable for failing to contain the coronavirus that has killed nearly one million people across the world, including 200,000 Americans. “ 75 years after the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again engaged in a great global struggle. We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy - the China virus - which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries,”  Trump said in a video statement to the 75th session of the UN General Assembly. Trump demanded that China, where the coronavirus emerged, be held accountable for failure to control the virus and for allowing it to spread across the world. “ As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China,”  he said. Doubling down on Beijing, Trump said that China condemned his travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes. “ In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world,”  Trump said. The COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected over 30 million people and more than 958,000 people have died. The US, with 6.7 million infections, crossed the grim milestone of 200,000 deaths. “ The Chinese government, and the World Health Organization -- which is virtually controlled by China -- falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission,”  Trump said. “ Later, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease. The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions,”  he said. Trump also slammed China for dumping millions and millions of tonnes of plastic and trash into the oceans every year, overfishing other countries’ waters, destroying vast swaths of coral reef, and emitting “ more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world. “ China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the US has, and it’s rising fast,”  he said, adding that he withdrew from the “ one-sided”  Paris Climate Accord and last year America reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement.

Julian Assange says he hears voices in prison: Psychiatrist,"  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange complained of hearing imaginary voices and music while detained in a high-security British prison, a psychiatrist who has interviewed him told his extradition hearing on Tuesday. Michael Kopelman, a psychiatrist who has interviewed Assange around 20 times, said the former hacker would be a “ very high”  suicide risk if he were extradited to the United States for leaking military secrets. He cited as evidence Assange’s “ severe depression”  and “ psychotic symptoms” , which included auditory hallucinations while in solitary confinement in his cell at the high-security Belmarsh Prison in southwest London. Kopelman told the Old Bailey court in central London that Assange said he hallucinated music and voices saying “ you are dust, you are dead, we are coming to get you” . Assange’s suicidal impulses “ arise out of clinical factors... but it is the imminence of extradition that will trigger the attempt,”  he added, warning “ he will deteriorate substantially”  if extradited. Assange’s partner Stella Moris has previously said she feared he would take his own life, leaving their two young sons without a father. James Lewis, representing the US government, quizzed Kopelman over the veracity of some of Assange’s claims, suggesting he may have made them up. Assange faces 18 charges under the US Espionage Act relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 500,000 secret files detailing aspects of US military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.  ",world

Opp in Pakistan launches alliance to oust PM Imran,"  Demanding Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s immediate resignation, the country’s major Opposition parties have launched an alliance to hold a countrywide protest movement to oust his government. A 26-point joint resolution was adopted on Sunday by the All Parties Conference (APC), which was hosted by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and attended by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) and several other parties.

Greece says talks with Turkey on East Med could restart soon,"  Greece and Turkey are close to reviving talks on a tense dispute over rights to exploit potential offshore natural gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean, a Greek official said on Monday. “We are close to restarting the exploratory talks. ... There will be an announcement when this is finalised but the atmosphere is good,” Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. Petsas also confirmed local media reports that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to visit Greece for a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to discuss the crisis, but added that the schedule is still being worked out. The two neighbouring NATO members have been at odds for decades over maritime boundaries for commercial exploitation in an area between Turkey’s southern coast, several Greek islands and the war-divided island of Cyprus. Under international pressure, Turkey pulled back a research vessel in the area while both countries have also eased their naval presence and halted military exercises. Greek-Turkish talks on the issue were last held in 2016. In recent years, the dispute that has been fueled by soured relations between the EU and Turkey and well as the discoveries of large natural gas fields in other parts of the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey argues that Greek islands near its coastline should be excluded from the calculation of commercial maritime boundaries that far exceed the limits of territorial waters. Athens calls the Turkish position a violation of international law but says it is willing to settle the dispute at an international court.          ",world
"$13,000 fine for breaking Covid rules in England","  People in England who refuse to self-isolate to stop the spread of coronavirus could face fines of up to 10,000 pounds ($13,000, 11,000 euros) under tough new regulations announced Saturday to tackle a surge in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that Britain was seeing a second wave of Covid-19, and introduced new restrictions for millions of people across northwest, northern and central England. In a further measure announced late Saturday, he said that from September 28 people will be legally obliged to self-isolate if they test positive or are told to by the National Health Service (NHS) tracing programme. “The best way we can fight this virus is by everyone following the rules and self-isolating if they’re at risk of passing on coronavirus,” Johnson said in a statement. “And so nobody underestimates just how important this is, new regulations will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus or have been asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.” Currently people who have symptoms or test positive are asked to self-isolate for 10 days. Those who live with someone who either has symptoms or tests positive must self-isolate for 14 days. The new fines will start at 1,000 pounds — in line with breaking quarantine after international travel — and rise to 10,000 pounds for repeat offences and the worst breaches, including businesses that threaten self-isolating staff with redundancy, officials said. In an incentive to get people to comply, those on low incomes will be able to claim an extra lump sum of 500 pounds if they are unable to work from home during their isolation.       ",world
US judge approves injunction to delay WeChat restrictions,"  A federal judge has approved a request from a group of WeChat users to delay looming US government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use. In a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government’s actions would affect users’ First Amendment rights as an effective ban on the app removes their platform for communication. WeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. It’s owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent. A group of WeChat users had made the request after the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it would bar WeChat from U.S. App stores and keep it from accessing essential internet services in the country, beginning Sunday night at 11:59 p.M. The government cited national security and data-privacy concerns in taking action against WeChat and imposing similar restrictions on TikTok, another popular Chinese-owned app. The restrictions on TikTok were pushed back by a week Saturday after President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would make TikTok a U.S. Company. WeChat users had argued the moves targeting the all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools would restrict free speech. In the ruling, the court said that a WeChat ban “eliminates all meaningful access to communication in the plaintiffs’ community,” and that an injunction would be in public interest. The US government had earlier argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.” Specific evidence about WeChat posing a national security threat was also “modest,” according to Judge Beeler.

Afghan airstrikes kill 24 civilians: Witnesses,"  Government airstrikes in the north of Afghanistan killed 24 civilians, including children, and wounded six others, witnesses told The Associated Press on Sunday. The two witnesses contacted by the AP said that most of those killed in Saturday’s airstrikes, which struck the village of Sayed Ramazan in northern Kunduz province, were civilians. The Khanabad district in the province where the village is located is Taliban controlled. The Afghan Defence Ministry, however, said the airstrikes killed 30 Taliban fighters, but added an investigation was being held into claims that civilians were among those killed. The airstrikes come as Taliban and government-appointed negotiators are meeting for the first time in Qatar to discuss the future of Afghanistan and an end to decades of war and conflict. Villagers said an initial airstrike targeted a house belonging to a Taliban fighter, whose home doubled as a check post that stops and frisks people to ensure they are not connected to the government. The explosion set fire to a nearby home, trapping a family inside, said Latif Rahmani who witnessed the airstrikes. Speaking to the AP by phone, Rahmani said farmers and villagers ran to douse the fire and rescue trapped family members inside when a second airstrike hit, killing many of them. Rahmani, who said he was working on his house at the time of the airstrike, warned his neighbors against running toward the burning buildings for fear of a second airstrike. “I yelled at people and told them not to go because maybe there would be another bombing, but they ran to help and to put out the fire,” Rahmani said. A second witness in the area, Kalamuddin, who like many Afghans uses just one name, said the lone Taliban fighter living in the house that was initially hit had been killed. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the airstrikes and said the Taliban had no military operations in the area at the time of the airstrike. The United Nations has harshly criticised both sides in the conflict for the relentless killing of civilians in Afghanistan’s protracted war. The peace talks in Qatar are part of a US brokered deal with the Taliban that will eventually lead to US withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. In early July, Afghan national army personnel fired mortars into a busy market in southern Helmand, killing 23 people. The Defence Ministry is still investigating the incident. Also Saturday, at least six rockets were fired at NATO’s Resolute Support base in southern Kandahar. No casualties were reported and no one claimed responsibility. NATO said in a statement that if the Taliban were behind the rocket fire, it could jeopardise the US peace deal in which the Taliban have promised not to attack US and NATO forces.

Sikh girl missing in Pakistan’s Punjab province,"  A 22-year-old Sikh girl is missing in Pakistan’s Punjab province and police have launched a case against an “unknown abductor”, according to a media report on Sunday. The incident occurred recently in Attock district’s Hassanabdal city, which is home to the famous Gurdwara Panja Sahib — one of the most sacred sites in Sikhism. According to a report published in Dawn newspaper, the girl stepped out of her house to throw away trash, but never returned. Her father runs a shop in Hassanabdal. The report, however, did not mention the date of the incident. A case had been registered by Hassanabdal police against an “unknown abductor” on the complaint of the girl’s father under Section 365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code for kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to marry, the report said, quoting Raja Fayyaz-ul-Hassan, the sub-divisional police officer. Police have launched a hunt for the missing girl, the officer said. Sub-Inspector Tahir Iqbal, the spokesman for district police, also said that a case was registered against an “unknown abductor” immediately after the girl’s father filed a complaint. The day after she went missing she reportedly sent a WhatsApp message to her father telling him that she had contracted a marriage of her own will and converted to Islam, said sub-divisional police officer Hassan. He said several police teams were looking for the girl so that she could be produced before a court of law and her statement recorded.  ",world
Trump supports deal to allow TikTok to continue,"  US President Donald Trump said he supports a deal that will allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States, after threatening to ban the Chinese-owned app in August. He told reporters at the White House he backs the deal with TikTok owner ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart to create a new company that will assume TikTok’s U.S. operations called TikTok Global. The U.S. Treasury said in a statement “Oracle will be responsible for key technology and security responsibilities to protect all U.S. user data. Approval of the transaction is subject to a closing with Oracle and Walmart and necessary documentation and conditions to be approved by” the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The Commerce Department said on Saturday it will delay by one week an order that had been set to take effect late Sunday that would stop Alphabet Inc’s Google  and Apple Inc from offering TikTok in their U.S. app stores. A person briefed on the matter said the administration had given the parties a week to close the deal. US shareholders are expected to control 53% of TikTok Global, a person briefed on the matter said, while Chinese investors will hold 36%. Trump said the new company will be “totally controlled by Oracle and Walmart ... All of the control is Oracle and Walmart.” Oracle said it will take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global. TikTok said under the deal, Oracle and Walmart will take part in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round in which they can take up to a 20% cumulative stake in the company. The remaining 80% will be held by ByteDance but is not clear if the ByteDance shares in TikTok Global will be distributed to ByteDance’s investors when TikTok Global is incorporated, according to the source. U.S. investors currently own about 40% of ByteDance. TikTok said it was “pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. Administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the U.S.” TikTok said Oracle will become the company’s “trusted technology provider, responsible for hosting all U.S. user data and securing associated computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are fully satisfied.” Trump offered strong support for the deal he said would create 25,000 U.S. jobs. “I have given the deal my blessing,” Trump said. “I approve the deal in concept.”        ",world

US media reported that the latest deployment included six Bradley vehicles and fewer than 100 troops. The deployment was believed as a response to the collision between the vehicles that occurred in northern Syria in late August. The US and Russia blamed each other for the incident, which left seven American soldiers injured. Kenneth Ekman, deputy commander of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, said in July that US troops in Syria interact with Russians almost daily. About 500 US troops are deployed in the northeastern part of Syria to fight against the Islamic State terror group and secure the oil fields operated by Kurdish forces.                ",world
US Top Court Justice Ginsburg dies at 87,"  US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the history-making jurist, feminist icon and a champion of women’s rights and social justice, has died of cancer at the age of 87. Ginsburg became only the second woman ever to serve as a justice on the nation’s highest court. A lifelong advocate of gender equality, she acquired the reputation of a cautious or moderate judge and will be remembered as a legal colossus. “Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tried and resolute champion of justice,” Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. Ginsburg’s death on Friday could open up another battlefront between President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival and former vice president Joe Biden.                  ",world
UNSC welcomes start of Afghan Peace Negotiations; encourages parties to engage in good faith,"  The UN Security Council on Friday welcomed the start of the Afghanistan Peace Negotiations in Doha and strongly encouraged the parties to continue pursuing confidence-building measures, including reduction in violence and to continue to engage in good faith. In a statement, the 15-member powerful organ of the world body reaffirmed its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of war-torn Afghanistan. “The members of the Security Council recognised that a sustainable peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that aims at a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire as well as an inclusive political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan,” it said. They “strongly encouraged parties to the negotiations to continue pursuing confidence-building measures including reductions in violence and to continue to engage in good faith.” The Council reaffirmed the importance of the UN’s role in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan and welcomed the efforts of all regional and international partners of Afghanistan in facilitating intra-Afghan negotiations and in helping the parties reach peace. The Security Council members also thanked the government of Qatar for facilitating the first round of negotiations. The first-ever direct talks between the Afghan government representatives and the Taliban began on September 12. Negotiators from the Afghan government and the Taliban will hold talks as part of intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha to bring a lasting peace to Afghanistan.  ",world
US court turns down challenge to Trump’s temporary ban on H-1B,"  An Indian-American federal judge has turned down an appeal by 169 Indian citizens who had challenged President Donald Trump’s order that barred foreign nationals on H-1B specialty occupation visas from entering the US till the end of the year. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. US District Judge Amit P Mehta of US District Court for the District of Columbia in his 11-page order on Wednesday said that Indian citizens, who are now trapped abroad during trips to India when borders closed, are unlikely to win their case contesting the travel ban proclamation of Trump.

China biopharma plant leak infects thousands with bacterial disease,"  Thousands of people in northwest China have tested positive for a bacterial disease after a leak from a state-owned biopharmaceutical plant making animal vaccines last year. Health officials in Lanzhou city said 3,245 people had contracted brucellosis, a disease often caused by close contact with infected animals or animal products that can bring about fevers, joint pain and headaches. Another 1,401 people tested as an early positive for the disease, and health authorities said there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission so far. Chinese authorities found a biopharmaceutical plant had used expired disinfectant in its production of Brucella vaccines for animals between July and August last year — meaning the bacteria was not eradicated in its factory exhaust.

Same-sex couples in HK get legal victory over inheritance law,"  Hong Kong’s high court on Friday ruled that same-sex couples should receive equal treatment under inheritance law, in a step forward for LGBT rights in the finance hub. But the victory came on the same day as a separate legal bid for full recognition of foreign same-sex marriages was struck down, underscoring what campaigners say is a lack of progress on equality issues. Hong Kong’s law does not allow same-sex marriage and does not recognise foreign unions, though limited recognition has been granted in recent years in several landmark rulings. Edgar Ng, a gay Hong Konger, last year launched a legal challenge against the city’s inheritance and intestacy laws, alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2018 he bought a government-subsidised flat, a year after marrying his partner in London, according to court documents. Under Hong Kong’s housing policy, his husband cannot be recognised as the joint homeowner, and Ng was concerned that should he die without a will, his property would not be passed to his partner. In the judgement handed down Friday, Judge Anderson Chow said the exclusion of spouses in same-sex marriages from their legal entitlements “constitutes unlawful discrimination”. The judge said “differential treatment is not justified”. LGBT rights activists with campaign group Hong Kong Marriage Equality described the ruling as an “important victory”. “The government should seize this opportunity to work with the LGBT+ community to implement marriage equality in the city,” the association said.

Russia OK’s 1st Covid prescription drug for sale in pharmacies,"  Russia has approved R-Pharm’s Coronavir treatment for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections and the antiviral drug could be rolled out to pharmacies in the country as soon as next week, the company said on Friday. Coronavir’s approval as a prescription drug follows the green light for another Russian COVID-19 drug, Avifavir, in May. Both are based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used there as the basis for viral treatments. R-Pharm’s announcement is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race against the virus. It is already exporting its COVID-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik-V vaccine. R-Pharm said it received approval for Coronavir after Phase III clinical trials involving 168 patients with COVID-19.  ",world
More migrant women say they didn’t OK surgery,"  Sitting across from her lawyer at an immigration detention center in rural Georgia, Mileidy Cardentey Fernandez unbuttoned her jail jumpsuit to show the scars on her abdomen. There were three small, circular marks. The 39-year-old woman from Cuba was told only that she would undergo an operation to treat her ovarian cysts, but a month later, she’s still not sure what procedure she got. After Cardentey repeatedly requested her medical records to find out, Irwin County Detention Center gave her more than 100 pages showing a diagnosis of cysts but nothing from the day of the surgery. “The only thing they told me was: ‘You’re going to go to sleep and when you wake up, we will have finished,’” Cardentey said this week in a phone interview. Cardentey kept her hospital bracelet. It has the date, Aug. 14, and part of the doctor’s name, Dr. Mahendra Amin, a gynecologist linked this week to allegations of unwanted hysterectomies and other procedures done on detained immigrant women that jeopardize their ability to have children. An Associated Press review of medical records for four women and interviews with lawyers revealed growing allegations that Amin performed surgeries and other procedures on detained immigrants that they never sought or didn’t fully understand. Although some procedures could be justified based on problems documented in the records, the women’s lack of consent or knowledge raises severe legal and ethical issues, lawyers and medical experts said. Amin has performed surgery or other gynecological treatment on at least eight women detained at Irwin County Detention Center since 2017, including one hysterectomy, said Andrew Free, an immigration and civil rights lawyer working with attorneys to investigate medical treatment at the detention center. Doctors on behalf of the attorneys are examining new records and more women are coming forward to report their treatment by Amin, Free said.                  ",world

Trump’s administration has been working to normalise relations between Serbia and Kosovo, two former Balkan war foes, and two weeks ago Serbian President Aleksander Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti signed an economic normalisation deal at the White House.

That court, in Barcelona, ruled that Torra was unfit to hold public office for 18 months for having violated electoral law.

Outgoing US ambassador to China to help Republican campaigns,"  Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said he will help out Republicans campaigning in his native Iowa after returning home next month. Branstad also told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV that he considered the phase one trade deal between China and the U.S. As the biggest achievement of his three years in China. Branstad, 73, said he would be working on behalf of President Donald Trump, Senator Joni Ernst and others, but not in any official role. “My son is very involved in (Trump’s) campaign, and I will be a volunteer to help him, to help Joni Ernst and other friends for the election in Iowa. But I will strictly be a volunteer,” Branstad told the station in a report broadcast Thursday. Ernst, the state’s junior senator, is locked in a tight race, with Democrats hoping to capture her seat on the way to flipping the Senate. As Iowa’s governor, Branstad was an early Trump supporter and has served as his top envoy to China during the most tempestuous period in relations since diplomatic ties were established in 1979. Branstad was governor of the major farming state for 22 years over two spans, from 1983 to 1999 and 2011 to 2017. Early in his first term, he met Xi Jinping, now China’s leader, when the then county-level Communist Party official visited Iowa on a 1985 trade trip. The phase one trade deal reached between the U.S. And China in January amid the ongoing tariff war between the sides represented a truce but did not address the more fundamental complaints of the American side. Still, Branstad said he believed it was ultimately in the best interests of both sides to follow-through with it. “This was a long and difficult process,” Branstad said. “They worked long and hard to reach an agreement that I think is fair and reciprocal. And it’s going to make a difference for both of our countries.” Branstad will leave at time when tensions between the sides are also running high over Taiwan, the South China Sea, the coronavirus pandemic and allegations of spying and technology theft. In July, the U.S. Ordered the closure of China’s consulate in Houston, calling it a “center of malign activity.” China retaliated by ordering the shuttering of the U.S. Consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.

Poison was on water bottle in Navalny’s hotel room: His team,"  The nerve agent used to poison Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting he was poisoned there and not at the airport as previously thought, his team said on Thursday. Navalny fell violently ill on a domestic flight in Russia last month and was subsequently airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Germany says he was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent. Russia says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned. A video posted on Navalny’s Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on Aug. 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances. “It was decided to gather up everything that could even hypothetically be useful and hand it to the doctors in Germany. The fact that the case would not be investigated in Russia was quite obvious,” the post said. It showed his team bagging several empty bottles of “Holy Spring” mineral water, among other items, while wearing protective gloves. “Two weeks later, a German laboratory found traces of Novichok precisely on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room,” the post said. “And then more laboratories that took analyses from Alexei confirmed that that was what poisoned Navalny. Now we understand: it was done before he left his hotel room to go to the airport.” Russia has carried out pre-investigation checks, but said it needs to see more medical analysis before it can open a formal criminal investigation into the case.

US envoy begins second high-level visit to Taiwan,"  US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach arrived in Taiwan on Thursday for the second visit by a high-level American official in two months, prompting a stern warning and threat of possible retaliation from China. Beijing considers Taiwan its own and opposes all official contacts between other countries and the self-governing island. Krach arrived at an air force base in Taipei, the capital, for a three-day visit. Wearing a face mask, he bumped elbows in greetings with Taiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Harry Ho-Jen Tseng. Krach, the highest-level State Department official to visit the island in decades, is to meet Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other senior officials, the island’s foreign ministry said. The visit by Krach, who is undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, follows a high-profile trip in August by U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar, the highest-level U.S. Cabinet official to visit since the U.S. Switched formal relations from Taiwan to China in 1979. However, the U.S. Has maintained unofficial ties with Taiwan since the official diplomatic break and is the island’s most important ally and provider of defense equipment. Ahead of Krach’s arrival, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, had lunch Wednesday with Taiwan’s top official in New York, a meeting she called historic and a further step in the Trump administration’s campaign to strengthen relations with Taiwan. Craft said her lunch with James K.J. Lee, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, was the first meeting between a top Taiwan official and a U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations since 1971, when the China seat at the U.N. Was passed from Taipei to Beijing. “I’m looking to do the right thing by my president, and I feel that he has sought to strengthen and deepen this bilateral relationship with Taiwan and I want to continue that on behalf of the administration,” she told The Associated Press. In Taiwan, Krach is to attend a banquet hosted by Tsai on Friday and hold discussions on the creation of a new economic and commercial dialogue, according to Taiwan’s de facto ambassador in the U.S., Hsiao Bi-khim. He will also attend a memorial service for former President Lee Teng-hui, who led the island’s transition to democracy and died at age 97 in July. Krach’s visit and Craft’s lunch with Lee are certain to exacerbate mounting tensions between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Hong Kong and the South China Sea. China condemned the visit on Thursday and warned it could retaliate. At a daily briefing Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Krach’s visit violates U.S. Commitments to China and “bolsters the separatist forces of Taiwan independence and undermines China-U.S. Relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” adding that Beijing had “lodged solemn complaints” with Washington over the matter. “We urge the U.S. To fully recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue ... Immediately stop official exchanges and actions of improving substantive relations with Taiwan, and handle Taiwan-related issues cautiously,” Wang said. “China will make necessary responses in accordance with the development of the situation.”            ",world

"Navalny posts hospital photo of himself, plans Russia return","  Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny posted a picture of himself from his hospital bed in Germany on Tuesday, looking gaunt but joking wryly about his condition and saying that he was enjoying the ability to finally breathe on his own after being poisoned with a nerve agent. The Instagram post was the first image of the 44-year-old released since he was taken to Berlin’s Charite hospital two days after falling ill on a domestic flight in Russia on Aug. 20. “Hi, this is Navalny,” he wrote in the Russian-language post. “I have been missing you. I still can’t do almost anything on my own, but yesterday I managed to breathe on my own for the entire day.” Navalny had been kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote before hospital officials said on Sept. 7 that his condition had improved enough for him to be brought out of it. On Monday, the hospital said he had been removed from mechanical ventilation and was able to leave his bed for “short periods of time.” In the photo, Navalny is being given a hug by his wife Yulia and is flanked by his two children as he sits upright in his bed in a hospital gown. His statement even had the ring of his well-known sarcastic humor. “Just on my own, no extra help, I didn’t even use the simplest valve in my throat,” he said of being able to breathe without ventilation. “I liked it very much. It’s a remarkable process that is underestimated by many. Strongly recommended.” Despite his recovery, doctors have said they cannot rule out long-term health issues associated with the poisoning. Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, tweeted that once he had recovered, Navalny plans to return to Russia. “No other option has ever been considered,” she wrote. Leonid Volkov, a top associate of Navalny, refused to give any details on his condition or his possible return when reached by The Associated Press on Tuesday.       ",world
Iran warns US against strategic mistake after Trump threat,"  Iran warned the US on Tuesday against making a “strategic mistake” after President Donald Trump threatened Tehran over reports it planned to avenge the killing of top general Qasem Soleimani. “We hope that they do not make a new strategic mistake and certainly in the case of any strategic mistake, they will witness Iran’s decisive response,” government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a televised news conference. A US media report, quoting unnamed officials, said that an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the US ambassador to South Africa was planned before the US presidential election in November. “Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday. Rabiei expressed regret that “the president of a country who has claims to global management and order would make hasty, agenda-fuelled and dubious remarks on such a weak basis.” He warned that reacting to such reports would “achieve nothing but disruption to the region and to world calm” and advised Trump to “refrain from fresh adventurism... for the sake of winning a new term as president.” On Monday, the foreign ministry denied the report of an assassination plot as “baseless” and part of “repetitive and rotten methods to create an anti-Iranian atmosphere”. Relations between Washington and Tehran have been tense ever since the Islamic revolution of 1979. They have deteriorated sharply since Trump unilaterally pulled out of a landmark international nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions.  ",world
"Trump: Retaliation will be 1,000 times greater","  President Donald Trump has warned Iran that any attack against the US would be retaliated with “1,000 times greater in magnitude” after media reports that Tehran is planning to avenge the killing of top general Qasem Soleimani in January. The death of Gen Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a US airstrike near Baghdad’s airport marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran, since US President Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions. Iran had vowed to seek revenge for Gen Soleimani’s killing. “Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!” Trump said in a tweet after news reports emerged that Iran is planning some kind of attack against the US. “Iran may be planning an assassination or other attack, against the US in retaliation for the killing of terrorist leader Soleimani, which was carried out for his planning a future attack, murdering US Troops, and the death & suffering caused over so many years,” Trump wrote. In a news report based on unnamed intelligence sources, the Politico said “the Iranian government is weighing an assassination attempt against the American ambassador to South Africa Lana Marks. “If carried out, it could dramatically ratchet up already serious tensions between the US and Iran and create enormous pressure on Trump to strike back — possibly in the middle of a tense election season,” the American news outlet said. An intelligence source told Fox News that the intel community is taking the threat against the ambassador seriously and believe the Iranian regime potentially has the ability to act on an assassination plot. Iran has in the past planned assassinations of American ambassadors -- which is partly why the intelligence community is taking this particular threat assessment seriously, the news channel said. Iran has denied the allegations. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement that the assassination allegations were part of ongoing anti-Iranian propaganda by the Americans ahead of the elections scheduled for November 3. Meanwhile, reacting on the reports South Africa’s State Security Agency (SSA) said that it has “noted the rising public interest on the matter and would like to assure all South African citizens and interested parties that the matter is receiving the necessary attention.”             ",world

The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison. Attorney Eric Lewis, appearing as a defense witness, said the scope of the indictment pointed to “a very aggressive approach to sentencing on the part of the Government.” “All signs point to a very long sentence, measured in many decades,” said Lewis, a senior partner at Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss in Washington, DC. “We are looking at a sentence somewhere between 20 years, if everything goes brilliantly, to 175 years, which the government could easily ask for,” he said.

Belarus leader visits Russia to secure support amid protests,"  Belarus’ authoritarian president visited Russia Monday in a bid to secure more loans and political support, as demonstrations against the extension of his 26-year rule entered their sixth week. Alexander Lukashenko’s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi come a day after an estimated 150,000 people flooded the streets of the Belarusian capital, demanding Lukashenko’s resignation. The Interior Ministry said 774 people were arrested in Minsk and other cities of Belarus for holding unsanctioned rallies on Sunday. Protesters in Belarus have dismissed Lukashenko’s reelection for a sixth term in the August 9 vote as rigged. The United States and the European Union have criticised the election as neither free nor fair and urged the Belarusian leader to engage in talks with the opposition, a demand he rejected. In a bid to win Moscow’s support, the 66-year-old former state farm director has tried to cast the protests as an effort by the West to isolate Russia, which sees the neighbour as a key bulwark against NATO and a major conduit for energy exports to Europe. Russia and Belarus have a union treaty envisaging close political, economic and military ties, but they have often engaged in acrimonious disputes. Before the election, Lukashenko repeatedly accused the Kremlin of pressing Belarus to abandon its independence. But with the United States and the European Union criticising the election and readying a package of sanctions, Lukashenko now has to rely squarely on Russia’s support.             ",world
Italy’s initial virus hotspot back to school after 7 mths,"  Codogno (Italy): The morning bell on Monday marked the first entrance to the classroom for the children of Codogno since February 21, when panicked parents were sent to pick up their children after the northern Italian town gained notoriety as the first in the West to record local transmission of the coronavirus. While all of Italy’s 8 million school students endured Italy’s strict 2½-month lockdown, few suffered the trauma of the children of Codogno, whose days were punctuated by the sirens of passing ambulances. “Many lost grandparents,” said Cecilia Cugini, the principal of Codogno’s nursery, elementary and middle schools.

China warns US over US-Taiwan economic talks,"  China warned the United States on Monday of potential “serious damage” to their relations if it does not withdraw from an upcoming economic meeting with Taiwan that is expected to be attended by a senior American official. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin urged the US at a daily briefing to “stop all forms of official exchanges with Taiwan, so as to avoid serious damage to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.” Taiwanese media reported that US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach is planning to visit the island later this week for an economic and commercial dialogue with Taiwan’s government. The visit would follow one by US Health Secretary Alex Azar last month. Azar was the highest-level US Cabinet official to visit since a break in formal ties between the US and Taiwanese government in 1979, when the US accepted a “one-China policy” with Beijing as its government. A visit by Krach is likely to inspire further anger from China. China considers self-ruled Taiwan part of its own territory, and strongly opposes any official contacts between other nations and the island. Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed last week that it was in negotiations with the US on such talks, but did not comment on a specific date or who might attend from Washington.

UK ex-PMs call for boycott of Johnson’s Brexit bill plan,"  Britain’s former prime ministers from rival parties, Tony Blair and John Major, united on Sunday to call on members of Parliament to boycott Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposed law aimed at overriding parts of the Brexit divorce agreement. Ahead of the Internal Market Bill coming up for debate in the House of Commons on Monday, Major as a member of Johnson’s own Conservative Party and Blair from the Opposition Labour Party warned that what is being proposed by the prime minister is “shocking” and has wide-ranging ramifications on all future trade negotiations, not only with the European Union (EU) but with other nations. “The overt repudiation of the treaty — by seeking to override unilaterally the provisions agreeing to the application of certain EU rules to Northern Ireland — strikes at the very heart of the withdrawal agreement,” the duo wrote in a joint article for ‘The Sunday Times’. “If the government has concerns about specific parts of the withdrawal treaty, there are ready mechanisms within it to resolve them amicably; in the first instance by negotiation between the UK and the EU and, if that fails, through independent arbitration. It has chosen to ignore these options. Instead, it has thrown the withdrawal treaty into uncertainty and given the EU genuine reason to question whether Britain can be relied upon in any future trade agreements with the EU,” they wrote. Major was a Conservative prime minister from 1990 to 1997. His Labour successor Blair served as Britain’s PM from 1997 to 2007. Amid growing discord over the issue within his own party, Boris has sought the backing of his MPs for the new Bill saying the EU is threatening to impose a customs border in the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The Bill focuses on the Northern Ireland Protocol – the part of the Brexit divorce designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. If it became law, it would give UK ministers powers to modify or “disapply” rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from January 2021, unless the UK and EU are able to strike a trade deal ahead of that.

Belarus police detain 250 protesters in Minsk as crowds swell,"  Belarus police detained at least 250 protesters as tens of thousands demonstrated in the capital Minsk in advance of talks between strongman Alexander Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Oktyabrskaya Square in central Minsk was fenced off with barbed wire with armed law enforcement forces seen behind it.                  ",world
Bloomberg to spend at least $100m to help Biden in Florida,"  Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is committing at least $100 million to help Joe Biden’s presidential campaign in the crucial battleground state of Florida. Bloomberg’s late stage infusion of cash reflects Democrats’ concerns about the tight race in a state that is a priority for President Donald Trump. A victory for Joe Biden in Florida, the largest of the perennial battleground states, would significantly complicate Trump’s path to reaching the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure a second term.

Whistleblower’s claims on Russian interference fits pattern,"  A whistleblower’s allegation that he was pressured to suppress intelligence about Russian election interference is the latest in a series of similar accounts involving former Trump administration officials, raising concerns the White House risks undercutting efforts to stop such intrusions if it plays down the seriousness of the problem. There is no question the administration has taken actions to counter Russian interference, including sanctions and criminal charges on Thursday designed to call out foreign influence campaigns aimed at American voters. But Trump’s resistance to embracing the gravity of the threat could leave the administration without a consistent and powerful voice of deterrence at the top of the government heading into an election that US Officials say is again being targeted by Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is not deterred,” said Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee. Himes said Putin feels “empowered, probably inoculated in the U.S. Because of the president’s behaviour.” Brian Murphy, the former top intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security, alleges in the complaint made public Wednesday that he was instructed to hold back on reports on Russian interference because they “made the president look bad.” That follows previous reports that Trump berated his then-intelligence director after a congressional briefing about Moscow’s interference and that the president sought the firing of another official who told Congress he supported intelligence agencies’ assessment that Russia had interfered on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 election. The department denied Murphy’s allegation, and the White House issued a statement describing instances in which it said the president had it taken action against Russia. “This president has been resolute that any foreign adversary seeking to disrupt our elections will face tremendous consequences,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said. Senior Trump administration officials have been eager to focus more on China in discussing election interference, asserting that Beijing is the more potent danger. Though intelligence officials do say China is a major espionage concern, there is also bipartisan consensus, including in a Republican-led Senate report, that Russia directly interfered in 2016 with the goal of helping Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. This year, intelligence officials say, Russia is working to denigrate Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Murphy is not alone in alleging that he felt stymied from raising the Russia threat head-on. Miles Taylor, as chief of staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, participated in high-level administration meetings and has in recent weeks publicly conveyed his concerns about Trump’s leadership. Taylor said Nielsen had to create a “shadow” National Security Council to deal with the issue because she felt the president’s own team had not convened enough meetings to coordinate a response.

Rain-triggered landslide kills 11 people in Nepal,"  A massive landslide triggered by torrential rains in central Nepal has killed at least 11 people, including seven women, and left 20 missing, an official said on Sunday. The landslide swept away some 15 houses in Bhirkharka area of Barhabise Rural Municipality in Sindhupalchowk district, 120 kilometres east of Kathmandu, on Saturday night. A security team comprising the Nepal Army and Nepal Police personnel have been dispatched to the incident site for carrying out search and rescue operation, the official said. The bodies of 11 people, including seven women, have been recovered from the site and search operations have been going on to rescue the missing people, according to the home ministry. The landslide occurred due to incessant rainfall in the area for the past couple of days. Some 247 houses have been identified as risky due to landslide in the area which lies near Nepal-Tibet border. The incident occurred as the government failed to act promptly despite the local residents demanding that they be shifted to safer areas. This is the second landslide that hit Barhabise rural municipality area this monsoon. At least 249 people have lost their lives and 49 others have gone missing in different incidents of landslide in Nepal this monsoon season.             ",world
Chinese virologist claims she has proof virus was made in Wuhan lab,"  A Chinese virologist who has reportedly been in hiding for fear of her safety has stepped out into the public eye again to make the explosive claim that she has the scientific evidence to prove Covid-19 was man-made in a lab in China. Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a scientist who says she did some of the earliest research into COVID-19 last year, made the comments Friday during an interview on British talk show “Loose Women.” When asked where the deadly virus that has killed more than 900,000 around the globe comes from, Yan — speaking via video chat from a secret location — replied, “It comes from the lab — the lab in Wuhan and the lab is controlled by China’s government.” She insisted that widespread reports that the virus originated last year from a wet market in Wuhan, China, are “a smokescreen.” “The first thing is the [meat] market in Wuhan … is a smokescreen and this virus is not from nature,” Yan claimed, explaining that she got “her intelligence from the CDC in China, from the local doctors.” The virologist has previously accused Beijing of lying about when it learned of the killer bug and engaging in an extensive cover-up of her work.

US-brokered deal makes Bahrain partner to Israel crimes: Iran,"  Iran on Saturday angrily accused Bahrain of stirring instability after US President Donald Trump announced Manama and Israel were opening ties in a landmark deal that reinforces America’s push to redraw Middle East conflicts. Calling it a “truly historic day,” Trump said on Friday that Israel and Bahrain were establishing full diplomatic and commercial relations. “They will exchange embassies and ambassadors, begin direct flights between their countries and launch cooperation initiatives across a broad range of sectors, including health, business, technology, education, security and agriculture,” he said. Bahrain said in a joint statement it had agreed to formalise the deal with Israel at a ceremony Tuesday in the White House, where the United Arab Emirates will also sign off on its own thaw with Israel announced in mid-August. Shiite Iran, which has especially tense ties with Bahrain and is a sworn enemy of Washington, slammed its Gulf neighbour over the deal. “The rulers of Bahrain will from now on be partners to the crimes of the Zionist regime as a constant threat to the security of the region and the world of Islam,” it said. Bahrainis opposed to the agreement vented their frustration on social media, using the hashtags “Bahrainis against normalisation” and “normalisation is betrayal”. “A black day in the history of Bahrain,” wrote former lawmaker Ali Alaswad. Iran’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah said the deal was a “betrayal and a painful stab in the back of the Palestinian people”. Turkey condemned it, saying it would “further embolden Israel to continue its illegal practices... and attempts to make the occupation of Palestinian territories permanent”. Bahrain, a Sunni-ruled kingdom with a large Shiite population, relies heavily on the United States, which stations its Fifth Fleet in the tiny but strategic Gulf archipelago. The joint statement said Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump had spoken hours before announcing the new breakthrough. During the phone call, the king “stressed the need to reach a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic option, in accordance with the two-state solution and relevant resolutions of international legitimacy”.

Warring Afghans meet to find peace,"  Afghanistan’s warring sides started negotiations on Saturday for the first time aimed at ending decades of war, bringing together delegates appointed by the Afghan government and the Taliban. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the opening ceremony, which was held in Qatar where the meetings will take place. It’s the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity by the Trump administration ahead of the US presidential election in November. The discussions are important in the search for lasting peace that will also provide an exit for US and NATO troops after nearly 19 years. The sides will try to tackle tough issues. This includes the terms of a permanent cease-fire, the rights of women and minorities and the disarming of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and militias loyal to warlords, some of them aligned with the government. The talks in Doha follow the US-brokered recognition of Israel by two Gulf nations — Bahrain on Friday and the United Arab Emirates earlier this month. The Afghan sides are also expected to discuss constitutional changes, and power sharing. Even seemingly mundane issues like the flag and the name of the country — the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or as the Taliban’s administration had been known, when it ruled, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan — could find their way on to the negotiation table and roil tempers. Among the government-appointed negotiators are four women, who vow to preserve women’s rights in any power-sharing deal with the fundamentalist Taliban. This includes the right to work, education and participation in political life -- all denied women when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan for five years. The Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harbouring Osama bin Laden, the architect of the September 11 terrorist attacks on America. There are no women on the Taliban’s negotiation team, led by their chief justice Abdul Hakim. Pompeo has said he expected the discussions to be contentious. Washington’s peace envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that launching the talks is an important achievement, but that “there are difficulties, significant challenges on the way to reaching agreement”. “This is a test for both sides, for the Taliban and the government,” he said. “Can they reach an agreement despite differences, in terms of their visions for the future of Afghanistan?” The intra-Afghan negotiations were laid out in a peace deal Washington signed with the Taliban on February 29. At that time the deal was touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in 40 years of war.           ",world
Bangladesh professor faces sedition charges,"  A Dhaka University professor along with two others is facing sedition charges for allegedly defaming Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, and distorting the history of the 1971 Liberation War.

"China, Philippine defense chiefs discuss territorial dispute","  The Philippine defense chief told his Chinese counterpart on Friday that Manila will adhere “without any possibility of compromise” to a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated most of Beijing’s rival claims in the South China Sea, according to a Philippine statement about the meeting. But the statement was later withdrawn and the contentious comment removed. Chinese Gen. Wei Fenghe is in Manila for talks with Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and President Rodrigo Duterte. His visit follows a series of protests by the Philippines over China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the busy waterway. The territorial disputes between the countries remain unresolved, although their ties have improved greatly under Duterte, who has sought investment, infrastructure funding and military assistance from China. After the defense chiefs met, the Philippine defense department issued an initial statement saying Lorenzana had reaffirmed Philippine adherence “without any possibility of compromise” to the arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s territorial claims in the sea on historical grounds. China refused to participate in the arbitration by a U.N.-backed tribunal, and then dismissed its ruling as a “sham” and continues to defy it.                ",world
"Ex-cops blame one another, seek own trials in George Floyd’s death","  Attorneys for four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd say that each client should get his own trial, as the officers try to diminish their roles in the Black man’s death by pointing fingers at one another. Prosecutors say all four officers should be tried together because the nature of the charges and evidence is similar and “it is impossible to evaluate any individual Defendant’s conduct in a vacuum.” The former officers are scheduled to appear in court Friday for a hearing on several issues, including the prosecution’s request to hold a joint trial. Other issues that will be argued include defense requests to move the trial away from Minneapolis and to sequester the jury and keep jurors anonymous. Floyd, who was in handcuffs, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against his neck as Floyd said he couldn’t breathe and became motionless. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. Defense requests to dismiss charges won’t be addressed at Friday’s hearing. A trial is scheduled for March. Friday’s hearing will also mark the first time Chauvin is expected to appear in a courtroom. He is in state custody and has attended previous hearings via videoconference. Prosecutors say the case should proceed with one trial because the evidence – including witness statements, body-camera video and police department policy on use of force – is similar for each officer. Prosecutors say the officers also acted in close concert. “Here, all four Defendants worked together to murder Floyd: Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane pinned Floyd face-down, while Thao stopped the crowd from intervening, enabling the other Defendants to maintain their positions. Defendants also discussed and coordinated their actions throughout the incident,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing.      ",world
"Kim Jong Un displayed executed uncle’s headless body, claims Trump","  The headless body of Kim Jong Un’s executed uncle was displayed to senior North Korean officials, US President Donald Trump told the author of an upcoming book on the US president. Jang Song Thaek, the North Korean leader’s uncle by marriage and a hugely powerful figure within the regime, was purged for treason and corruption in 2013, in what was widely seen as Kim mercilessly asserting his authority. Kim “tells me everything. Told me everything,” Trump told the Washington Post investigative journalist Bob Woodward, according to his forthcoming book “Rage”. “He killed his uncle and he put the body right in the steps,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to a building used by senior officials. “And the head was cut, sitting on the chest,” he added in excerpts from the book seen by AFP. The North has never officially stated how Jang was executed, although multiple reports say an anti-aircraft gun was used. Trump’s account is the first from any senior official to mention decapitation. Nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington have been at a standstill since the collapse of the Hanoi summit last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.

Top Belarus activist says authorities threatened to kill her,"  A prominent opposition activist who resisted her forcible expulsion from Belarus by ripping up her passport accused Belarusian authorities Thursday of threatening to kill her amid their efforts to end a month of protests against the country’s authoritarian president. Maria Kolesnikova said in a formal complaint released by her lawyer that agents of Belarus’ state security committee put a bag on her head and drove her to the border with Ukraine before she fought her removal from Belarus and was jailed. “They threatened to kill me,” Kolesnikova said. “They stated that if I refuse to leave the territory of Belarus voluntarily, they will get me out of the country anyway - alive or in fragments.” She demanded that the nation’s Investigative Committee probe the KGB officers on charges of abduction, illegal detention and threats of killing. Opposition activists came under increasing pressure this week as Belarus marked a month since massive demonstrations broke out against President Alexander Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term. The opposition rejects the results of the country’s Aug. 9 election, and the protesters demanding Lukashenko’s resignation represent an unprecedented challenge to the Belarusian leader’s 26-year rule. Kolesnikova is a leading member of the Coordination Council created by opposition activists to push for a new election. She was detained Monday and destroyed her passport in a no-man’s land between Ukraine and Belarus the next day to prevent her expulsion. Kolesnikova, who remains jailed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, is accused of undermining national security as part of a criminal probe against senior members of the opposition Coordination Council. She faces up to five years in prison, if convicted. All of the council’s senior members except for Nobel Prize-winning writer Svetlana Alexievich have been jailed or forcibly expelled from the country.          ",world

Vaccine still possible by yr-end despite trial pause: AstraZeneca,"  Drugs giant AstraZeneca on Thursday said a Covid-19 vaccine could still be available by as early as the end of the year, despite a randomised clinical trial being paused. “We could still have a vaccine by the end of this year, early next year,” the UK-based company’s chief executive Pascal Soriot said in comments at a media event. AstraZeneca announced Wednesday it had “voluntarily paused” its trial of a drug developed alongside Oxford University after a UK volunteer developed an unexplained illness. An independent committee was drafted in to review safety but the company said it was a “routine action” designed to maintain the integrity of the trials. “We will be guided by this committee as to when the trials could restart, so that we can continue our work at the earliest opportunity,” Soriot said in a statement. AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is one of nine around the world currently in late-stage Phase 3 human trials. In the US, the company began enrolling 30,000 volunteers across dozens of sites on August 31, and smaller groups are being tested in Brazil and elsewhere in South America. The vaccine, called AZD1222, uses a weakened version of a common cold-causing adenovirus engineered to code for the spike protein that the novel coronavirus uses to invade cells. After vaccination, this protein is produced inside the human body, which primes the immune system to attack the coronavirus if the person is later infected. The director of UK scientific research charity the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, said there were often pauses in vaccine trials. He told BBC radio in an interview that it demonstrated the importance of conducting vaccine trials properly, with independent oversight and the involvement of the regulator.     ",world
Biden’s campaign firm hit by Russian hackers: Report,"  Microsoft Corp recently alerted one of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms that it had been targeted by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to three people briefed on the matter. The hacking attempts targeted staff at Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats, over the past two months, the sources said. A person familiar with SKDK’s response to the attempts said the hackers failed to gain access to the firm’s networks. “They are well-defended, so there has been no breach,” the person said. SKDK Vice Chair Hilary Rosen declined to comment. A Biden spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The hacking attempts on SKDK come as U.S. intelligence agencies have raised alarms about possible efforts by foreign governments to interfere in the November presidential election. Investigations by former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate intelligence committee both concluded that affiliates of the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and Mueller has warned that Russia was meddling in the current campaign. One of the sources said it was not clear whether Biden’s campaign was the target or whether the Russians were attempting to gain access to information about other SKDK clients. SKDK managing director Anita Dunn was a White House communications director during the Barack Obama presidency and serves the Biden campaign as a senior advisor. The attempts to infiltrate SKDK were recently flagged to the campaign firm by Microsoft, which identified hackers tied to the Russian Government as the likely culprits, according to the three sources briefed on the matter.

Over 300 groups urge more scrutiny of China on human rights,"  More than 300 civil society groups including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Service for Human Rights are urging the United Nations to set up an international watchdog to address human rights violations by the Chinese government. In an open letter published Wednesday, the groups say they are seeking greater scrutiny of and response to violations in places like Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as beyond — such as through censorship, development that hurts the environment and the targeting of rights defenders. The call for the creation of an “ independent international mechanism”  to focus on China’s rights violations adds to recent international pressure on Beijing over its handling of issues like protests in Hong Kong and detention centers — what the government calls vocational or training centers — for Uighur Muslims and others in western Xinjiang region. “ China has systematically persecuted rights defenders in reprisal for their cooperation with UN human rights operations – torture, enforced disappearance, imprisonment, and stripping licenses from lawyers,”  said Renee Xia, director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, in a statement.

GOP portrays Kamala as anti-Catholic,"  Soon after Joe Biden tapped Kamala Harris as his running mate, some conservatives began trying to portray her as anti-Catholic — a line of attack that President Donald Trump’s campaign continues to amplify as Democrats court Roman Catholic voters. The charge stems in part from questions Harris posed in 2018 to a federal judicial nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a lay Catholic fraternal organisation. Harris asked the nominee if he agreed with the anti-abortion views of the group’s leader, views that broadly align with the church’s stance. It inflamed Republicans at the time, with one senator authoring a resolution to affirm the constitutional ban on religious tests for federal officials and state that membership in the Catholic group is not “ disqualifying.”  Now that Harris is Biden’s running mate, conservatives are replaying the moment to try to chip at the pro-abortion-rights Democratic ticket’s appeals to religious voters. As Biden’s campaign launched its Catholic voter outreach effort last week, the Trump campaign blasted Harris’ questioning as “ anti-Catholic bigotry”  and said the Democrats’ stance on abortion “ clashes strongly with Catholic pro-life beliefs.”  It used similar language to refer to Harris alongside an online ad it rolled out last month. The criticism of Harris, who attends a progressive Black Baptist church — and by extension, criticism of Biden — is a sign that Republicans see his leftward shift on abortion as a vulnerability with some devout swing voters who might otherwise be lukewarm on Trump, particularly Catholics and evangelicals. It also plays upon the fact that Harris’ approach to religious outreach is less fully formed than that of Biden, whose lifelong Catholic faith is a touchstone of his political identity. “ We hope that Biden and Kamala Harris talk a lot about these issues,”  said Richard Mouw, president emeritus at Fuller Theological Seminary, who signed a July letter from Christian leaders urging Democrats to take a friendlier stance toward abortion critics. “ Because even though some of us disagree about Biden’s policies related to these positions, we think he understands us.”  Mouw praised Harris’ selection, adding that he hopes to see signals from her that she’s ready to “ keep talking”  and “ keep listening”  to evangelicals and conservative Catholics disillusioned with Trump.

Rights group: Myanmar Army deserters confirmed atrocities,"  Two soldiers who deserted from Myanmar’s army have testified on video that they were instructed by commanding officers to “shoot all that you see and that you hear” in villages where minority Rohingya lived, a human rights group said Tuesday. The comments appear to be the first public confession by soldiers of involvement in army-directed massacres, rape and other crimes against Rohingya Muslims in the Buddhist-majority country. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh since August 2017 to escape what Myanmar’s military called a clearance campaign following an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group in Rakhine state. Myanmar’s government has denied accusations that security forces committed mass rapes and killings and burned thousands of homes. The group  said the two army privates fled the country last month and are believed to be in the custody of the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands, which is examining the violence against the Rohingya. Asked about the two soldiers, an ICC spokesman said Tuesday that “We have no new persons under arrest.” The two men “separately claimed to be acting on orders from senior commanders to ‘exterminate all (Rohingya),’ to ‘shoot all that you see and that you hear,’ and to ‘kill all’ Rohingya in specific areas,” Fortify Rights said in a statement.

Julian Assange told to stop interrupting witnesses at hearing,"  A British judge told WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Tuesday that his extradition hearing will proceed without him if he continues to speak from the dock and interrupt witnesses. Vanessa Baraitser briefly adjourned the hearing at London’s Central Criminal Court after Assange interrupted defense witness Clive Stafford Smith, who was giving evidence. Assange’s outburst couldn’t be heard by journalists following proceedings by video link. Assange is fighting an attempt by American prosecutors to extradite him to the US to stand trial on spying charges. US prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges over WikiLeaks’ publication of secret US military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison. Assange’s lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle media freedom and put journalists at risk around the world. Addressing Assange, the judge said: “You will hear things, no doubt many things, you disagree with during these proceedings.” “If you interrupt proceedings it is open to me to proceed in your absence,” she added. On Monday, when the hearing opened, Baraitser rejected requests by Assange’s lawyers to delay his extradition hearing until next year so they can have more time to respond to U.S. Allegations that he conspired with hackers to obtain classified information.

"Hospital: Alexei Navalny out of coma, is responsive","  Poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s condition has improved, allowing doctors to take him out of an induced coma, the German hospital treating him said Monday. Navalny, a fierce, high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany last month after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia. German chemical weapons experts say tests show the 44-year-old was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent, prompting the German government last week to demand that Russia investigate the case. “The patient has been removed from his medically induced coma and is being weaned off mechanical ventilation,” Berlin’s Charite hospital said in a statement. “He is responding to verbal stimuli. It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.” It added that the decision to publicly release details of his condition was made in consultation with Navalny’s wife. Navalny had been in an induced coma in the Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany on Aug. 22 for treatment. News of his gradual recovery came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office indicated that she might be willing to rethink the fate of a controversial German-Russian gas pipeline project — a sign of Berlin’s growing frustration over Moscow’s stonewalling about the case. German authorities said last week that tests showed “proof without doubt” that Navalny was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities identified the Soviet-era Novichok as the poison used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018. Russia has denied that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and accused Germany failing to provide evidence about the poisoning that it requested in late August. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Sunday that the Russian reaction could determine whether Germany changes its long-standing backing for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brings Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine.

Saudi court gives 7 yrs to 20 yrs jail for Khashoggi murder,"  A Saudi court issued final verdicts on Monday in the case of slain Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi after his family announced pardons that spared five of the convicted individuals from execution. Saudi Arabia’s state television aired few details about the final verdicts issued by the Riyadh Criminal Court against the eight Saudi nationals. Their names were not made public. The court ordered a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for five. Another received a 10-year sentence, and two others were ordered to serve seven years in prison. The trial was widely criticised by rights groups and an independent UN investigator, who noted that no senior officials nor anyone suspected of ordering the killing was found guilty. The independence of the court was also brought into question. Prior to his killing, Khashoggi had written critically of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in columns for the Washington Post. He’d been living in exile in the United States for about a year as Prince Mohammed oversaw a crackdown in Saudi Arabia on human rights activists, writers and critics of the kingdom’s devastating war in Yemen. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018 inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Among those ensnared in the killing are a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office. The crown prince has denied any knowledge of the operation.  ",world
We do have 2 systems of justice in US: Harris,"  The US has two systems of justice for Black and White Americans, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said, as the Indian-origin Senator rebuked President Donald Trump and his Attorney General for denying there is systemic racism in the country’s justice system. The strong criticism from Harris, the first Black and Indian-American woman on a major party vice presidential ticket came less than two months before the US presidential election. Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Harris are challenging incumbent President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence of the Republican Party in the November 3 election. Harris, 55, strongly criticised President Trump and Attorney General William Barr for denying there is systemic racism in the US justice system, saying they are “spending full time in a different reality.” “The reality of America today is what we have seen over generations and, frankly, since our inception, which is, we do have two systems of justice in America,” Harris told CNN in an interview. But she said she was optimistic that as a nation, Americans hold dear to an ideal that is inscribed in marble on the Supreme Court, which is that ideal of equal justice under law. “And so, while we have two systems of justice, we also fight for equal justice under law. And that means doing what Joe Biden and I are proposing, which is having a criminal justice system that, yes, bans choke holds and carotid holds, make sure that we’re going to require accountability for police officers who break the rules and break the law.” Harris said their administration would invest in communities and the economic strength of those communities, but doing it all recognising that there are huge disparities in the country based on race. “And it does us no good if we want to solve those disparities to pretend they don’t exist,” she said. Harris also suggested that President Trump was not a “real leader” on racial justice and was trying to “pretend that he has been a leader” on the coronavirus pandemic. “I don’t think that most reasonable people who are paying attention to the facts would dispute that there are racial disparities and a system that has engaged in racism in terms of how the laws have been enforced,” said Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general.  “It does us no good to deny that. Let’s just deal with it. Let’s be honest. These might be difficult conversations for some, but they’re not difficult conversations for leaders, not for real leaders.” Barr, America’s top law enforcement official, dismissed the idea of “two justice systems” told CNN on Wednesday. “I think we have to be a little careful about throwing the idea of racism around,” he said. “I don’t think it is as common as people suggest.”              ",world

Iran airs televised confession of wrestler after Trump tweet,"  Iran has broadcast the televised confession of a wrestler facing the death penalty after a tweet from President Donald Trump criticising the case, a segment that resembled hundreds of other suspected coerced confessions aired over the last decade in the Islamic Republic. The case of 27-year-old Navid Afkari has drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrays him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran’s Shiite theocracy in 2018. The television segment and authorities accuse Afkari of stabbing a water supply company employee in the southern city of Shiraz amid the unrest. Afkari’s case has drawn international attention and revived a demand inside the country that Iran, one of the world’s top executioners, stop carrying out the death penalty.

FBI security experts advised him of best practices — walk around your car before entering, watch for unfamiliar vehicles in your neighborhood — more commonly associated with mob targets looking to elude detection. “Being subjected to outrageous attacks up to and including by the president himself, which are full of lies and mischaracterizations and just crude and cruel, is horrible,” Strzok told The Associated Press in an interview. “There’s no way around it.” A new book by Strzok traces his arc from veteran counterintelligence agent to the man who came to embody Trump’s public scorn of FBI and his characterization of its Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.”  ",world
"17 killed, 20 hurt as 6 air conditioners explode in Bangladesh mosque","  A gas leak in an underground pipeline caused six air conditioners to explode almost simultaneously in a mosque during Friday evening prayers on the outskirts of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, killing 17 people, including a child, and injuring 20 others. Worshippers were at Friday evening prayers when the blast sent a ball of flames through the Baitul Salat mosque in the central district of Narayanganj, officials said. At least 17 people including a seven-year old boy, succumbed to their injuries at Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgeryhere, the Dhaka Tribune reported. About 20 victims are undergoing treatment at the hospital and are stated to be in critical condition. Fire officials suspect accumulated gas from a leaked pipeline triggered a spark and all six air conditioners on the ground floor of the mosque exploded. “A gas pipeline passes beneath the mosque. We are suspecting that gas leaked from the pipeline and accumulated inside as the windows were closed. The explosion was probably triggered due to sparks when someone tried to switch on or off the ACs or fans,” Narayanganj Fire Service’s Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Arefin was quoted as saying by the newspaper. According to reports, the mosque committee had recently filed a complaint over leakage of the gas pipeline of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited. Narayanganj Fire Service and police have already initiated investigation into the blast while the company formed another probe body to look into the incident. Narayanganj Superintendent of Police (SP) Md Zayedul Alam visited the victims at the institute and said action will be taken if they found evidence of negligence against anyone in its inquiry. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed concern over the incident and issued directions to ensure all possible medical care for the victims.

Racial tensions roiling US pose target for election meddling,"  The tensions coursing through the United States over racism and policing are likely targets for adversaries seeking to influence the November election, lawmakers and experts warn — and there are signs that Russia is again seeking to exploit the divide. Earlier this year, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pulled down dozens of accounts with names like “Blacks Facts Untold” that had been followed or liked by hundreds of thousands of people. The accounts were fake, created by an organization in Africa with links to Russia’s Internet Research Agency. Similarly, this past week Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts linked to that “troll factory” that had pushed out stories about race and other issues. The network had tricked unwitting American writers to post content to the pages. It’s a troubling but familiar pattern from Russia, as the Internet Research Agency overwhelmingly focused on race and the Black Lives Matter Movement when targeting the U.S. in 2016. The goal, part of the Russian playbook for decades, was to sow chaos by posting content on both sides of the racial divide. Indeed, “no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans,” concluded a report from the Senate Intelligence Committee. With the election just two months away, some lawmakers are worried that the Russian efforts, now evolved and more sophisticated than four years ago, could again take hold. They fear the Trump administration’s decision to  limit what it tells Congress — and by extension the American people — about election threats will allow the propaganda to spread.  ",world

They’re very good young people. And I know their relationship to India is very good and so is mine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. The President, who describes himself as the best friend ever of India and Indian Americans in the White House, was responding to a question about the role the three important members of his family are going to play this election cycle along with respect to the Indian American community. “Would Kimberly, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump, who are very popular among Indian Americans, would be campaigning on your behalf among the Indian Americans with your views on India-US relationship?” the president was asked. “I appreciate the nice sentiments. They think (Kimberley, Don Jr and Ivanka) a lot of India and so do I. And think a lot of your prime minister (Narendra Modi),” Trump said in response to the question. In the 2016 elections, the Trump family had reached out to the Indian American community, particularly in the battleground states of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida where both Ivanka, and Donald Trump Jr along with his other son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara Trump held meetings with the community members and visited Hindu temples. Ivanka, was the first member of the Trump family to make a trip to India after Trump came to power. She led a high-powered US delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India in 2017. Ivanka, frequently tweets about issues related to India. Having a star appeal in India, Ivanka is also special advisor to the president. Donald Trump Jr, who is heading the re-election campaign, has also made trips to India. Last December he held a special book-launch event for Indian American community in Long Island.  ",world
Will sanction Chinese officials for rights abuse in Tibet: Biden,"  Slamming China’s plan to further tighten control over Tibet, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that if voted to power, his administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in the remote Himalayan region. Noting that the Chinese Government recently announced plans to further tighten control over Tibet, thereby continuing to erode the human rights, religious freedoms, and dignity of the Tibetan people, the former US vice president said that these are only the latest efforts by Beijing to crush ethnic minorities that seek to preserve their distinct culture, language and beliefs. “My administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet, and step up support for the Tibetan people, including by expanding Tibetan language services at Radio Free Asia and Voice of America to get information from the outside world into Tibet,” Biden said. Biden vowed that as president he will meet with the Dalai Lama, appoint a new Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, and insist that the Chinese government restore access to Tibet for US citizens, including American diplomats and journalists. “Where (President Donald) Trump has turned a blind eye, a Biden-Harris administration will stand up for the people of Tibet,” Biden said. In his statement, Biden alleged that Trump has been weak on his China policy. “Once again, the silence from President Trump has been deafening, as he focuses instead on his empty trade deal with Beijing and protecting his ‘very good friendship’ with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It’s disgraceful, though not surprising, that Trump is the first American president in three decades who has not met or spoken with His Holiness the Dalai Lama,” he said. “Trump hasn’t even fulfilled the statutory requirement to appoint a Special Coordinator to lead America’s efforts on this vital issue. It’s no wonder China’s leaders believe they have a free hand to deepen repression in Tibet, just as they have in Hong Kong and Xinjiang,” Biden said.             ",world

B’desh court: Hindu widows to get share of husbands' properties,"  For the first time, Hindu widows in Bangladesh will have the rights to both agricultural and non-agricultural lands of their deceased husbands after a top court ruled in their favour, according to a media report. The Bangladesh High Court on Wednesday ruled that no separation has been made between the agricultural and non-agricultural lands. So Hindu widows have the rights to the lands of their husbands, The Daily Star reported. Under the current norm, Hindu widows in the country are only entitled to their spouses' homesteads and not any other assets like agricultural land. ""Hindu widows will have the rights to both agricultural and non-agricultural lands that belonged to their husbands. They will also get the right to sell the lands for legal necessities during their lifetime,"" the report said, citing the court order. The verdict by the High Court came following a civil revision petition filed by civilian Jyotindranath Mondal from Khulna district challenging a lower court verdict.

The land had been recorded in the name of Gouri after Avimannu died in 1996.

Taiwan denounces China’s ‘vulgar threats’ towards Czech Republic speaker,"  China’s “vulgar threats” over a visit by the Czech Republic’s senate speaker to Taiwan are like a cold, unwelcome winter wind and contrast with the courteous words the speaker offered while in Taiwan, a senior Taiwanese politician said on Thursday.

Putin’s critic poisoned with chemical nerve agent: Germany,"  Tests carried out on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny showed that he was poisoned by a Novichok chemical nerve agent, the German government said Wednesday, demanding explanations from Moscow. “It is a shocking event that Alexei Navalny has become the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia,” said government spokesman Steffen Seibert in a statement. “The government condemns this attack in the strongest terms. The Russian government is urgently requested to provide clarifications over the incident.” Tests carried out by the German army in consultation with the Charite hospital in Berlin, where Navalny is being treated, had found “unequivocal evidence of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok family,” Seibert said. Navalny, 44, fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia last month. He was initially treated in a local hospital before being flown to Berlin for treatment.

Saudi allows overflights by UAE to all countries,"  Saudi Arabia has agreed to allow UAE flights to “all countries” to overfly the kingdom, state media reported Wednesday, days after allowing an Israeli aircraft to pass over en route to Abu Dhabi. Saudi Arabia has accepted an Emirati request to allow “crossing the kingdom’s airspace for flights heading to the UAE and departing from it to all countries”, the official Saudi Press Agency said, citing a source from the civil aviation authority. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile announced that Monday’s historic first commercial flight of an Israeli aircraft direct to the United Arab Emirates across Saudi Arabia would not be the last. “Israeli planes and those from all countries will be able to fly directly from Israel to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and back,” Netanyahu said, without giving any timeline. The announcements come after a US-Israeli delegation visited Abu Dhabi on Monday, on the first direct commercial flight from Tel Aviv to mark the normalisation of ties between the Jewish state and the UAE. Saudi Arabia has said it will not follow the United Arab Emirates in establishing diplomatic ties with Israel until the Jewish state has signed an internationally recognised peace accord with the Palestinians. But the kingdom has cultivated clandestine relations with Israel in recent years, in a shift spearheaded by de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In a sign of its cooperation with Israel, Saudi Arabia allowed Monday’s historic flight to cross its airspace, halving what would otherwise have been a long detour around the Arabian peninsula. However, Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s biggest economy and home to Islam’s holiest sites, faces more sensitive political calculations than the UAE. Not only would a formal recognition of Israel be seen by Palestinians and their supporters as a betrayal of their cause, it would also hurt the kingdom’s image as the leader of the Islamic world.

"After blasting Trump on violence, Biden now turns to schools","  Joe Biden plans to hammer President Donald Trump on Wednesday for not helping the nation’s schools reopen safely during the coronavirus pandemic, as the Democratic challenger tries to keep the spotlight on the Republican incumbent’s handling of the outbreak and the nation’s overall security. Biden and his wife, Jill, a longtime college professor and former high school teacher, will meet with public health experts to talk about school reopening options. Then the candidate will deliver remarks – his second speech in three days – outlining his ideas and accusing the president of making the country less safe. The event in Wilmington, Delaware, is the latest in a series of dueling efforts by Trump and Biden to cast the other as a threat to Americans’ day-to-day security. It will highlight their vastly different arguments, with Trump steering debate toward “law and order” and Biden pushing a broad referendum on Trump’s competence. “President Trump has no plan,” said Biden adviser Symone Sanders, previewing the former vice president’s remarks on schools and the pandemic. “Instead,” she continued, “he thinks that a fear-mongering campaign stoking violence is going to help him.” Biden, she said, “is demonstrating what a safe America could look like” by talking to experts about school options in a pandemic, while Trump tries to capitalize on the fact that some racial justice protests have led to property damage or turned into violent clashes with counter-protesters. Trump put his approach on display again Tuesday on a trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin, a city still reeling from protests and violence after another Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by police.  ",world
Pentagon: China eying India’s neighbourhood,"  China is seeking to set up more robust logistics facilities in about a dozen countries, including three in India’s neighbourhood, to allow the PLA to project and sustain military power at greater distances, according to a Pentagon report. In addition to the three neighbours of India -- Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar -- the other countries where China is considering to base its military logistics and infrastructure facilities are Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Seychelles, Tanzania, Angola and Tajikistan, the report said on Tuesday. In its annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 2020” that was submitted to the US Congress, the Pentagon said these potential Chinese military logistics facilities are in addition to the Chinese military base in Djibouti, which is aimed at supporting naval, air and ground forces projection. “A global PLA (People’s Liberation Army) military logistics network could both interfere with US military operations and support offensive operations against the United States as the PRC’s global military objectives evolve,” the Pentagon said in the report. China has probably already made overtures to Namibia, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, it said, adding the known focus areas of PLA planning are along the Seal Lines of Communication from China to the Strait of Hormuz, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Similarly, the Pentagon said, Beijing uses the One Belt One Road (OBOR) intitiative to support its strategy of national rejuvenation by seeking to expand global transportation and trade linkages to support its development and deepen its economic integration with nations along its periphery and beyond. “OBOR projects associated with pipelines and port construction in Pakistan intend to decrease China’s reliance on transporting energy resources through strategic chokepoints, such as the Strait of Malacca,” it said. China leverages the OBOR to invest in projects along China’s western and southern periphery to improve stability and diminish threats along its borders, the report said. First announced in 2013, China’s OBOR initiative is a signature foreign and economic policy advanced by President Xi Jinping.                 ",world
‘RBI’s new current account norms make foreign banks jittery’,"  The Reserve Bank’s new guidelines on current account have made the foreign banks jittery, as they will not be able to garner nil-interest funds from corporate in the name of providing better services than their domestic counterparts, said a senior banker.  As per the latest RBI guidelines, a bank opening a dedicated current account of any company with Rs 50 crore or more in debt must have at least 10 per cent loan exposure in the concerned business entity. Most foreign banks manage current accounts of corporate without providing any loan to them. So far, foreign banks used to manage the large current accounts of India Inc with virtually little or no exposure, the senior executive of a public sector bank said. Lending used to come from domestic banks but current account management were with foreign banks as they promised better services and other incentives, the banker added. Without having any liability, another banker said, foreign banks were managing large current accounts where interest outgo was nil but the latest guideline from the Reserve Bank of India will put a curb on this practice. Since public-sector banks do the bulk of corporate lending, they stand to gain from these guidelines on current accounts.On August 6, the RBI had observed that the checks and balances put in place in the existing framework for opening current accounts are inadequate.

Lebanon’s ambassador to Germany, Mustapha Adib, was expected to be named as prime minister-designate and asked to form a new government after winning the backing of major parties, including the crucial support of senior politicians from his own Sunni Muslim community. The consultations were being held hours before French President Emmanuel Macron was due to arrive for a two day-visit.               ",world
Baltic states impose sanctions against Belarus ahead of EU,"  The three Baltic countries on Monday slapped their own travel sanctions on 30 top officials in Belarus, including President Alexander Lukashenko, in response to a brutal crackdown against protesters who say the Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus was rigged. Those on the list are banned from entering Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, according to the document signed by the three Baltic nations’ interior ministers. “New people will be added to the list in the future.” said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. The move comes as the EU is planning its own sanctions list of up to 20 senior Belarus officials suspected of election fraud and the crackdown on protesters and is likely to put Lukashenko on that list at some point. All three Baltic nations are members of the EU.                ",world
Anyone challenging one-China policy will pay heavy price: FM,"  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday warned that anyone challenging the ‘one-China’ policy will pay a heavy price as he termed a top Czech Republic official’s visit to Taiwan as a provocation and short-sighted move. The Chinese government is under increased pressure over Taiwan after the recent visit of US Health Service Secretary Alex Azar to Taipei, the first high-ranking American official to visit the estranged island which China claims as part of its mainland. Azar, who is the highest-ranking Cabinet member to visit Taiwan since the US switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, visited Taiwan in the second week of this month and met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, a staunch proponent of Taiwan’s independence from China. Azar’s visit was regarded as the major diplomatic setback for Beijing which asserts that the ‘one-China’ policy constitutes the core of its foreign policy recognised by all the countries which have established diplomatic relations with it. After Azar, Czech Republic Senate Speaker Milos Vystrcil started his visit to Taiwan from Sunday, ignoring Beijing’s prior warnings and met top Taiwanese officials. China’s state-run Global Times said Vystrci went ahead with the visit despite the opposition from the Czech president Milos Zeman. Wang, who was in Germany on Monday as part of his visit to the European Union countries, said Beijing will not tolerate the violation of its one-China policy. He said that anyone who challenges the one-China principle will pay a heavy price, referring to the Czech senate speaker’s Taiwan visit, the report said. Wang said Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, noting that to challenge the one-China principle over the Taiwan issue is to make an enemy of 1.4 billion Chinese people and is a violation of international trust and conduct. Calling Vystrcil’s visit to Taiwan a provocation, Wang stressed that the Chinese government and people will not sit idly when challenged by the anti-China power and will let him pay a heavy price for the short-sighted move and political speculation. Responding to questions on Wang’s remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on Monday that the anti-China forces in the Czech republic deliberately impinge upon China’ sovereignty and blatantly interfere in China’s internal affairs.

First direct flight lands in Abu Dhabi,"  In a historic step towards peace in the Middle East, the first commercial direct flight between Israel and the UAE landed in Abu Dhabi on Monday after both countries announced normalisation of relations.  The flight carried a top level Israeli delegation led by National Security Adviser Meir Ben Shabbat while the US delegation was headed by US President Donald Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and US National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien. The delegation left aboard the commercial El Al flight 971 that took off from Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv at 11.21am local time. The word peace was painted on it in Arabic, English and Hebrew above a cockpit window. “We just completed a truly historic flight. This hopefully will be the first of many,” Kushner said after disembarking from the flight. He thanked leadership on both sides on the occasion. Saudi Arabia granted permission for the use of its air space. “Peace overwhelmingly desired by the people, except by those who exploit misery to remain in power. Future belongs to industrious people of the region,” Kushner said. Israel and the UAE announced on August 13 that they were establishing full diplomatic relations, in a US-brokered deal that required Israel to suspend its plan to annex parts of the West Bank. UAE is only the third Arab country to establish diplomatic ties with the Jewish state. Israel’s neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, being the other two Arab states to recognise the Jewish state.  ",world

Lebanese Hezbollah says it’s open to reformist Government,"  The head of Lebanon’s Hezbollah said on Sunday his group supports the formation of a government that would be able to improve economic conditions in the crisis-stricken country and undertake major reforms. Hassan Nasrallah said his group is also open to calls from France for a new political contract in Lebanon, on condition that all Lebanese sects are on board. The speech came on the eve of a meeting by Lebanese parliamentary blocs deciding to name a new prime minister and also ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s arrival in Lebanon late Monday. It’s Macron’s second visit to the former French protectorate in less than a month. Macron has offered French support after the devastating Aug. 4 port explosion in Beirut and has also pressed Lebanese officials to formulate a new political pact to lift the country out of its political stalemates, entrenched corruption and years of mismanagement. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, which has a dominant role in Lebanon’s politics, has come under intense criticism and public scrutiny as the country faces multiple devastating crises. The port explosion killed 190 people and injured over 6,000. Parts of the capital were devastated and the port, a main trade channel for the small country dependent on imports, was badly damaged.        ",world
"1 die in Trump fans, BLM clash","  One person was shot and killed late Saturday in Portland, Oregon, as a large caravan of President Donald Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the streets, police said. It wasn’t clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as a caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by protesters in the city’s downtown. An Associated Press freelance photographer heard three gunshots and then observed police medics working on the body of the victim, who appeared to be a white man. “Portland Police officers heard sounds of gunfire from the area of Southeast 3rd Avenue and Southwest Alder Street. They responded and located a victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. Medical responded and determined that the victim was deceased,” the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement. Police did not release any additional details and were at the scene investigating late Saturday. Portland has been the site of nightly protests for more than three months since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Many of them end in vandalism and violence, and hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested by local and federal law enforcement since late May. The caravan arrived downtown just as a protest planned for Saturday was getting underway. Police made several arrests before the shooting and advised residents to avoid the city core. The chaotic scene came two days after Trump invoked Portland as a liberal city overrun with violence in a speech at the Republican National Convention as part of his “law and order” re-election campaign theme. The caravan marked the third Saturday in a row that Trump supporters have rallied in the city. Trump and other speakers at this week’s convention evoked a violent, dystopian future if Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden wins in November and pointed to Portland as a cautionary tale for what would be in store for Americans. The pro-Trump rally’s organiser, who coordinated a similar caravan in Boise, Idaho, earlier in the week, said in a video posted on Twitter Saturday afternoon that attendees should only carry concealed weapons and the route was being kept secret for safety reasons. The caravan had gathered earlier in the day at a suburban mall and drove as a group to the heart of Portland. As they arrived in the city, protesters attempted to stop them by standing in the street and blocking bridges. Videos from the scene showed sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counter-protesters threw things at the Trump caravan. The shooting happened shortly before 9 pm Pacific, several hours after the caravan began arriving in Portland.             ",world

"Divisions emerge between Mali junta, opp leaders","  Bamako: Tensions mounted on Saturday between Mali’s military junta and the country’s longtime political opposition after the coup leaders failed to invite prominent opposition figures to a planned forum on the country’s political future. The meeting ultimately was cancelled and the junta leadership instead met with imam Mahmoud Dicko, an opposition leader who on Friday urged the junta to speed up the transition to civilian rule so the West African country could avoid further crushing financial sanctions. “I ask them to be part of the solution and not another problem,” he said. Only a week earlier, the opposition coalition known as M5-RFP that includes Dicko had publicly backed the coup, with thousands of their supporters taking to the streets after the junta’s overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. M5-RFP had led several months of demonstrations calling for his resignation three years before his final term was due to end. In a statement late Friday, one M5-RFP leader said the alliance regretted not being invited to take part in Saturday’s planned discussions between the junta and various political actors.

UAE formally ends Israel boycott law allowing economic agreements,"  The president of the United Arab Emirates has issued a decree cancelling a law on boycotting Israel and allowing trade and financial agreements between the two countries, the UAE official news agency WAM reported on Saturday. The decree from UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan aims at “supporting bilateral cooperation in order to arrive at (the establishment) of bilateral relations”, the agency said. The announcement comes as El Al Airlines plans to operate Israel’s first direct flight between Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport and the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi, carrying an Israeli delegation and top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump, who brokered an Aug. 13 accord to normalise Israel-UAE ties. Trump’s senior adviser Jared Kushner will be among the U.S. officials on the El Al flight departing on Aug. 31 at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), a U.S official said. The Israel-UAE deal awaits negotiations on details such as opening embassies, trade and travel links before it is officially signed. There are no official air links between Israel and the UAE, and it was unclear whether El Al would be able to fly over Saudi Arabia, which has no official ties with Israel, to cut down on flight time. In May, an Etihad Airways plane flew from the UAE to Tel Aviv to deliver supplies to the Palestinians to use for the novel coronavirus epidemic, marking the first known flight by a UAE carrier to Israel.

"Kamala Harris pledges to rejoin Paris climate pact, re-enter Iran nuke deal","  Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, the US Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and re-enter the Iran nuclear deal to restore “our place in the world” and win back the “trust and support” of the US’s Asian and European allies if her party wins the November presidential election. Kamala Harris, 55, is the running mate of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. At a virtual fundraiser on Friday, she was asked how a Biden-Harris administration would restore the “trust and support of our European and Asian allies.” In response, Kamala Harris slammed President Donald Trump and pledged to “rejoin” the Paris agreement on Climate Change and “strengthen and re-enter” the Iran nuclear deal. “Joe Biden and our administration is gonna have a massive job to repair the damage done by Donald Trump and his administration, and to restore our place in the world,” she said. In 2017, Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries. In 2018, Trump pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Part of our strength when, when we as a country, historically, walk into that room around the globe. Part of the strength of our standing it’’s not just about our military it’s not just about our economic strength. It’s about the fact that folks believe that when we say something we mean it,” the Senator from California said. “We are loyal to our friends that we keep our word, including when we make commitments, be it to NATO or to the Paris agreement that we will follow through. And Donald Trump, he just doesn’t get it. I mean it’s such an extension of his character as a human being I believe that he doesn’t understand the importance of integrity and consistency in one’’s word,” Ms Harris said.  ",world

Now more than ever, America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House,” 38-year-old Ivanka said in her address to the Republican National Convention on Thursday from the South Lawn of the White House. “Tonight, I stand before you as the proud daughter of the people’s president. He’s our commander-in-chief, champion of the American workers, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. He is our president, and my father, Donald J Trump,” she said amidst loud cheer from the Republican Party supporters.              ",world
Trump has shown reckless disregard for wellbeing of American people: Kamala,"   Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, has blasted President Donald Trump for failing to protect the American people from the deadly coronavirus pandemic by being “fixated on the stock market” and caving in to China. In a blistering speech hours before Trump delivered his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention from the South Lawn at the White House, Harris alleged that the president’s policies have been “a reckless disregard” for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. “Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people,” Harris said. With the Republican leaders attending the four-day convention largely downplaying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed over 180,000 people and infected over five million others in the US, Harris pointed out that Trump’s failure to address the health emergency more aggressively is emblematic of a tweet-driven presidency. “Here’s what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic: It’s relentless. You can’t stop it with the tweet,” the 55-year-old Senator from California told Trump. Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Trump froze and was scared. And he was petty and vindictive, she said. She said Trump “doesn’t understand the presidency” and believes it is “all about him.” The Republican convention is designed for one purpose: To soothe the president’s Trump’s ego, to make him feel good, Harris said.

Biden will be destroyer of American greatness: Trump’,"  Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden’s record as a “shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals” and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness. Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration. Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: “Joe Biden is not the saviour of America’s soul.” “He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.” “Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,” Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election. “Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,” Trump alleged. During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered. “This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,” he said.     ",world
China warns Norway against Peace Prize for HK activists,"  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, on a rare visit to Norway, warned Oslo against granting the Nobel Peace Prize to Hong Kong pro-democracy activists much on the lines of awarding the prize to China’s human rights activist Liu Xiaobo and Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the past, causing strains in bilateral ties. Wang, who is currently on a tour of European Union countries to shore-up support for China in the face of the increasing pressure mounted by the US, is the first Chinese Foreign Minister to visit Oslo in 15 years. Relations between China and the US are at an all-time low over the coronavirus pandemic and strained trade ties. The two countries also recently closed each other’s consulates in Houston and Chengdu. Wang’s visit comes in the backdrop of Norway preparing to take up a rotational seat on the United Nations Security Council, of which China is a permanent member. Wang also held talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide on Thursday. Later, when asked during media interaction on how China would react if the Nobel prize would go to Hong Kong protesters in future, Wang said “I would only say one thing: In the past, today, and in future, China will firmly reject any attempt by anyone to use the Nobel Peace Prize to interfere in China’s internal affairs”. “China is rock firm on this principle. We don’t want to see anyone politicise the Nobel Peace Prize,” the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted him as saying. He called on Norway to cherish the current relationship, saying “If we can continue to respect each other and treat each other as equals … our bilateral relationship can continue to develop in a sustained and sound manner, and the political foundation of the bilateral relationship can be further consolidated.” Both officials stressed that this was the first visit to Norway by a Chinese foreign minister in 15 years – a subtle reference to the previously frozen diplomatic relationship between 2010 and 2016, after the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee awarded the prize to Chinese dissident Liu, the Post report said. China was also cut up with the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama in 1989. Till 2012, the Nobel Prize was viewed with contempt by China and its official media as it was awarded to the Dalai Lama for his peaceful struggle for the betterment of Tibetans and to Liu. However, Beijing welcomed the Nobel Prize for literature to Chinese writer Mo Yan in 2012, saying that Mo’s “victory reflects the prosperity and progress of Chinese literature, as well as the increasing influence of China”.

Training her gun at the Trump Administration on the matter, the Indian-origin Senator said, “That nuclear deal, as we all know, blocked Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon and it was working, as was verified by international inspectors and the US intelligence community. But Donald Trump withdrew from it...promising a better deal and a cowed Iran, but instead Iran is revving up its nuclear activity and becoming more provocative.”  ",world
WHO warns of risk of young infecting the old,"   The World Health Organization’s chief for Europe has warned COVID-19 is a “tornado with a long tail” and says increased case counts among young people could ultimately passed on to more vulnerable older people and cause an uptick in deaths. Dr. Hans Kluge said younger people are likely to come into closer contact with the elderly as the weather cools in Europe. “We don’t want to do unnecessary predictions, but this is definitely one of the options: That at one point there would be more hospitalizations and an uptick in mortality,” he told reporters from Copenhagen, the WHO Europe headquarters. Kluge said 32 out of 55 state parties and territories in WHO’s European region have seen a 14-day incidence rate increase of more than 10 per cent, calling that “definitely an uptick which is generalized in Europe.”          ",world
"New federal virus testing advice sparks criticism, confusion","  US health officials sparked criticism and confusion after posting guidelines on coronavirus testing from the White House task force that run counter to what scientists say is necessary to control the pandemic. The new guidance says it’s not necessary for people who have been in close contact with infected people, but don’t feel sick, to get tested. It was posted earlier this week on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC previously had advised local health departments to test people who have been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. Across the country, public health experts called the change bizarre. They noted that testing contacts of infected people is a core element of public health efforts to keep outbreaks in check, and that a large percentage of infected people — the CDC has said as many as 40% — exhibit no symptoms.

Hat-trick hero Havertz,"  Frank Lampard said Kai Havertz is just getting started after opening his Chelsea account with a hat-trick in a 6-0 thrashing of Barnsley, while Arsenal also booked their place in the League Cup fourth round with a 2-0 win at Leicester. Havertz had struggled to make an impact in his first two Premier League games since sealing a reported $94 million move from Bayer Leverkusen as the most expensive signing of Chelsea’s £200 million spending spree in the transfer market.  But the 21-year-old German was one of just three players to retain his place from Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to Liverpool and Lampard’s decision reaped its reward as he scored his first senior hat-trick. “I am delighted with Kai, it was everything I wanted from him,” said Lampard. “He had no pre-season so I wanted to give him more time on the pitch with his teammates, learning how we play and press. It was a great night for Kai and it is the first of many for him.” Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell also made their Chelsea debuts, while Tammy Abraham and Ross Barkley made the most of rare starts to get their names on the scoresheet. Abraham pounced on loose pass deep in the Barnsley half to slam home the opener before Havertz’s calm finish opened his Chelsea account. A brilliant unselfish flick from Abraham teed Havertz up perfectly to convert his second after Barkley drove home on his weaker left foot.  Havertz was due to be replaced by Chilwell 25 minutes from time but just completed his hat-trick in time by rounding Brad Collins before tapping into an empty net before Olivier Giroud completed the scoring. “I am very happy to score three goals, but this is just my beginning at the club and I want to score more and more goals,” said Havertz. Arsenal won the only all-Premier League tie of the night as Christian Fuchs’s own goal broke the deadlock at the King Power. Eddie Nketiah added a late second for the Gunners, who could face Liverpool at Anfield twice in three days next week should the Premier League champions progress past Lincoln. Everton continued their fine start to the season with a 5-2 win at League One Fleetwood despite two howlers from England number one goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. Also, Newcastle thrashed League Two Morecombe 7-0.  ",sports
Modi asks Kohli about Yo-Yo test,"  Skipper Virat Kohli explained how the Yo-Yo test helped Indian cricketers aim for high-level fitness when Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him about the mandatory running aerobic fitness routine. Prime Minister Modi was interacting with fitness experts and influencers from across the country to mark the one-year anniversary of the Fit India Movement. Modi was keen to know what is Yo-Yo test and asked if the captain also has to pass it or he gets spared? “I heard these days there is a Yo-Yo test for the team, what is this test,” asked Modi during the virtual interaction. Kohli, smiling, replied, “This Test was very important from fitness point of view. If we talk about global fitness level, our fitness level is still low compared to other teams and we want to take it up, which is a basic requirement.” The gruelling routine has two sets of cones that are 20 metres apart. Once the beep is sounded, the athlete has to reach the marker on the other side by the time the next beep sounds, turn and get back to where he started before the third beep. The frequency of the beeps gradually increases for the subsequent runs. Kohli, who is currently in the UAE for the IPL, said even he has to clear the test to get selected for the India team. “I’m the one who goes to run first and this is the condition that if I fail that I am also not available for selection. It is important to set that culture and it will lead to improvement in overall fitness levels.”  ",sports
‘Professor Deano’ dies of cardiac arrest,"  Former Australia batsman Dean Jones, one of the finest exponents of ODI cricket, died of a sudden cardiac arrest in Mumbai on Thursday. Jones, 59, was in Mumbai with the Star Sports’ commentary team for the Indian Premier League. He was in a bio-bubble in a city hotel. He is survived by his wife and two daughters. Jones played 52 Tests and 164 ODIs for Australia and was part of the 1987 World Cup winning team. “It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing away of Mr Dean Mervyn Jones AM. He died of a sudden cardiac arrest,” Star Sports said a press release. “We express our deep condolences to his family and stand ready to support them in this difficult time. We are in touch with the Australian High Commission to make the necessary arrangements,” the release added. According to an IPL source, it happened in matter of seconds. “Deano was standing in the hotel lobby and he suddenly collapsed. Brett Lee was standing by his side. Brett tried to revive him by applying CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) but he didn’t respond,” said the source. “He was then taken to Harkisan Das Hospital in Girgaon where he was announced dead on arrival.” Jones’ family is in Melbourne and the Australian High Commission is in touch with them. A player well ahead of his time, Jones scored over 6068 ODI  runs at an average of 44.61 with seven hundred and 46 fifties. For Indian fans, he will forever remain in their memory for the historic tied Test in Chepauk, where he laid the foundation of a big Australian score with an unbeaten double hundred in challenging conditions. There was an iconic picture of Jones throwing up while batting and so severely dehydrated he was that he had to be admitted to a hospital during the course of the Test match. In ODI cricket and those numerous World Series Cup matches on Australia’s Channel 9, Jones, clad in yellow jersey and the lips lined with zinc cream is still etched in memories of the late 80s and early 90s generation. In ODI cricket, he would often charge down the track against fast bowlers and hitting them over in-field. He played a match winning knock against India in the 1992 World Cup in Brisbane, a thriller that India lost by one run. In his post retirement life he performed the role of a cricket analyst for various channels, primarily in South Asia — India and Pakistan, where he was immensely popular. One of the Indian news channel named him Professor Deano, a moniker that stuck with him and was also his Twitter handle. He could polarise opinion and would often get trolled. He also once courted controversy for calling Hashim Amla “terrorist” on air, a light-hearted comment but the racist undertone forced the particular broadcaster to take him off air. His online banter with fellow commentator and Trans Tasman all-rounder Scott Styris was enjoyed and lapped up by new generation of cricket followers.  ",sports

But yes, if he is not fit to play tomorrow, we have Amit Mishra who is a very experienced player, and has been doing well in the IPL.” Kaif said that Ishant “was sprinting well and is currently under observation”. “Our team physio has been keeping a close eye on him and we will also take a call today after our practice session in the evening,” said the 39-year-old.   difficult to bat for long duration Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma admitted that sapping condition in the UAE makes it difficult to bat for long duration and that's the reason he felt a bit tired by the end of his match-winning knock against KKR. “It is not easy to play long innings here. It takes a lot out of you to play in these conditions. Maybe I was a bit tired in the end and it was a lesson for us that one set batsmen needs to bat deep till the end,” Rohit said. “We've seen it in the past and that's what I tried to do.” While the heat and humidity made it difficult but it was imperative to bat as long as possible after a six-month break, Rohit said. “I haven't played a lot of cricket in the last six months time and was looking to spend some time in the middle; it didn't come out well in the first innings but glad to have done it tonight.”  ",sports
Youth vs Experience,"  Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s much-awaited promotion in the batting order will be an area of interest when Chennai Super Kings strive to pick up pieces against a confident Delhi Capitals in their third IPL encounter on Friday. The shock defeat against Rajasthan Royals on a batting belter at Sharjah could be primarily attributed to a poor show by their spinners along with a disastrous 20th over but the batsmen can’t absolve themselves completely, especially Murali Vijay, Kedar Jadhav and the skipper himself. Dhoni had come in to bat at number seven, promoting the likes of Sam Curran, Jadhav and Ruturaj Gaikwad ahead of himself but the ploy backfired badly leaving Faf du Plessis with too much work in too little time. While his fans still swear by his six-hitting ability, a closer look would show that Dhoni is unable to change the gears against express pace and it was only when Tom Curran came with his medium fast, Dhoni launched an attack. That too when the match as a contest was over. However on a big Dubai ground with bigger-sized boundaries, the skipper can rotate the strike better unlike Sharjah and also take those extra deliveries to settle down. For Delhi Capitals, winning a cliffhanger right at the onset would have given them a lot of confidence even though Ravichandran Ashwin’s probable absence after a shoulder injury could force them to reshuffle their bowling line-up. Senior spinner Amit Mishra could be an option to partner Axar Patel in case Ashwin is unable to make it. The cushion of bigger boundaries can always help a wrist spinner attack more by tossing the ball up. Another aspect will be pacer Mohit Sharma’s performance. While Mohit got KL Rahul at the beginning but his loose deliveries at the back-end made things difficult for the Capitals even as Kagiso Rabada bowled tightly at one end. Against a side like CSK which revels in attacking the last 10 overs, the Capitals might like to try Harshal Patel, who is also a handy batsman at any number having opened in domestic cricket. This is if Ishant Sharma, who is still nursing an ankle injury is available. Anrich Nortje in his first IPL game wasn’t bad but left-armer Daniel Sams could create those awkward angles that batsmen dislike. Shimron Hetmyer is likely to get one more chance unless Ricky Ponting wants to bring in some stability in the form of Alex Carey.  ",sports

14-day quarantine didn’t help: MS,"  The extended two-week quarantine of Chennai Super Kings hampered his preparations as he did not get enough time for batting practice, said captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni after his side lost to Rajasthan Royals by 16 runs in their second IPL game. Dhoni came in to bat at No 7, sending the likes of Sam Curran and Kedar Jadhav ahead of him in a mammoth 217-run chase on Tuesday. Asked why he came so low in the order, the CSK captain said, “I haven’t batted for a long time. 14-day quarantine doesn’t help.” “Also, we wanted to try different things, give opportunities to Sam (Curran). We have the opportunity to try different things. If they don’t work, you can always go back to your strengths,” the CSK skipper said. Dhoni’s reference was to CSK’s extra one-week quarantine after 13 people in their contingent tested positive for Covid-19, resulting in missing out on important training sessions. He was not out on 29 off 17 balls with three sixes in the last over. Although he didn’t name Murali Vijay but the veteran opener’s run-a-ball 21 was one of the reasons for CSK falling short besides an off-day from his spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Piyush Chawla. “With 217 on the board, we needed a very good start which was not the case. Steve (Smith) and (Sanju) Samson batted very well. We need to give credit to their bowlers. Once you’ve seen the first innings, you knew the lengths to bowl,” Dhoni said. “Their spinners did well to bowl away from the batsman. Our spinners made the error to bowl too full. If we would’ve maybe restricted them to 200, it would’ve been a good game.”  ",sports
Pollard plays 150th game for Mumbai,"  At the 2010 IPL player auction, Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders were locked in a fierce bidding war for West Indies all rounder Kieron Adrian Pollard. Eventually, Mumbai Indians grabbed him for a whopping $2.2 million. Since then, the Trinidadian has been a MI loyalist, and on Wednesday, he played his 150th IPL match for the four-time IPL champions. “Having someone like Pollard in the squad is always nice. He is a massive player for us, hopefully he’ll come out and enjoy his game, like he always goes,” MI captain Rohit Sharma said of the towering West Indian at the start of Wednesday’s match. A master of hitting humongous sixes, 33-year-old Pollard has played 11 consecutive seasons for MI since 2010, has scored 2,786 runs at an amazing strike rate of 146.64 — hitting 177 sixes and 183 boundaries. The only other player that instantly comes to mind for his loyalty to a single franchise is Virat Kohli, who has played for RCB in all 13 seasons that IPL has been in existence for. Pollard didn’t have an extraordinary first season with MI in 2010 — 273 runs in 14 matches without a half-century and 15 wickets — but the franchise owners kept faith in him as he was more than handy with the ball too. He has bagged 57 wickets at an economy rate of 8.83. A brilliant fielder in the deep, Pollard has taken 83 catches so far.               ",sports
Dugout,"  Dew factor will gain more sense The first week of the IPL has already shown that dew will play a major role in the tournament and it will only gain more significance as the pitches get slower, said Australian limited overs skipper and RCB opener Aaron Finch. The teams are expectedly preferring to chase after winning the toss with pitch getting easier in the second half and a wet ball making life tougher for the bowlers. ""The dew will play a big part in the tournament. The last three games, the game at Sharjah (CSK vs RR) and our game here (Dubai), there was more dew than expected,” said Finch. “I think as the games go on and there will be lots of games played over and over on the same wickets, the wickets will get slower and the dew factor will become even more.”   Morris recovering from side strain South Africa all-rounder Chris Morris is unlikely to be available for RCB's match against Kings XI Punjab on Thursday after suffering a side strain, the team's Director of Cricket Operations Mike Hesson said. “Chris Morris unfortunately picked up a slight side strain a few days ago, he would have played a huge role through the middle and death overs, his batting would have had a huge impact as well,” Hesson said in a video posted by on RCB's Twitter handle. “This does change the balance of our side, he is a three in one cricketer, he is not easy to replace and as a result, we had to change the structure of our side. “Hopefully, Chris will come into consideration for selection in a game or two, we will continue to monitor him,” he added.   Holder replaces Mitchell Marsh Australian and Sunrisers Hyderabad all-rounder Mitchell Marsh was on Wednesday ruled out of the remainder of the IPL with an ankle injury he suffered in the team's opener against RCB. West Indies captain Jason Holder has been named as Marsh's replacement and is expected to join the Sunrisers squad soon in the UAE. “Mitchell Marsh has been ruled out due to injury. We wish him a speedy recovery. Jason Holder will replace him for #Dream11IPL 2020,” Sunrisers posted on its official Twitter handle.   rayudu could miss one more game A mild hamstring niggle is likely to keep CSK' in-form batsman Ambati Rayudu out for one more IPL match. Rayudu, who played a blazing 71-run knock in the tournament opener against Mumbai Indians, missed CSK's second match against Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday night due to the injury. “It is not a serious injury. He has a mild niggle in hamstring. His participation in next game will be known only on match day,” CSK's chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan told PTI.

Samson, who was adjudged Man-of-the-Match, said his plan is to go and hit all the deliveries in his arc. “My game plan is stand and deliver.

IPL: Rohit's blitzkrieg powers Mumbai Indians to 195/5,"  Skipper Rohit Sharma pummelled the Kolkata Knight Riders bowling into submission and powered Mumbai Indians to an imposing 195 for five in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here on Wednesday. After Shivam Mavi (2/32) removed opener Quinton De Kock (1) cheaply, Rohit (80 off 54 balls; 3 fours, 6 sixes) and Suryakumar Yadav (47 off 28; 6 fours, 1 six) conjured 90 runs for the second wicket to pull the team out of trouble. Rohit, who began with a maximum, displayed his languid grace and elegance as he took the Kolkata attack to the cleansers. Surya effortlessly smashed four boundaries off Sandeep Warrier (0/34), including a cover-drive and a flick, in the third over. Rohit got going after smashing pacer Pat Cummins (0/49) for two maximums – both his trademark pull-short. With the two looking good and hitting sixes and fours at will, Mumbai raced to 94/1 after 10 overs. Kolkata, however, cut short Surya's stay when he was run out. Rohit continued his brutal onslaught against chinaman Kuldeep Yadav (0-39), smashing him for two maximums. Saurabh Tiwary (21), Hardik Pandya (18) played perfect second fiddle to Rohit, who literally bulldozed the opposition bowlers. Kolkata tried to pull things back by removing Rohit, Hardik in quick succession even as Mumbai added 48 runs in the last five overs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium.    ",sports

KKR face MI in battle of equals,"  Grace and strength will be on one side while poise and killer instinct on the other when a revamped Kolkata Knight Riders take on Mumbai Indians, who have once again faltered in the beginning of the IPL, on Wednesday. Since 2013, MI have never won an opening game and the script didn’t change against Chennai Super Kings also. They will be keen to bounce back while KKR would look for a perfect begining as it will be a battle between big hitters on both sides on a sluggish Abu Dhabi track. It will be Shubman Gill’s third IPL, the one where he would like to own the stage with his languid grace and effortless hitting, which he is so capable of. He can hit sixes over extra cover with grace and caress the ball through covers too. These are exactly the traits that made Rohit Sharma, the great white ball exponent that he is. Seasoned Rohit versus young Shubman is one for the keeps and makes this battle enticing. But it’s not just grace which makes T20 so appealing. The brute masculinity of power that sends the ball soaring into the orbit is what makes it so special. Hardik Pandya, who is back with a chiselled body. There is no doubt that he can unleash his firepower against Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav as well as KKR’s highest paid multi million dollar recruit Pat Cummins. But Hardik will find his match in Andre Russell, easily the most destructive hitter in current T20 cricket. Russell had openly criticised the team management last year for sending him down the order. But this time, he has been promised a promotion to number three slot and this could spell doom for any opposition. KKR has Eoin Morgan, easily the best white ball captain in international cricket at the moment, who could advice Dinesh Karthik on how to tackle tense moments. Whether he would fit in among the four overseas players is the question as Knights have Narine, Tom Banton, Russell and Cummins, who walk into any T20 playing XI. For Mumbai, it is important that Nathan Coulter-Nile, with more all-round T20 utility compared to Trent Boult, gets fit to add more balance. They could think about using Ishan Kishan’s explosive firepower rather than bulky Saurabh Tiwary, who can’t rotate the strike with ease. Apart from pacers and spinners Krunal Pandya and Rahul Chahar, they need one more option in the bowling and that can be in form of Pandya and Kieron Pollard. Both Hardik and Pollard, who did not bowl against CSK can jointly share the responsibility of another bowler.  ",sports

"I was very nervous, says Padikkal","  Considered a future India star, Devdutt Padikkal made an impressive IPL debut with a scintillating fifty but the young Kerala batsman says he was nervous when his place in the playing XI was confirmed to him. Displaying a range of shots and confidence in striking the ball hard and clean, the 20-year-old scored a 42-ball 56 to help Royal Challengers Bangalore post 163 for 5 against Sunrisers Hyderabad. ""I was very nervous upon hearing the news of making my debut. But when I came to bat I settled down after playing a few balls,"" Padikkal told Chahal during an interaction after the match. Padikkal said he has learnt a lot from RCB and India skipper Virat Kohli. ""The last one month that we practiced, I learnt a lot from Virat bhaiya. I kept asking him questions whenever I was around him. Even today, when I was playing with Finch, he showed a lot of confidence in me,"" he said. Chasing 164, SRH were 121 for two before Yuzvendra Chahal triggered a collapse with his twin strike in successive balls as they were all out for 153 in 19.4 overs. Talking about the 16th over (his last over) which changed the complexion of the game, Chahal said he looked to bowl an attacking line with a defensive field. ""It was an important over. I was thinking it could go for runs and also can be in our team's favour. My mindset was to pick wickets even though we set a defensive field. But the chat with Virat bhaiya was about bowling attacking line because only wickets can turn the match,"" Chahal said. ""The first ball I kept it at the leg stump, because it difficult to hit. When Vijay Shankar came, AB and Virat said let's bowl a googly, something that I was practising in the nets. We knew if it lands properly it will be difficult for a new batsman to read.""

Chahal (3/18) removed in-form Englishman Jonny Bairstow (61) and Vijay Shankar in successive balls in the 16th over to tilt the game decisively in RCB's favour. He had earlier gotten rid of Manish Pandey (34) in the 12th over. ""It's amazing to be honest. Last year, we were on the other side of the result, 6-nil to start. It is nice to be 1-nil. We kept our composure tonight,"" Kohli said at the post-match presentation on Monday. ""Yuzi (Chahal) comes in and completely changed the game for us. Not many spinners got much out of the pitch, but tonight he showed that you can turn it if you have it in your wrists. He showed he can get purchase on any wicket. The way he came in and bowled attacking lines, he changed the game."" Talking about his side's batting, Kohli said, ""We started really well. Devdutt Padikkal was really good on debut, Finchy as well. AB batting in the last three overs helped us push it past 160."" Asked if he thought 163 was a good enough total to defend, he said, ""When you lose two in two, you have to consolidate. If not for two in two, you were looking at maybe 10-20 runs more. ""In the past if we had 43 off 5, you'd see the shoulders dropping but the guys kept believing, kept attacking. Someone like Washy (Washington Sundar) not bowling enough and a part-timer doing it are good signs. The fact that we didn't let negativity slip into the bowling group was a great sign."" Player of the match Chahal said, ""When I bowled my first over, I realized I need to bowl stump-to-stump line and backed myself. ""At one point they were batting well and I was trying to bowl loopy ones and wide of the reach which helped in building pressure."" Sunrisers captain David Warner said his side had the run chase in control initially but later knew they had to go after the bowlers in the end.

"KXIP co-owner Wadia calls for better umpiring standards, optimum use of technology in IPL","  Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia wants the BCCI to ensure better umpiring standards and optimum use of technology in the IPL, following an umpiring howler which cost his team a match against Delhi Capitals. Wadia expressed his views after KXIP appealed against on-field umpire Nitin Menon's controversial 'short run' call at a crunch time of the game held on Sunday night in Dubai. Before the match went into Super Over, the TV footage showed that square leg umpire Menon had erred in calling Chris Jordan for a 'short run' in the third ball of the 19th over, bowled by Kagiso Rabada. The TV replays showed that Jordan's bat was inside the crease when he completed the first run, starting from the non-striker's end. ""It is exceedingly unfortunate that today with tremendous use of technology, we still do not use technology to ensure the total fairness and transparency in cricket game like several other leagues across the world including EPL, NBA, etc,"" Wadia said in a statement to PTI. ""I would request BCCI to ensure better umpiring and to ensure henceforth that technology is used to the maximum so as to ensure fairness and transparency in a game which is used across the best leagues in the world."" The short run call was not reversed despite technological evidence that it was a wrong call. As per the IPL rules, the third umpire does not have a say in reversing the decisions except 'no balls' and 'stumping'. In the final over, Punjab needed 13 runs to win and Agarwal managed 12 runs in the first three balls. If that one 'short run' was credited to their total, Punjab would have won with three balls to spare but they lost two wickets in the final two balls after a dot fourth ball and it spilled to a Super Over, which they lost. ""VAR (Video Assistant Referee) has become something which is used across the world. The game of yesterday in question between Kings XI and Delhi had two umpiring mistakes which cost KXIP the game,"" Wadia said. ""The first came in the first few overs of the match where a leg bye went for four. It was given as leg bye by the umpire but it was actually a wide ball. That one run would have helped Kings XI win the game versus losing. ""The second disastrous decision came at the end of the game in the last couple of overs, when a run was deemed as not being a run even though TV replays showed that it had been a run. Unfortunately, these two decisions cost Kings XI the game."" Wadia hoped the BCCI will tweak the IPL rule book to ensure the incident is not repeated. ""I do hope that BCCI implements a system and process so that the other teams do not suffer the same plight as Kings XI did yesterday. ""If technology is not to be used for the fairness and transparency of the game and to ensure that it is equitable to all, then why use technology at all?"" he asked.

Dhoni prefers all round players CSK pacer Deepak Chahar has revealed skipper MS Dhoni prefers players who can contribute in all departments, especially in the shortest format of the game. “I think Dhoni prefers those who are good in all departments. He likes those who can contribute in batting, bowling and fielding. A bowler can have a bad day but he can change a match by grabbing a good catch or can win the batch with a six or a four,” Chahar told Aakash Chopra in his show Aakash Vaani. “If you look at our team, we have many players who are good in every department. T20 is a format that requires you to do everything. There are a lot of teams in the IPL which have a strong batting line-up or a strong bowling attack but they remain dependent on a few cricketers,” he said. bumrah enjoys freedom under ro India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah said the freedom he enjoys playing under Rohit Sharma's captaincy in Mumbai Indians set-up has been a huge confidence booster for him in his career. “For me, he (Rohit) has always given me the freedom, he has always told me to express yourself (myself), be whatever you want, be it any situation, take ownership of your own bowling, so that gives me a lot of confidence and a responsibility that I'm responsible for whatever I'm doing,” Bumrah said. “So that's a big thing for a captain because then he gives a bowler so much of confidence. He trusts you so much and he trusts the decisions that you will take and that's a very positive sign.” Ashwin pain has settled down Senior India off-spinner R Ashwin is hopeful of recovering from his shoulder injury as his pain has subsided considerably and the scan reports have been “encouraging” after a nasty fall during Delhi Capitals' IPL opener against KXIP. Ashwin endured dream and nightmare in a space of six deliveries as he scalped two KXIP batsmen and then suffered a jerk on his left shoulder trying to dive and stop a run. “I was in pain as I left the field last night, but the pain has settled down and the scan reports are pretty encouraging too. Thanks for all your love and support,” Ashwin tweeted. Fleming hails Sam's attitude CSK head coach Stephen Fleming is impressed with debutant Sam Curran's attitude and said his contribution in the IPL opener went a long way in covering the absence of star all-rounder Dwayne Bravo, who is recovering from an injury. Sam played an instrumental role in CSK's five-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians. After an economical spell with the ball, the 22-year-old scored a quick-fire 18 off just six balls to help his side start the campaign on a positive note. “Losing Dwayne (Bravo) was a big loss and Sam went a long way in filling that,” Fleming told the CSK website. “The things that impressed us with Sam is his attitude first and foremost, almost the harder it gets the better he gets, his all-round skill component and the fact that the captain was able to trust him straightaway to go in at a crucial time and hit the way he did.” Hopefully will pull up well: Smith Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer said it was difficult to comprehend the ebbs and flows of a roller coaster IPL match against KXIP which ended in a Super Over win for his side. “It was difficult to see the game turning in different directions. We are used to this. Even last season we faced these. KG is the winning performer, and the way Stoinis batted was game-changing,” Iyer said.  ",sports
Mitch Marsh injured while bowling,"  Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh suffered an ankle injury while bowling during his side Sunrisers Hyderabad’s IPL opener against Royal Challengers on Monday. The 28-year-old Marsh twisted his ankle on the follow through during the fifth over of the RCB innings and he was seen hobbling out of the ground. Vijay Shankar completed the remaining two balls of the over and gave away nine runs. Marsh, who bowled only four deliveries, has had a history of injuries in the past. He didn’t come back to field during the rest of the RCB innings but came to bat as No 10 batsman during runchase and got out of the first ball.  ",sports

Real Madrid's attack scrutinized day after Bale's departure,"  Everyone seemed pleased when Real Madrid sealed the deal to loan Gareth Bale to Tottenham this weekend. It was a transfer that all parts wanted to make happen Bale wasn't happy in Madrid and the club didn't plan on using him. But a day after the Wales forward officially returned to the Premier League, Madrid struggled in attack in its Spanish league opener, sparking questions about the club's moves in the offseason. The defending champions were held to a 0-0 draw by Real Sociedad on Sunday, when the focus was on the team's attacking struggles. ""In general, we did well. The only thing missing was the goal and a bit of a killer instinct up top, particularly when the chances came our way,"" Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. ""Ultimately we struggled to create chances, particularly in the second half. In the first half, we had three opportunities but lacked that killer instinct."" Madrid wasn't expected to bring in anybody else to add that killer instinct or help make up for the absence of Bale, who had been one of the team's top names even though he wasn't much of a factor in Zidane's squad recently. Madrid was sticking to the forwards who had led the team to its first league title in three years last season, with French striker Karim Benzema supported by Brazilian youngsters Vin cius J nior and Rodrygo. The trio started against Sociedad but couldn't make much of an impact. Eden Hazard was supposed to play a big role as well but couldn't help much last season because of injuries, and he also wasn't fully fit for the opener on Sunday. Although the attack had thrived in the final stretch of last season, the team's poor run before that was largely blamed on the lack of scoring by the forwards, and the disappointing outing on Sunday raised concerns that the offensive struggles could be back. Also a reason for concern was Zidane's apparent lack of confidence in his other strikers. He had Luka Jovic and Borja Mayoral on the bench on Sunday but instead opted to bring in youth-squad forwards Sergio Arribas and Marvin, who also couldn't do much. ""We didn't want to change the system,"" Zidane said. ""You can bring your striker off and bring in two other strikers, but that changes the system, and I didn't want to do that."" Another player who may eventually help Zidane offensively is Marco Asensio, but like Hazard, he also had to deal with injuries recently and there will always be doubts about his condition. Zidane said he will have to ""look for solutions"" up front as the season advances. ""We know we have to improve in that area,"" he said. ""Defensively we did well and that's important. Now we are going to try to do things better in attack."" Madrid's second league match will be on Saturday at Real Betis, which won its first two games under coach Manuel Pellegrini. Madrid's game at Getafe on the opening weekend was postponed because it played later into last season in the Champions League. Madrid is trying to win back-to-back Spanish league titles for the first time since 2007-08.   ",sports
It really hurts to not close off game against Capitals: Agarwal,"  Crestfallen after losing their IPL opener, Kings XI Punjab batsman Mayank Agarwal said it feels terrible to not close off the game after making a stupendous comeback against Delhi Capitals here. Chasing 158 to win, KXIP were looking down the barrel at 55 for 5 but Agarwal's blistering 89-run knock took them to 157. They needed one run off the final two balls but Marcus Stoinis' twin strike took the game to the Super Over, which they lost on Sunday night. ""We had a tough day. There are a lot of positives to take out. The way we came back was fantastic, the way we bowled with the new ball was terrific. It really hurts to not close off the game from the situation we were in, feels terrible,"" Mayank told KXIP TV. ""This is just the first game. We can get things rolling again, let's see how we will go in the coming games. I think to play a game like that first up was fantastic. Everyone was up for it, guys really put in the effort. ""Definitely, we should have finished the game when we needed one run,"" he added. The 29-year-old from Bengaluru said 158 was a decent score to chase. ""It was a par score and going into the break, we knew that if we can stitch a partnership and not give them wickets with the new ball, we could win the game,"" he said at the post-match press conference. ""We batted extremely well to reach there. I don't know what to say (about the final moments)."" Mayank heaped praise on Stoinis, who smashed 53 off 21 balls as Delhi scored 57 in the last three overs to reach 157 for 8. ""Stoinis batted extremely well and even if we made a little mistake, he took us apart. So credit to him and he had a great game and he did really did well for them at the death,"" he said. Delhi's left-arm spinner Axar Patel said Stoinis form will ""have a good impact on the team"". ""If the team wants to go with six bowlers then you need an all-rounder and if he can contribute with both bat and ball it's really good for the team,"" Axar said. ""Stoinis performing like this in the first game itself means we don't have to change our strategy too much. It's good we won the Super Over and the morale is high in the dressing room."" Delhi didn't have a good start as they were reduced to 13 for 3 in 4 overs but skipper Shreyas Iyer (39 off 32) and Rishabh Pant (31 off 29) resurrected the innings before Stoinis finished with a flourish. ""We didn't expect we will lose three wickets in Powerplay. It happens sometimes you can't read the pitch quickly but the way Shreyas (Iyer) and Rishabh (Pant) contributed with their partnership, it gave us the momentum and in the end Stoinis completely handed us the momentum,""Axar said.

Stoinis shines in Super over win,"  Mayank’s fighting 89 goes in vain as DC sneak through  Kagiso Rabada once again proved to be the ‘King of Super Over’after Marcus Stoinis’ star turn with both bat and ball ensured a thrilling Super Over win for Delhi Capitals in an IPL encounter against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday. It was Stoinis whose late assault saw Delhi reach 157 for 8 in 20 overs with his 53 off 21 balls and 57 in the last three doing the trick. In reply, KXIP were looking down the barrel with half of the side back in the pavilion before Mayank Agarwal’s 89 off 60 balls took them to 157 before Stoinis came back to strike a double blow in the final two balls to set up a Super Over finish. Both the teams ended with score of 157 for eight and when it spilled to a Super Over, South African pacer Rabada conceded only two runs and took two wicket off successive balls to tilt in the favour of Delhi Capitals. Rabada had pulled off a stunning Super Over even the last year against Kolkata Knight Riders and like Andre Russell, this time it was Nicholas Pooran, who got a lethal yorker. It was difficult for Shami to defend two runs. Earlier, Shami’s exceptional fast bowling spell had put the Capitals on the mat as they had not crossed 100-run mark even after 16 overs but Stoinis’ whirlwind knock lifted the Delhi side to 157 for eight. The Capitals, sent in to bat, scored 57 runs in the last 18 balls with Stoinis punishing the bowlers with seven fours and three sixes. Punjab badly missed a good death bowler. Stoinis’ timely and gritty batting ensured that the repair work done by skipper Shreyas Iyer (39) and Rishabh Pant (31) did not go waste. The severe bashing demoralised Punjab batting line up, which fell apart in no time. However Mayank Agarwal emerged an unlikely batting hero, bringing Punjab back from no where. He, though, was dismissed when only one run was needed off the last ball of the innings but Chris Jordan could not score the final run, giving Stoinis his wicket and the match was tied. In Punjba’s chase skipper KL Rahul (21) was first to go and then India spinner R Ashwin sent back Karun Nair (1) and Nicholas Pooran (0) in space of five balls. It, though, did not end well for Ashwin, whose needless dive in the last ball to stop a single resulted in a freak shoulder injury. Ashwin landed on his left arm. Writhing in pain, Ashwin’s jersey became a temporary sling as he left the field. True to his reputation, Agarwal held the one end but Punjab needed Glenn Maxwell to fire, which did not happen as he could add only one run to his and team’s total. Half the batsmen back in the pavilion and no big-hitting batsman left in the line up, Agarwal’s heroic batting kept the game alive. He hit seven fours and four sixes. Earlier, the pitch had a tinge of grass, the ball was swinging and pacer Shami relished the bowling on a helpful track. His wicket-taking and run-choking act served the Punjab side well. It was a pitch that required patience from the batsmen but reckless shots was how Delhi Capitals began after being invited to bat, with Prithvi Shaw (5) paying the price for his extravagance and Shimron Hetmyer (7) failing to check his shot. Shikhar Dhawan (0) was run out to a horrible mix-up and the scoreboard was not a pleasant sight for the Delhi side at 13 for 3. However skipper Shreyas Iyer (39) and Rishabh Pant (31) respected the conditions to raise 73-run stand for the fourth wicket while Stoinis’ knock towards the end put Capitals in a psychologically advantageous position.

Kohli begins hunt for elusive IPL title as RCB face Sunrisers,"  Virat Kohli will begin his quest for an elusive IPL title when perennial under-achievers Royal Challengers Bangalore take on David Warner's low profile but consistent Sunrisers Hyderabad in their opening IPL encounter here on Monday. Both teams possess dangerous batsmen who can single-handedly take the game away from the opposition. Kohli has always led from the front but he knows his search for a maiden title will remain incomplete if the team doesn't perform in all departments. The addition of Australian limited overs captain Aaron Finch to the squad gives the star-studded batting line up more firepower. Expectations are also high from highly rated young opener Devdutt Padikal. On the other hand, Warner, whose exploits in the IPL include winning the 'Orange Cap' thrice and leading his side to a maiden title triumph in 2016, will once again pair up with the dangerous Jonny Bairstow. The formidable opening duo, that shattered multiple records including the highest opening partnership in IPL history against RCB last season, will hope to emulate the previous edition's exploits. Sunrisers also have the batting prowess of Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Mitchell Marsh and Fabian Allen. Following a nightmarish 2019 season when they finished last, RCB seem to have much better balance but there ability to hit late in the innings is yet to be tested. Sunrisers' blind spot also lies in the lack of depth in their batting order. The franchise has invested in youngsters like Virat Singh, Abhishek Sharma, Priyam Garg, and Abdul Samad and the management in the hopes that one of them could become the vital cog in the middle order. A team that is known for its depth and variation in bowling, Sunrisers' core unit remains unchanged. Bhuvneshwar Kumar will spearhead the pace department with Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul and Basil Thampi playing secondary roles. Armed with presence of the top T20 bowler Afghanistan leggie Rashid Khan and no.1 all-rounder in the format Mohammad Nabi, who was in a terrific form in the recently-concluded CPL, Sunrisers have one of the best spin bowling attacks in the tournament. They also have left-armer Shahbaz Nadeem. RCB also boasts of a potent spin unit, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will again be the key as he has been over the past seasons with Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Adam Zampa and Moeen Ali lending more options. RCB have also addressed the issue of their weak death bowling that plagued their campaign last season. The franchise has bought South African bowling all-rounder Chris Morris. At the helm of both sides are Australians, Sunrisers have appointed Trevos Baylis, who guided England to their maiden ODI World Cup title last year, as coach, RCB has placed its faith in Simon Katich to lead them. The Squads (From): Sunrisers Hyderabad: David Warner (c), Jonny Bairstow, Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Shreevats Goswami, Virat Singh, Priyam Garg, Wriddhiman Saha, Abdul Samad, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mitchell Marsh, Abhishek Sharma, Bavanaka Sandeep, Sanjay Yadav, Fabian Allen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, KhaleelAhmed, Sandeep Sharma, Shahbaz Nadeem, Siddharth Kaul, Billy Stanlake, TNatarajan, Basil Thampi.

Experience Of 300 ODIs pays off in these situations: Dhoni,"  Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said his team's tremendous ""experience"" proved to be a crucial factor in its five-wicket victory over defending champions Mumbai Indians in the IPL opener. Ambati Rayudu and Faf Du Plessis set up the win with a 115-run stand for the third wicket, while Piyush Chawla was exceptional with the ball and was aided by likes of Sam Curran, Deepak Chahar and Lungi Ngidi. ""The experience pays off, everyone talks about it. You get it only after you play a lot of games. 300 ODIs is a dream for anybody to play and when you put an XI on the field, you need a good mix of youngsters and experienced players,"" Dhoni said. ""You need the experienced players to guide the youngsters on and off the field. The young players get 60-70 days with the seniors in the IPL,"" the veteran added at the post- match presentation ceremony. Dhoni also spoke about what all things the team learnt from the first game. ""We may practice enough but when you go on the field you need to assess the conditions and give it your best. It took time for the bowlers to find the right length on this pitch. Plenty of positives but still plenty of areas for us to improve ""In the second half there is a bit of movement till the dew sets in. If you don't lose wickets early, you have the upper hand. These are the learnings. Rayudu had a wonderful partnership with Faf. Most of us are retired so luckily no injuries as well."" MI skipper Rohit Sharma was upset that none of his batsmen could carry on the initial momentum that they gained. ""None of our batsmen carried on for us, like du Plessis and Rayudu did for CSK. I think we were 85 in the first 10 overs. Credit to the CSK bowlers, they bowled well at the end to pull back things. Something for us to learn,"" Rohit said. ""Still early days. We all want to start really well, it's crucial in this tournament where momentum is important. Few things for us to learn from this game, we did make few mistakes. Hopefully we'll rectify those and come out smarter in the next game."" Rohit said his team needs to adapt to the conditions better. ""We need to adapt to the pitches, it got better with the dew coming. You need to hit the gaps and focus on that part of the game. The opposition can tie you down, it's all about understanding what we need to do,"" he said.

Super Victory,"  CSK ride on Rayudu and new recruits to trump MI Mahendra Singh Dhoni hasn’t lost an ounce of his leadership acumen even after a 437-day hiatus as his battle-hardened Chennai Super Kings outfit beat Mumbai Indians in the 13th Indian Premier League opener on Saturday. Ambati Rayudu (71 off 48 balls) blazed his way and Faf du Plessis (55 not out off 44 balls) more than made up for Suresh Raina’s absence at No 3, helping CSK chase down a tricky 163-run target in 19.2 overs overs and with five wickets to spare. It wasn’t a jam-packed Wankhede rooting for the Mumbai Indians nor was it the passionate Chepauk stands with its Yellow Army in full fervour. It was a near empty Sheikh Zayed Stadium in the Arabian desert where Bryan Adams’ Summer of 69 or Rocky’s theme music Eye of a Tiger blared from the sound systems along with artificial crowd cheers. In this eerie set-up, Captain Cool’s brain kept ticking as his new recruits — leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (1/21 in 4 overs) and left-arm seamer Sam Curran (1/28 in 4 overs) — made fantastic first impressions while the new ball pair of Lungi Ngidi (3/38 in 4 overs) and Deepak Chahar (2/32 in 4 overs) came back brilliantly at the death overs. The skipper also sent match-fit Sam Curran at No 6 and his 18 off 6 balls ended any anti-climax that Rohit Sharma’s men would have anticipated. Giving less than 80 runs in the back-10 was the turning point and then the manner in which Rayudu and Du Plessis chased it after a scratchy start as MI maintained their record of not winning an IPL opening game since 2013. Trent Boult, with an in-dipper and James Pattinson, with a slightly dodgy decision going his way, removed Shane Watson and Murali Vijay respectively, making it 6 for 2 before Rayudu, in the company of du Plessis, launched a furious counter attack. One of the major aspects was how clueless Jasprit Bumrah (1/43 in 4 overs) looked during the day and it cost his team dearly.    ",sports
Shubman will bat at top order: McCullum,"  Kolkata Knight Riders head coach Brendon McCullum on Saturday made it clear that Shubman Gill will open for them throughout the IPL to give the team some solidity at the top in tricky UAE conditions. The rising top-order batsman was tried out at different positions last season without the desired result and it was considered to be one of the reasons why KKR missed out on a play-off berth. “They’re (wickets) gonna be quite fresh, I think they could be quite helpful for seam bowling. If the wickets are going to be a little bit tricky early on against fast bowling, I think you want your players who have the best techniques and the best batsmanship and craft,” said McCullum. “... He’s (Shubman) certainly one of those guys... I see him batting at the top of the order throughout the campaign,” added the newly-appointed KKR coach in a media interaction. Impressed with the way, the 21-year-old Shubman carries himself, the Kiwi great said he wants to give the Indian youngster his own space and groom the other junior members in the team. “I think he’s got a bit of a presence about him, even at this young age, very respectful as well. I know DK (captain Dinesh Karthik) really respects him as a person as a cricket brain as well. And I think he’s going to be another wonderful resource for DK both on and off the field,” McCullum said. “I want to see the most out of him is just to grow on his own time, his own space but also take those around him, who are still reasonably inexperienced and grow at the same rate that he’s growing in his own career. “If we can do that, then the experience we can get into these guys at a young age, and pressure moments is going to be a very, very good thing for KKR this season. He’s got a very big role.” KKR started off well winning four of their first five matches, but they lost six matches on the trot in the business end to miss the qualifiers by a whisker. The team looked really dependent on Andre Russell, but this time reigning World Cup winning captain Eoin Morgan will lend solidity in the middle-order. Hailing the Englishman as the best middle-over batsman in limited overs cricket, McCullum said: “He’s probably the best middle-order batsman in the shorter version, over the last couple of years. So we’re very lucky to have him. His relationship with DK throughout this campaign will give us a good opportunity.” The England limited-overs skipper, who had a stint with KKR from 2011-2013, was bought at the auction for Rs 5.25 crore. The 34-year-old Morgan will be joining the side after leading England to their maiden World Cup glory in 2019. “He was a guy who we were desperate to get batting (at the auction) in the middle order around Russell and Karthik... He provides us with a really, really strong middle-order.” KKR chief mentor David Hussey had earlier said Russell is best suited at No 3 but McCullum was of the opinion that the star Jamaican is an ideal finisher in the T20 format and the team will have a ‘horses-for-courses’ approach. “I think his game is definitely suited to probably the last 10 overs of a T20 game. But there may be times where the matchups are right we can get in Andre a little bit earlier, up the order. “That will be a horses for courses type approach but the good thing is we’ve got lots of resources to be able to choose from.” Clearly indicating that Russell, Morgan, Sunil Narine and Pat Cummins will be the four overseas players that he will mainly depend on during the tournament, McCullum said the team can really shock the oppositions if the wickets aid seamers in the initial few matches. “Cummins has the ability to take early wickets and if we can do that, we know we’ve got some quality spinners. When you couple them all together, I’m really content with the unit that we’ve got, particularly on these wickets because they might have a little bit more in them than what most people are anticipating,” he said. “If the wickets play as we expect, then I think we could shock a few really with the pace and speeds with which our bowlers can operate,” he said. With the overseas combination already set for KKR, Tom Banton may have to wait for his chances. “He probably won’t start for us in this campaign because we will go with a slightly different balance but what he gives you so many different options. He has already made a bit of a splash in International cricket,” he said. “He’s a guy who even against various bowling attacks of the world, can still shock them, and dominate them. And when he gets his opportunity, I’m sure he will entertain the fans all around the world.”    ",sports

Liverpool seal swoop for Wolves forward Jota,"  Liverpool sealed the signing of Portugal forward Diogo Jota from Wolves for a reported £41 million ($54 million) on Saturday. Jota has signed a “long-term” contract with the Premier League champions, which is believed to be a five-year agreement. The 23-year-old joins Liverpool just 24 hours after they signed Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara for an initial £20 million. Jota will provide attacking depth for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, competing with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane for playing time in the wide positions in the team’s three-man forward line. “It’s just a really exciting moment for me and my family,” Jota told Liverpool’s website. “All of my path since I was a kid and now, to join a club like Liverpool — the world champions — is just unbelievable. I just want to get started.” Jota claimed the move to Anfield was too good an opportunity to turn down. “When you look at the Premier League, you always see Liverpool as one of the biggest teams in the country, so it’s impossible to say no,” he said. “So we just want to come (to the club), to give our best and hopefully I can become a good option for Liverpool in the future.” Earlier on Saturday, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo had confirmed Jota would be moving to Merseyside. “Diogo is amazing and everybody knows the relationship we built. What Diogo did for us is absolutely fantastic,” he said. “I think Diogo is going to the right place and we wish him all the best, knowing that it will never be forgotten, especially by our fans, all the memorable moments that Diogo provided.” Former Atletico Madrid forward Jota joined Wolves on loan in their 2017-18 Championship-winning campaign before making a permanent switch in 2018. While Jota’s departure is a blow for Wolves, they can look forward to the arrival of 18-year-old Dutch defender Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool as part of the Jota deal.  ",sports
Bayern love to score 8,"  Leroy Sane said all-conquering Bayern Munich crave even more silverware after the Germany winger scored on his debut in Friday’s historic 8-0 thrashing of Schalke in the opening game of the new Bundesliga season. “We’re still hungry, even though we won the treble last season,” said Sane after creating two goals for Serge Gnabry, who claimed a hat-trick in the goalfest at the Allianz Arena. “Winning our first game at home 8-0 is obviously super. It felt really, really good finally to be able to play with the lads,” said Sane, who spent most of last season sidelined at former club Manchester City after tearing knee ligaments at the very start of last season. “It’s been a very good day with lots of goals.” Just 26 days after winning the Champions League final, Bayern picked up where they left off last season with their 22nd-straight win. Gnabry opened the scoring with just four minutes gone with a great piece of finishing which gave Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann no chance. Burly central midfielder Goretzka grabbed the second against his former club when he hit the bottom corner from the edge of the box on 19 minutes. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga’s top scorer last season with 34 goals, opened his account for 2020/21 with half an hour gone. He netted a penalty after being brought down in the area by Schalke defender Ozan Kabak, who has been linked to a move to Liverpool. It was 3-0 at half-time, but Gnabry grabbed his second two minutes after the break when he fired into an empty net after a sprint by Sane pulled Faehrmann out of position. The pair combined again when Sane chested the ball down after getting in behind the defence and rolled the ball off to the waiting Gnabry to claim his hat-trick just before the hour mark. Mueller added the sixth on 69 minutes after Lewandowski had again cut Schalke’s defence to shreds. The records were sent tumbling as Sane marked his debut with the seventh on 71 minutes when he sprinted onto Joshua Kimmich’s superb pass and fired home with Lewandowski unmarked outside him. Musiala, who only turned 17 in February, became the club’s youngest scorer in the Bundesliga when he darted in from the left wing to add the eighth on 81 minutes.  ",sports

Andros Townsend hit a seventh-minute opener but the match was still in the balance with around 20 minutes to play when Palace were awarded a penalty, after Jordan Ayew’s flick struck the hand of Victor Lindelof. Goalkeeper David de Gea looked to have made himself a hero when he saved the softly struck penalty from Ayew, only for a re-take to be ordered, and this time former United winger Zaha stepped up to smash the ball high into the net. United new boy Donny van de Beek pulled one back, but Zaha added a third Palace goal in the 85th minute, holding off weak link Lindelof and drilling beyond De Gea from the edge of the penalty area. Hat-trick for DCL Dominic Calvert-Lewin hit a hat-trick and James Rodriguez bagged his first Premier League goal as Everton crushed 10-man West Bromwich Albion 5-2 to extend their perfect start to the season. Carlo Ancelotti’s side fell behind to Grady Diangana’s early goal at Goodison Park. But Calvert-Lewin equalised and James put them ahead before West Brom imploded. Kieran Gibbs was dismissed for pushing James in the face in first half stoppage-time. Then Albion boss Slaven Bilic was sent to the stands after storming onto the pitch for a furious rant at referee Mike Dean. Matheus Pereira equalised for Albion after the interval, but Michael Keane restored Everton’s lead and Calvert-Lewin sealed the points with his second and third goals. At 23, Calvert-Lewin is the youngest Englishman to score a Premier League hat-trick for Everton. After a summer spending spree, Ancelotti is under pressure to deliver a big improvement on last season’s 12th place finish and the early signs are promising. Having beaten Tottenham in their opening game last weekend, Everton have started a Premier League season with consecutive victories for the first time since 2012-13. Calvert-Lewin already has four goals and Colombia midfielder James, making his first home appearance since his £12 million from Real Madrid, looks a quality addition. If West Brom are to avoid an immediate return to the Championship, they will have to improve their defence rapidly after shipping eight goals in successive defeats. Diangana put West Brom ahead in the 10th minute when he advanced from inside his own half before drilling a long-range drive past Jordan Pickford. Calvert-Lewin equalised in the 31st minute with a back-heel from virtually on the goalline after Albion defender Darnell Furlong inadvertently headed Seamus Coleman’s cross into his path. The goal was initially disallowed for offside before a VAR review changed the decision in Everton’s favour. James put Everton in front in the 45th minute when he took Richarlison’s pass and lashed a fine low finish into the far corner from 20 yards. Gibbs added to West Brom’s woes when he was sent off for lashing out at James in retaliation for a challenge by the Colombian. Bilic lost his cool as well moments later, angrily telling Dean that his decisions could “kill” his team. Now watching from the stands after his dismissal, Bilic saw Pereira equalise with a superb free-kick in the 47th minute. But Keane poked Everton back in front after Richarlison’s header was pushed out by Sam Johnstone in the 54th minute. Calvert-Lewin struck again in the 62nd minute, the striker sliding in to meet Richarlison's cross with a close-range finish. And Calvert-Lewin’s red-hot start to the season continued four minutes later when he completed his hat-trick as the ball bounced off his back into the net. Leeds on right side This time, Leeds was on the right end of a 4-3 thriller in the Premier League. A week after losing at champion Liverpool by the same score line on the opening day of the season, Leeds was involved in another wild contest in its first home game back in the division and came out on top against fellow promoted team Fulham. Helder Costa scored in each half for Leeds, the second goal proving to be the winner at an empty Elland Road for Marcelo Bielsa’s attack-minded side. Fulham, which had two goals from striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, has now lost back-to-back games to open the season, having already been beaten 3-0 by Arsenal. Between them, Leeds and Fulham have conceded 14 goals in four games so far. West Bromwich Albion, the other side promoted from the second-tier Championship for this season, has conceded eight. Costa gave Leeds a fifth-minute lead by slamming a shot in off the bar from an acute angle after Fulham midfielder Harrison Reed inadvertently flicked on a corner by the hosts. Penalties have been a feature of the first two rounds of the league and there were two in six minutes here. In the 35th, Mitrovic converted a spot kick after Robin Koch tripped Joe Bryan, despite trying to pull out of his attempted tackle. Koch also gave away a penalty at Anfield last weekend. Mateusz Klich replied with one of his own for Leeds in the 41st after Bryan pushed Patrick Bamford in the back. Bamford then scored for the second straight match by stroking home a finish following a pass from Klich, before providing the cross that Costa swept in in the 57th for 4-1. Fulham fought back through goals by Bobby Reid in the 62nd — four minutes after coming on as a substitute — and Mitrovic in the 67th but Leeds held on.    ",sports

"Woods, Mickelson, defending champ Woodland miss US Open cut","  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are heading home, hot-footing it out of Winged Foot after missing the cut at the US Open. Defending champion Gary Woodland also will be watching this weekend when his replacement is crowned in the pandemic-delayed tournament outside of New York City. ""It's never easy to not be playing for the championship on a weekend,"" said Woods, who with the pandemic-shuffled schedule will have a chance to add to his total of 15 major victories at the Masters in November and again in April. ""The whole goal of entering an event is to win,"" he said after following an opening-round 73 with a 77 on Friday to miss the cut four strokes. ""When I don't give myself an opportunity to do that, it doesn't feel good."" A total of 62 player reached the weekend after finishing the first 36 holes at 6 over or better. John Pak (+5) wrapped up low amateur honors as the only one to make the cut. Shane Lowry followed a 76 in the first round with a 70 on Friday, finishing up in the morning and then heading home to hope his score would hold up. ""Look, I'll have a long afternoon sitting back, watching TV, praying for guys to make bogeys,"" he said with half the field yet to play. ""That's where I'm at now."" He got his wish and will stay around for the weekend. Not so lucky was Woods. He missed the cut for the eighth time in his last 15 majors after missing the cut at one just three times in a span from 1996-2014. ""It's frustrating that I'm not going to be here for the weekend and be able to compete for this great championship,"" he said. ""It feels like the way the golf course is changing, is turning, that anybody who makes the cut has the opportunity to win this championship. I didn't get myself that opportunity."" Mickelson is a six-time US Open runner-up hoping to complete the career Grand Slam at the course where he had his biggest disappointment. In 2006, he took a one-shot lead into the 18th hole before an errant drive led to a double bogey that gave Geoff Ogilvy the trophy. The five-time major champion shot 79 on Thursday -- just one stroke out of last place. A 74 in the second round wasn't much to build on. ""It's fun for me to return; it's fun for me to come back here,"" he said, adding that he missed interacting with the New York galleries on the empty course. ""I love the people here and I'm sorry they weren't able to come out to the tournament. But I think it's one of the best golf courses that we play, and play majors on. And it was fun for me to have to play and compete here one more time."" Woodland was 13 under last year to spoil Brooks Koepka's bid to match a 114-year-record with his third straight national championship. It was the lowest 72-hole total in six US Opens at Pebble Beach. ""This meant a lot to me, coming back here defending,"" he said. ""I put a lot of time and effort into it, and if your body doesn't let you do it, you just can't do it, and that's frustrating."" But his title defense never got going because of a torn labrum in his left hip. He shot 74 on both days, starting off Friday's round with a double bogey on No. 10 and then making bogey on three straight holes Nos. 15-17. ""I've got a lot of pain in there, and I've been fighting through it,"" he said. ""But it gets to a point where you're playing against the best players in the world, you just can't play with pain. I've played with pain my whole life, but it's getting a little tough."" Defending PGA Championship winner Collin Morikawa left a birdie putt 1 inches short on the final hole to finish at plus-7 and miss the cut by one stroke.   ",sports
Silverwood wants England players in IPL to guard against burn-out,"  England head coach Chris Silverwood has no doubt that competing in a world class event like IPL will help his players prepare well for the T20 World Cup but is worried about players burning themselves out. As many as 10 England players, including seven cricketers who were involved in the recent limited over series against Australia, reached UAE on Thursday from the United Kingdom ahead of the IPL which begins on Saturday. Silverwood said the players need to be cautious against burn-out as they have to stay in the bio-bubble for another seven weeks. ""It's their decision really but we'll have to keep an eye on them,"" he said after England's three-wicket defeat in the third ODI at Manchester. ""Obviously, the contracts are good for them but equally as well we're looking forward at a T20 World Cup. The more high-class T20 they can play will be a good thing for us."" ""The one thing that I have encouraged is that they keep talking to us. We need to make sure that they don't burn out as well."" The next T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held in India next year in October-November. England trio of Jos Buttler, Tom Curran and Jofra Archer will play for Rajasthan Royals, while England white-ball skipper Eoin Morgan will turn up for Kolkata Knight Riders, alongside Tom Banton. Moeen Ali (Royal Challengers Bangalore), Jonny Bairstow (Sunrisers Hyderabad) and Sam Curran (Chennai Super Kings) are among other England players who will feature in the IPL this year. Archer, who was sanctioned for breaching the bio-bubble during the Test series against the West Indies, has hinted that the white-ball leg was more enjoyable than the Test camps. Silverwood said: ""Jofra's found being locked up difficult at times. He's not the only player, there's been quite a few. We have to do it and I'm very proud of how the guys have dealt with it."" ""It's a juggling act of keeping people fresh in the mind. When people have asked to get out of the bubble, we've got them out. We said we would and we have. It's a case of making sure we don't burn people out.""   ",sports
CA working in tandem with Royals over Smith’s concussion,"  Cricket Australia on Thursday revealed that Steve Smith is following “concussion protocols” which are crucial for his return to cricket in the IPL and asserted that it is “not willing” to compromise with the fitness of the Rajasthan Royals skipper. CA said it is working in tandem with RR to ensure his smooth return to competitive action after missing the entire England ODI series due to the concussion suffered during training. “Cricket Australia has strict protocols when it comes to head impacts and concussions and, as we’ve seen over the last 12 months, we’re not willing to compromise on those,” CA’s head of sports science Alex Kountouris said in a statement. “Steve is making progress and working with our medical team through the concussion protocols required to return to play,” he added. Smith was hit on the head during a net session prior to the first ODI in Manchester and since then recovered well but not enough to play a competitive cricket. Kountouris said the franchise and CA will be working together to monitor Smith’s fitness upon his arrival in the UAE. Smith had also endured a concussion during last year’s Ashes game at the Lord’s and subsequently missed a Test match.  ",sports
Nitish hopes to learn from Morgan’s leadership qualities,"  Kolkata Knight Riders left-handed batsman Nitish Rana is excited to play alongside Eoin Morgan and hopes that he will imbibe some of reigning World Cup-winning skipper’s leadership qualities. The England limited-overs skipper was bought at the auction for Rs 5.25 crore as he’s set to reunite with the franchise after his stint from 2011-2013. The 34-year-old will be joining the side after leading England to their maiden World Cup glory in 2019 and Rana, who led Delhi at domestic level, is excited. “I hope I also have that sort of leadership quality so that it helps in my domestic team and I grow as a player,” Rana said in a media interaction. “He is one such rare left-handed batsman who dominates white ball cricket. He’s a World Cup-winning captain of a successful country. I’m looking forward to learning many things from him.” On the slow pitches in the UAE, a pace-heavy KKR line-up will have limited spin resources in Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav. Rana, who bowls part-time offspin, is also looking forward to get some more overs under his belt this time. “Bowling is not a new thing to me. I’ve been bowling in domestic cricket. It’s good that spinners will get an advantage here so that I also will get some grip. I’ve improved as a player and a bowler. Hope I get more overs and help the team.” The left-hander said he does not have a fixed batting slot and is ready to serve the team at any position. “I will bat as per team demand. I don’t have a fixed batting slot. I’m available to serve the team at any spot.” Having served long injury lay-offs respectively, the 2018 U-19 World Cup winning duo of Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi are back in full throttle, Rana said. “Nagarkoti was unfortunate to be injured for two years. He’s back strong. But this time, both of them are back in full rhythm and clocking 140kph-plus consistently. It will be challenging for any batsman. I hope they will do well,” he added.  ",sports
Messi nets 2 in friendly win,"  Lionel Messi scored his first goals of Barcelona’s preseason as coach Ronald Koeman left Luis Suárez and Arturo Vidal off his team for a second friendly match. Messi netted two goals and set up one more in a 3-1 victory over second-tier Girona, Barcelona’s second training match since Koeman took over as coach. The goals were also Messi’s first since his failed attempt to leave the club this offseason. Barcelona posted a photo on Twitter of Messi and Koeman clasping hands when the star forward was substituted along with most of his teammates with half an hour to go. It seemed meant to deliver a message of unity between the player and manager amid one of the most tumultuous periods in the club’s recent history. Girona offered little resistance to Barcelona’s attack, formed by new signing Francisco Trincão, Philippe Coutinho, Antoine Griezmann and Messi. Messi’s perfectly placed pass sent Trincão clear for the Portugal forward to square the ball to Coutinho, who only had to scoop in the 20th-minute opener. Messi doubled the lead in the 45th with a shot from outside the area that went in off the upright. Samuel Saiz got Girona on the scoreboard after halftime before Messi got his brace with a shot that took a deflection off a defender to fool the Girona goalkeeper.  ",sports
Draxler wins for PSG at the death,"  Julian Draxler’s header deep into stoppage time gave Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 home win against Metz and spared the defending champion a fourth straight match without scoring. After losing the Champions League final 1-0 to Bayern Munich last month, PSG opened its league campaign with a 1-0 defeat at Lens followed by a 1-0 loss at home to Marseille on Sunday in which three PSG players were sent off. PSG finished this game with nine men after center half Abdou Diallo was red carded for a second yellow midway through the second half and left back Juan Bernat limped off injured near the end. After missing a host of chances, another embarrassing setback looked likely for PSG until Metz goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja failed to properly clear Angel Di Maria’s cross from the left. The opportunist Draxler headed home in the 93rd minute to save coach Thomas Tuchel from more pressure. “We had chances to score in the first half, but we missed all of our good chances,” Tuchel said. Key midfielder Marco Verratti was sidelined with a minor injury, while striker Kylian Mbappé was also absent as he continues his recovery from the coronavirus. Mbappé could return for Sunday’s difficult match away to coach Patrick Vieira’s Nice. PSG was also missing Neymar, left back Layvin Kurzawa and midfielder Leandro Paredes against Metz. They were suspended after being sent off following a stoppage-time brawl against Marseille. Neymar claims he was racially abused during the game by Marseille defender Álvaro González. But the league’s disciplinary commission said on Wednesday night that so far there is not enough evidence to summon the players for a hearing. The disciplinary commission suspended Kurzawa for six games, while Neymar and Paredes each got a three-game ban plus one game suspended.    ",sports
"ICC Rankings: Virat maintains pole position in ODI chart, Bairstow enters top-10","  India captain Virat Kohli maintained the top rank in the ICC ODI rankings for batsmen while Englishman Jonny Bairstow broke into the top-10 following a string of good performances against Australia in the just concluded white ball series. Kohli (871 points) and his deputy Rohit Sharma (855 points, ranked two) are out of action for some time due to COVID-19 forced break but they have kept intact their positions. Bairstow topped the series aggregate with 196 runs after his 126-ball 112 in the final match to re-enter the top 10. The previous best for the 30-year-old Yorkshire player was ninth position in October 2018. He is now within 23 points of his career-best rating points of 777. Glenn Maxwell and Alex Carey after their hundreds in a series-winning cause also made gains in the ranking charts. Maxwell has gained five places to take joint 26th position along with Paul Stirling of Ireland after scoring 186 runs in the series, while Carey comes in next after his total of 152 runs elevated him 11 places to a career-best 28th position. England all-rounder Chris Woakes is a major gainer in the rankings for bowlers, advancing three places to a career-best fourth position after finishing with six wickets in the series. New Zealand's Trent Boult and India's Jasprit Bumrah are current occupying the top two slots. Woakes is also second in the list of all-rounders after also notching 89 runs in the series. His compatriot Ben Stokes is among those he has overtaken to reach within 20 points of Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi. Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has returned to the top 10 for the first time in nearly two years, his player of the match performance of 3/34 in the first match the highlight of a four-wicket tally. He has moved up from 15th to eighth position. Five-time World champions Australia collected 20 points from their first series of the Super League, introduced to add context to bilateral ODI series. The top seven teams from the Super League and hosts India book direct spots for the 2023 World Cup. England lead the points table but are the only team to have played two series, winning 2-1 at home against Ireland early on in the championship. India manage to hold onto their second position.

"Even with Leonard and George, Clippers stall in playoffs","  The more things changed for the Los Angeles Clippers, the more they stayed the same. They shocked the league by adding superstars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to a proven cast, immediately creating major expectations for the franchise to win its first NBA championship. In the end, the Clippers reverted to their old selves. They blew a 3-2 series lead and double-digit leads in multiple games against the Denver Nuggets, and got sent packing from the NBA playoff bubble. The franchise once mocked as the laughingstock of the NBA couldn't erase a big part of its ignominious history: 0-8 all time in games in which it could clinch a spot in the conference finals. We did have championship expectations. We had the talent to do it, Lou Williams said. ""I don't think we had the chemistry to do it and it showed."" George missed time to start the season while recovering from two offseason shoulder surgeries. Playing for his third team in three years, Leonard followed a load management program before the pandemic, rarely playing back-to-back games because of his left knee. The Clippers ran though numerous lineup changes and then the coronavirus pandemic hit, halting the season in March. Once the NBA resumed play in the bubble in Florida, the team lost players. Montrezl Harrell, the Sixth Man of the Year, missed 30 days; Patrick Beverley was out 16 days; Williams missed 14 days, including 10 in quarantine after visiting a strip club during an excused absence from the bubble. Some of that came back and haunted us, coach Doc Rivers said. But once you get to the playoffs, throw that all out the window and you've got to perform. You've got to perform better. You've got to execute better. You've got to trust better. You've got to play better as a team. It didn't happen, especially in Game 7. Leonard scored 14 points on 6 of 22 shooting; George scored 10 points on 4 of 16 shooting. The Clippers had just 33 points in the second half, and they didn't make a field goal in the fourth quarter until 4:58 was left in the game. George sees no need to tear up the roster. We like what we got, he said. The more we can be together, the better we'll be. It's year one."" Leonard owns two championship rings (San Antonio and Toronto) and Rivers has one (Boston). George joined Leonard in coming home to Los Angeles for a shot at his first in his 10th season in the league after years of futility in Indiana and Oklahoma City. Leonard and George are under contract for one more year; then each has an option for the 2021-22 season. After the game, fans took to the airwaves and social media to mourn or vent, with many calling for Rivers' job despite their personal affection for the veteran coach. He's guided teams to 3-1 leads in three series, and each time they've failed to advance. It happened to the Clippers against Houston in 2015, too. Rivers has taken the Clippers to the playoffs in six of his seven years with the team.   ",sports
Novak remains perfect,"  Djokovic extends unbeaten run on court, behaves better in 1st match since US Open default Novak Djokovic expressed his relief there was no “mental or emotional blockages or drama” as he swept past Italian wild card entry Salvatore Caruso into the Italian Open third round on Wednesday in his first match since his US Open default. “I was actually looking forward to get the official match as soon as possible after what happened in New York,” said the world No 1. Nine-time Rome winner Rafael Nadal also made his return to competition later on Wednesday after a six-month hiatus linked to the coronavirus pandemic. The number two seed beats fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, a recent semi-finalist at the US Open, 6-1, 6-1 for a place in the third round. The Serb was on his best behaviour after his dramatic last 16 disqualification on September 6 after he accidently struck a line judge with a ball hit in frustration. “I didn’t feel that I had any mental or emotional blockages or any dramas playing a match today,” he said. Djokovic, who had said he had learned a “big lesson” from his first ever disqualification, was keen to move on in Rome. The 33-year-old playfully greeted an imaginary crowd in an empty Central Court at the Foro Italico because of strict coronavirus measures. Only some noisy workers managed to unnerve the 17-time Grand Slam winner after missing break points. “It was very, very quiet, which is very unusual to what we are used to here in Rome, which has one of the loudest and most energetic crowd atmospheres on the tour. Djokovic continued where he left off before his US Open exit, having won the Cincinnati Masters on the same Flushing Meadows courts. “It was a very good test for me. I’m very pleased with the way I handled myself in important moments,” said Djokovic, who was unbeaten in 2020 before his US Open default. “I was in control of the match.” Djokovic, who has played nine finals in Rome, and won four titles, will meet 29th-ranked compatriot Filip Krajinovic who beat Italian qualifier Marco Cecchinato 6-4, 6-1, for a place in the quarter-finals. The number two seed plays fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, a recent semi-finalist at the US Open, for a place in the third round. Third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas fell to Italian teenager Jannik Sinner 6-1, 6-7 (9/11), 6-2, with sixth seeded Belgian David Goffin also exiting 6-2, 6-2 to Croatia’s Marin Cilic.   Halep, Azarenka advance Top women’s seed Simona Halep returned a month after winning in Prague to ease past 99th-ranked Italian Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 6-4. “It was a little bit difficult to get the rhythm and to get relaxed,” said the 28-year-old Romanian, who skipped the US Open but is warming up for a bid for a second French Open title. The world No 2, a two-time Rome finalist, next meets Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine who beat American Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 . US Open finalist Victoria Azarenka shrugged off the move from hard court to the clay surface to beat Venus Williams 7-6 (9/7), 6-2, in their first round match. Belarusian Azarenka will play third seeded American Sofia Kenin, the reigning Australian Open champion, for a place in the third round. Swiss sixth seed Belinda Bencic fell 6-3, 6-1 in her second round match to Montenegro’s 86th-ranked Danka Kovinic.  ",sports
"The shape, mental space I'm in now, things will go well: Hardik","  Back from an lengthy injury layoff, Mumbai Indians' star all-rounder Hardik Pandya said the setback motivated him to work harder and he is now in good shape both physically and mentally for the IPL starting September 19. Pandya's form will be crucial for defending champions Mumbai Indians, who will take on Chennai Super Kings in the lung-opener of the cash-rich T20 league on September 19. ""The way I'm hitting the ball right now, the shape I'm in, the mental space I'm in, it is just a matter of time that I go and spend some time on the ground and I think things will come out pretty well,"" Pandya said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians' official Twitter handle. ""No matter how far I go from the game, no matter how long I stay out, when I come back, it has to be worth it. I have prepared very well and I think, great things are coming ahead,"" the 26-year-old flamboyant all-rounder added. Last year in November, Pandya had undergone a back surgery in London. He came back in the DY Patil T20 tournament held in early March. He was even selected for the ODI series against South Africa, but the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the rubber to be abandoned, delayed his return. He is now looking forward to the IPL. ""IPL is something that I have enjoyed a lot and I would like to make a comeback very strong and I'm just looking forward to it,"" said Pandya. He also conceded that injuries would be a part of his cricketing journey and motivate him to do better. ""In my life I have realised one thing that injuries would be with me. No one wants to get injured, but I accept the fact that what I do, injuries would be a part of it. ""Injuries have always kept me going, always kept me motivated. Actually taught me how much I have to put in the hard yards and the hard work has always increased, never decreased,"" said the Baroda all-rounder. Pandya also threw light on how he maintained his fitness during the lockdown. ""Luckily, me and (my brother) Krunal (Pandya) had the privilege to have a gym in our house. So because of that portion, we were able to work on our fitness...,"" he said. ""And I always feel that if you go one step ahead in your fitness, there are much more magical moments in your life (that) are waiting,"" the right-hander emphasised. Looking back at the DY Patil T20 Cup, which was his comeback tournament, Pandya, who has 1,068 runs from 66 IPL games, said it gave him confidence to implement his plans. ""Luckily, I got one tournament before, which was DY Patil, which I played for Reliance. And as a player, it gave me immense confidence to implement the hard work which I have done over a period of time and it just felt good,"" he signed off.

Power of 3,"  New German recruits make Blues debut in 3-1 away win against Brighton A Chelsea team featuring just two of its slew of high-profile and expensive signings got off to a winning start in the English Premier League by beating Brighton 3-1. Timo Werner and Kai Havertz - signed for a combined $160 million - didn’t manage to score at Amex Stadium, either, with Chelsea’s goals coming from Jorginho, Reece James and Kurt Zouma. James’ was the most spectacular and the most crucial, the right back’s swerving piledriver from 30 meters regaining the lead for Chelsea at 2-1 in the 56th minute, just two minutes after Brighton equalized through Leandro Trossard. Zouma’s deflected volley from a corner in the 66th then gave Chelsea some breathing space. “I thought we were OK,” Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said. “I liked the work ethic and discipline of the team. “We have been together for four days. ... To expect everything to click on day one would have been difficult.” While Havertz was fairly ineffective in his position on the right of midfield, fellow Germany international Werner - the lone striker - was more impressive and earned the penalty that was converted by Jorginho to break the deadlock in the 21st minute. Brighton midfielder Steven Alzate lost possession in central midfield as the hosts tried to play the ball out from the back, Werner was played through and was brought down by goalkeeper Mat Ryan. Jorginho sent Ryan the wrong way. Much-criticized goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was handed a start by Chelsea manager Frank Lampard but his failure to keep out Trossard's 54th-minute shot from outside the area will likely keep the scrutiny on him. Kepa seemed slow to get down as the ball squirmed beyond his outstretched right hand. James quickly put Chelsea back in front with a stunning strike that flew into the roof of the net, and the right back sent in the corner that Zouma met with a volley that ricocheted in off Brighton defender Adam Webster’s right foot. Of Chelsea’s other offseason signings that combined to cost $250 million, left back Ben Chilwell and playmaker Hakim Ziyech were injured and center back Thiago Silva wasn't ready after only recently joining up with the squad. “The players are still working each other out a little bit,” Lampard said. “Today we weren't as fluid as we could be ..

Fuming Paire shows little effort in 1st-round loss,"  Benoit Paire’s anger at being strictly confined at the U.S. Open after contracting the coronavirus boiled over at the Italian Open during a farcical first-round match. The 24th-ranked Paire threw his racket high into the air twice during one game and showed little effort against Italian teenager Jannik Sinner in a 6-2, 6-1 loss. Paire was forced to stay in isolation in New York until he tested negative — preventing him from training. The Frenchman criticized Rome organizers for making him play on the opening day of the tournament. “I made only one request, which is to play Tuesday to have an extra day of training after what happened to me in New York, and because I’m playing an Italian you put me on Monday,” Paire tweeted on Sunday. Twice during the second set, Paire launched his racket high into the air in frustration — the second time coming dangerously close to hitting the chair umpire. Paire, who put on a face mask during some of the changeovers, had numerous verbal exchanges with the chair umpire but received only one warning for his behavior. During the final game of the match, Paire slammed returns of serve into the net in anger — with seemingly no intent of putting the ball into play. When he finally managed to get a return into play on Sinner’s first match point, Paire seemed surprised and didn’t bother running down Sinner’s reply. “I had not played in 10 days, staying in my room,” Paire said. “It was a good training, I’m happy I played one hour. I even played one hour and four minutes. I’m happy I hung on for 1:04. I gave what I could. Jannik played very well. “The result does not really matter,” Paire added. “I still have the doubles. I will try to entertain myself with Nico (Nicolas Mahut) and try to win a match.” The tournament at the Foro Italico, where spectators are barred, was rescheduled from its usual May slot due to the pandemic. Sinner said, “On one hand I can understand, after spending so many days under quarantine in New York. … In the end, I did what I needed to.” He moves on to meet third-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. Kei Nishikori — who is returning from right elbow surgery and missed the U.S. Open after testing positive for COVID-19 — won for the first time in more than a year, beating Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-4, 7-6 (3). Also in the first round, Casper Ruud of Norway rallied past Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 6-1; Borna Coric beat Cristian Garin 6-4, 6-4; Grigor Dimitrov eliminated wild card Gianluca Mager 7-5, 6-1; and Filip Krajinovic beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-5.

DC has firepower to go all the way: Axar,"  Delhi Capitals all-rounder Axar Patel on Tuesday said he has “ticked all the boxes” in every department and reckoned the franchise has the firepower this time to win the IPL title, which has so far eluded them. Moved out of India due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the 13th edition of the world’s biggest T20 league will be held in the three venues of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the UAE from September 19 to November 10. Delhi Capitals will enter the tournament as one of the top contenders. Commenting on the team that comprises some fine players, Axar said, “With the new changes, I think the squad looks good. With fast bowlers, spinners and all-rounders, we have covered all the bases and I think we can become champions this time. “Everyone looks positive in the nets and we all are in good shape.” The 26-year-old left-arm spinner, who is slowly adapting to the new normal amid the pandemic, spoke about the challenges that lay ahead and the experience of training while staying in a bio-bubble. “Obviously, with no crowd, we’ll feel empty. Then, the saliva ban is going to make a big difference for the bowlers. “During initial practice sessions, I was being conscious of not using saliva or sweat on the ball. So, these are the challenges which we will have to be wary of. “Nevertheless, the positive thing is that at least we will have action-packed cricket after a long time, which is a good thing for not only us, but also for India. Everyone will enjoy the game with a different frame of mind which will be really exciting,” he said. As part of the guidelines framed by the BCCI, the players and support staff will be tested every five days throughout the league. ""We are feeling a little bad that we can’t enjoy the matches with our friends. After every two days, tests are being conducted. “We can’t go out anywhere and we can’t sit for more than 15 minutes in anyone's room, so these things are challenging, but slowly we are getting used to it.”  ",sports
Murray gets French Open wildcard,"  Andy Murray received a wild card into the French Open. The former No. 1 was the only non-Frenchman of eight players to be given a free pass into the main draw of the clay grand slam which starts in 13 days. Murray was also awarded a wild card into the U.S. Open, after his struggles with pelvic and shin injuries dropped his ranking to 129th. He went two rounds in New York, and improved to 110th, but still too low for the French Open when it published its main draw entry list. Murray’s best French Open result was the final in 2016. Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria and Eugenie Bouchard of Canada were the only non-Frenchwomen to receive wild cards. Pironkova, who made the U.S. Open her first comeback tournament since 2017 after having a son, achieved an impressive first-time run to the quarterfinals, where she was stopped by Serena Williams. Pironkova’s best result at Roland Garros was the quarterfinals in 2016. Bouchard reached her first final in more than four years in Istanbul on Sunday and lost in a third-set tiebreaker. She lost to eventual champion Maria Sharapova in the French Open semifinals in 2014, the same year she reached the Wimbledon final.    ",sports
COVID-19 episode made me mentally stronger: Manpreet,"  India hockey skipper Manpreet Singh says going through a stressful isolation period while recovery from coronavirus has made him a mentally strong player who is now equipped to tackle any situation on the field. Manpreet was one of the six hockey players to test positive for COVID-19 at the team’s training base in Bengaluru last month after they arrived for the national camp. Having started their individual sessions after recovering, Manpreet said they still miss being part of the rest of the squad, even though Hockey India, Sports Authority of India and support staffs are doing their best to keep them upbeat. “Hockey India officials would check on us almost every day if the food being provided is good, if our tele-treatment was done regularly, if we are monitoring our oxygen levels regularly and so on. “Coaching Staff and teammates too would check on us through video calls. These things really helped us remain upbeat. Though it did sting a little to know all our teammates were back on the pitch while we were still in isolation, I feel this experience has made me mentally tougher to face any situation,” the skipper said. Recollecting the time spent at the hospital, the star midfielder said it was mentally tough for him and rest of the infected players to remain in isolation. “It was not easy, especially mentally. I have not done anything for a month and that's a long time in a sportsperson’s career especially when every day is about improving and being the best,” Manpreet said. “To be honest, initially when the results came out, we were slightly stressed. (But)  we received best facilities in the hospital with SAI constantly checking with the medical team there of our well-being.”  ",sports
McDonald says not sure about Stokes availability,"  Rajasthan Royals head coach Andew McDonald says the franchise is ""not sure"" about the availability of star all-rounder Ben Stokes in the upcoming IPL as he is tending to his ailing father in New Zealand. Stokes, hero of England's World Cup triumph last year, is going through a tough phase. He pulled out of the three-match series against Pakistan in August before the second Test to be with his father, diagnosed with brain cancer. “First and foremost, thoughts with the Stokes family. It’s a difficult scenario, so we're giving him as much time as he needs, and connecting with him as best we can,” McDonald was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. “So yeah, we're not sure where Stokesy's at right now, but once it has played out, then we can make our decisions from there. But I don’t want to second-guess what will happen with him just yet.” Since the first Test against Pakistan, the top all-rounder has not played any cricket. Instead, he travelled to New Zealand, where his parents are settled. Stokes’ father Ged, a former New Zealand rugby league international, was admitted to hospital in Johannesburg two days before Christmas last year with a serious illness.  ",sports
Adjusting to UAE conditions will be biggest challenge: Boult,"  Dubai: Set to lead four-time champions Mumbai Indians bowling attack in absence of Lasith Malinga, Kiwi left-arm pacer Trent Boult believes the biggest challenge for all the teams in the 13th IPL will be to adjust to the hot and humid UAE conditions. “The biggest challenge so far has been trying to prepare to come to 45 degrees in the middle of the desert. I come from a very small country New Zealand which is about 7 or 8 degrees at the moment in the middle of winter,” Boult said in a video posted by MI. Having played some amount of cricket in the UAE, Boult believes Mumbai Indians have the firepower in its bowling unit to outwit any opposition in the upcoming IPL. “I’ve played a little bit of cricket here and I’m aware that the conditions can change quite drastically depending on the time of the time of the year etc,” the 31-year-old said. “But I’m hoping for good wickets and if good wickets are on the table, then it’s about being clear with what we are trying to do as a bowling team.

Miller wants to finish games like Dhoni does,"  David Miller is in awe of M S Dhoni’s finishing skills and the South African says he wants to imbibe the former India skipper’s calmness in high-pressure run chases.

Certainly his calmness — you just think he’s always under control. The way he portrays himself, that’s something he’s extremely good at and I do enjoy that about him. I try and give off the same energy,” Miller told ESPNcricinfo. Miller is a Dhoni fan but he is not oblivious to the two-time World Cup winner’s weaknesses even though he prefers to steer clear of the specifics. “...He’s got his strengths and weaknesses as a batsman and so do I. I tend to be in awe of some of his chases rather than ‘I want to bat like him’. I suppose I just want to finish games like he does.  ",sports

Neymar sees red in PSG defeat,"  Neymar was among five players sent off in stoppage time as Marseille beat bitter rival Paris Saint-Germain for the first time in nine years. PSG star Neymar got a straight red in Marseille’s 1-0 win following an altercation with center half Alvaro Gonzalez on Sunday. Neymar was sent off following a video replay showing he aimed a jab to the back of Gonzalez’s head. As he went off, Neymar told officials that he had been racially abused. “It’s a serious wrongdoing if that’s the case but I don’t think so,” Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas said. “What we saw, what was visible, is that (Angel) Di Maria spat (on Gonzalez).” With apparent reference to Gonzalez, Neymar later tweeted “The only regret I have is not hitting the face of this idiot.” In a later tweet, Neymar said “It’s easy for VAR to show my ‘aggression’. ‘Now I’d like to them to show the image of the racist who called me a ‘MONKEY SON OF A BITCH’. I’d really like that!” Winger Florian Thauvin scored in the 31st minute of a tense game featuring more than a dozen yellow cards and which descended into chaos deep into stoppage time as punches and kicks were exchanged. It was Marseille’s first victory over PSG since a 3-0 home win in November 2011. PSG has now lost three straight games 1-0, including the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on Aug 23 and away to promoted Lens last Thursday. PSG lost its opening two league games for the first time since the 1984-85 season and Tuchel may find himself under early pressure. The game ended with PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa and Marseille counterpart Jordan Amavi sent off for fighting in the seventh minute of injury time at Parc des Princes.

Victorian Govt working on getting crowd back for Boxing Day Test & Aus Open,"  Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday said his Government is negotiating with Cricket Australia and Tennis Australia to have crowd attendance for the city’s iconic sports events — Boxing Day Test involving India and the Australian Open. There is speculation that MCG may miss out on hosting the Boxing Day Test, an annual highlight on the calendar, since Victoria is reeling under Covid-19 pandemic. Victoria, which is in lockdown since July, has accounted for 75 percent of cases and 90 percent of Covid deaths in the country. Australia have reported more than 26000 cases and more than 800 deaths. “We just have to work out what a safe crowd would be. It is too hard to say now what that number is,” Andrews said in a daily news briefing. “It is too early for us to determine how big any crowd might be. We will get as many people we can get there, provided it is safe.” More than eight lakh people thronged Melbourne Park for the Australian Open in January and more than two lakh attended the Boxing Day Test between Australia and New Zealand. With Melbourne looking a dicey venue, Adelaide is seen as the front-runner for the Boxing Day Test against India. “We don’t want one event to necessarily set us back and cause us a problem. It is hard for us to predict where virus numbers will be, what risks do we have to deal with in just a few weeks time, let alone months,” said Andrews.  ",sports
Tough one to get your head around: Cummins on loss in second ODI,"  Australia pacer Pat Cummins says the 24-run loss to England in the second ODI here was ""tough one to get your head around"" with his team letting the hosts off the hook twice in the game. From 149 for eight, England went on to make 231 for nine on a surface where runs were hard to come by. Australia then made a good start before a dramatic collapse saw them slip from 144 for two in the run chase to be 207 all-out. The three-match series is now levelled at 1-1. ""I'll get my head around that tomorrow and have a bit of a look at the footage. On that wicket, for 40 overs it felt like a good length was the hardest to hit, and suddenly they started hitting them quite nicely,"" said Cummins after the game on Sunday. ""We'll have a review. If we'd kept them down - those last 10 (overs) went for 80-odd, I think - we're suddenly only chasing 200 and it's a different game. ""It's a tough one to get your head around. I thought we bowled really well and then let them off the hook in the last 10 overs ... we gave them an extra 40 or 50 runs."" It was a slow surface which helped the spinners and Cummins said his team will have to improve its game on pitches like these, something it will encounter in the 2023 World Cup in India. ""Something we always talk about in tournament play and World Cups is that towards the back end, you are likely to get these kind of wickets where spinners (will play a role) and you're not getting 350 that you might get at the start of the tournament,"" he said. ""On a really good wicket, in your death bowling you go to yorkers or slower balls or bouncers. Here it's tossing up what's the hardest ball to hit - is it a yorker or maybe it's top of the stumps? ""Maybe you can keep the fields in for longer, the spinners might have more of an impact. I really enjoy it. It makes you think differently and try and solve problems,"" he said.   ",sports
"Sharma finishes 44th, Coetzee wins fifth European Tour title","  Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma once again allowed his gains to go waste with a bunch of bogeys as he carded an even par 71 in the final round to finish Tied-44th at the Portugal Masters here. The 24-year-old Indian, going through one of the worst patches of his professional career, had four birdies, three of them in four holes between 11th and 14th, but gave them all away with four bogeys, two of which came on 16th and 17th holes. South African George Coetzee displayed superb short game to card his third card of 66 in four days to hold off a strong chasing pack and win the 2020 Portugal Masters by two shots. It was his fifth European Tour title. Coetzee, who started the day with a one hole advantage, ended a winner by two as Laurie Canter (66) was second, while Tommy Fleetwood (64) gave himself a brilliant final round before leaving for the US Open next week. Fleetwood tied for third with Joakim Lagergren (65) and Japan's Masahiro Kawamura (70), who held sole lead at one point was fifth. Sharma, who has made only two cuts in seven starts since the Hero Open on the UK Swing, had no less than 14 birdies he had four or more birdies on second, third and final days, while the first day saw him land a rare albatross. But he also gave away 11 bogeys and two double bogeys. Coetzee, 34, made his first birdie of the day from 20 feet on the difficult seventh before picking up another shot from a similar distance on the short eighth to get to 13-under and regain his one stroke lead. After making another gain from nine feet at the 11th, Coetzee made key par putts on the 12th and 13th to remain in front as the chasing pack began to gather just behind him on an incredibly bunched leaderboard. He then holed brilliant birdie putts at the 16th and 17th to move to 16 under par and give himself a two shot cushion heading to the 18th tee. Coetzee saved his best drive until last and went on to make a nerveless par to win for the second week in a row, having also tasted victory at the Titleist Championship at Pretoria Country Club on the Sunshine Tour last week. Englishman Laurie Canter finished alone in second on 14-under after he also made five birdies in a flawless 66, while his countryman and World Number 16 Tommy Fleetwood was another stroke back in a tie for third with Swede Joakim Lagergren.

"IPL can provide challenging practice to Indian, Aus players ahead of December duel: Chappell","  Former captain Ian Chappell believes playing cricket in COVID-19 era is a lot different from anything experienced in the past, but said the upcoming IPL can provide some ""challenging"" practice to Indian and Australian players ahead of their much-anticipated duel later this year. Indian players will fly directly to Australia after the IPL concludes on November 10 for the high-profile tour which is likely to begin with a T20 series followed by four Tests and ODIs. The IPL begins in Abu Dhabi on September 19. Chappell feels the high-profile T20 event might just be a blessing in disguise for the Indians and the Australians, with just a few series possible since mid-March because of the pandemic. ""One thing is certain: where there's a will, there's a way, and the better players are dedicated to finding a solution,"" Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNcricinfo.com.. ""In case of Indian players, and some of the Australians, they will at least have some challenging IPL cricket in the lead-up to the December series."" Chappell admitted the IPL ""may not seem like ideal preparation for a tough Test series in Australia"" but he recalled the thoughts of former England batsman Ravi Bopara in 2009. ""After a stint in the IPL, Bopara was asked on return to England if this was appropriate preparation for a Test match. He responded by saying that 'looking to score at every opportunity gets your feet moving positively'. He proved his point emphatically by scoring back-to-back centuries against West Indies."" The 76-year-old legend said with a host of health and safety protocols in place, it is difficult for visiting teams to prevail over home sides in the COVID-19 era. ""With venue bubbles, isolation rules, social distancing, and a number of changes to playing conditions, adapting to international competition has been testing for players. It's made life difficult and different even in a team environment but imagine the individual's dilemma in enforced isolation with a tour looming,"" he said. ""The physical preparation is not so difficult, especially for self-starters, but how do you stay in cricket shape?"" But the former captain said the Indians very well understand the stakes associated with the tour of Australia and will leave no stone unturned in their preparations for the series. ""The Indian players could well adopt this attitude for a series in Australia that will impact the Border-Gavaskar trophy, the World Test Championship, and their personal pride. ""It's unlikely India will have the luxury of lead-up matches against tough opposition. More likely it will be intra-squad games, which can be helpful if selection is judicious and pits good bowlers against equally talented batsmen. The downside is the fast bowlers are often wary of injuring their own players,"" he said.

"Naomi Osaka comes back, beats Azarenka for 2nd US Open title","  After one errant forehand in the first set of the US Open final, Naomi Osaka looked at her coach in the mostly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium stands with palms up, as if to say, ""What the heck is happening?"" In response to another wayward forehand against Victoria Azarenka seconds later, Osaka chucked her racket. It spun a bit and rattled against the court. Surprisingly off-kilter in the early going Saturday, Osaka kept missing shots and digging herself a deficit. Until, suddenly, she lifted her game, and Azarenka couldn't sustain her start. By the end, Osaka pulled away to a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory for her second US Open championship and third Grand Slam title overall. ""For me, I just thought,"" said Osaka, who trailed by a set and a break, ""it would be very embarrassing to lose this in an under an hour."" This, then, is what she told herself with a white towel draped over her head at a changeover when things looked bleakest: ""I just have to try as hard as I can and stop having a really bad attitude."" It worked. A quarter-century had passed since a woman who lost the first set of a US Open final wound up winning: In 1994, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario did it against Steffi Graf. ""I wasn't really thinking about winning. I was just thinking about competing,"" Osaka said. ""Somehow, I ended up with the trophy."" Osaka is a 22-year-old who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Haitian father; the family moved to the US when she was 3. Osaka, now based in California, arrived for the US Open intent on claiming the championship, to be sure, but with another goal in mind, as well: continuing to be a voice for change by calling attention to racial injustice. She showed up for Saturday's match wearing a mask with the name of Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old boy killed by police in Ohio in 2014. That was the seventh mask she'd used during the tournament, after honoring other Black victims of violence: Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Philando Castile. ""The point,"" Osaka explained, ""is to make people start talking."" Last month, Osaka refused to compete after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Wisconsin she said she would withdraw from her semifinal at the Western & Southern Open, although decided to play after the tournament took a full day off in solidarity. Osaka and her coach, Wim Fissette who used to work with Azarenka have said they think the off-court activism has helped her energy and mindset in matches. ""I wanted,"" Osaka said, ""more people to (see) more names."" So perhaps it was no coincidence that this win over Azarenka, a 31-year-old from Belarus also seeking a third Grand Slam title but first in 7 years, made Osaka 11-0 since tennis resumed after its hiatus because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Osaka added to her triumphs at the 2018 US Open earned with a brilliant performance in a memorably chaotic and controversial final against Serena Williams and 2019 Australian Open. Azarenka carried an 11-match winning streak of her own into Saturday, including a stirring three-set victory over Williams in the semifinals, stopping the American's bid for a 24th Grand Slam title. Azarenka won the 2012 and 2013 Australian Opens and lost to Williams in the US Open finals each of those years. ""I thought the third time was the charm,"" Azarenka said, ""but I guess I'll have to try again."" Even after Osaka surged ahead 4-1 in the third set, the outcome was unclear. Azarenka drew to 4-3, then stood and stretched during the ensuing changeover. ""Had a little bit of a energy dip,"" Azarenka said. Osaka regained control, then laid down on the court when the final was over. The 23,000-plus seats in the main arena at Flushing Meadows were not entirely unclaimed, just mostly so while fans were not allowed to attend because of the coronavirus pandemic, dozens of people who worked at the tournament attended and the cavernous place was not entirely silent, just mostly so. One of the lucky few in the house: Osaka's boyfriend, rapper YBN Cordae. ""I'm very grateful for the opportunity to play in front of millions of people watching on TV,"" Azarenka said. ""Unfortunately, they're not here."" Certainly no thunderous applause or the cacophony of yells that normally would reverberate over and over and over again through the course of a Grand Slam final, accompanying the players' introductions or preceding the first point or after the greatest of shots. Instead, a polite smattering of claps from several hands marked such moments. Azarenka led early thanks to terrific returning and let-no-ball-by defense, stretching points until Osaka missed. And she repeatedly missed; the first set was over in a blink. Azarenka broke early in the second set, too, to lead 2-0. The question shifted from ""Who will win?"" to ""Might this be the most lopsided US Open final?"" Except Osaka made subtle changes that altered the match. She stepped closer to the baseline, redirecting shots more immediately and forcefully. Azarenka began hitting the ball less stridently, making mistakes she avoided earlier.  ",sports
"Mo Salah, more goals","  Egyptian’s last-minute penalty seals win for Premier League champions! Liverpool began the defence of the league title with 4-3 win in a thrilling game at Anfield. Mo Salah blasted the Reds into the lead from the penalty spot but Jack Harrison levelled things with a smart finish following a brilliant Kalvin Phillips cross-field pass. Virgil van Dijk rose highest unmarked from an Andy Robertson corner to head Liverpool back into the lead. However, the Dutchman was at fault for Leeds’ equaliser as his poor clearance allowed Patrick Bamford to slide the ball past Alisson. Leeds couldn’t hang on again and after failing to clear Andy Robertson’s free-kick properly, Salah powered a shot into the top corner to restore Liverpool’s lead. Helder Costa’s pinpoint pass found Mateusz Klich in the area who brought the score level for a third time. It looked as if Leeds had come away with a stunning opening-day point before Rodrigo’s foul on Fabinho awarded the hosts their second penalty of the game. Salah made no mistake again to earn Liverpool the three points. willian stars Earlier in the first game of the new season, Arsenal made a flying start as Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed a debut goal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a stunner in 3-0 win at Fulham. Arsenal’s free-flowing attack was too incisive for promoted Fulham and Alexandre Lacazette gave the visitors an early lead at Craven Cottage. Brazilian defender Gabriel scored Arsenal’s second after the break in his first appearance since his close-season move from Lille. Aubameyang added the final flourish with a typically eye-catching strike that emphasised why Arsenal are so desperate for the Gabon forward to sign an extension to the contract which expires at the end of the season. Arteta has said that fans concerned Aubameyang will leave can “relax” because he is “very optimistic” his captain will agree a new deal soon. With former Chelsea winger Willian providing a pair of assists on his debut, it was the ideal way for Arsenal to start a season that appears full of promise after last season’s FA Cup triumph.  Although their eighth-placed finish in the Premier League ranked as Arsenal’s lowest final position since 1995, Arteta had little to do with that after taking charge in December following the dismal reign of Unai Emery. The former Manchester City assistant coach has been a much-needed breath of fresh air for Arsenal and pushing for a place in the top four should not be beyond his revitalised team this term. While the continued absence of fans due to the coronavirus and shorter than usual break has taken a little anticipation away from the new campaign, Arsenal were keener than most to get back in action after beating Chelsea in the FA Cup final. The Gunners had underlined their rapid improvement by defeating Premier League champions Liverpool on penalties in the Community Shield last month and Fulham were no match for them.  Crumbling Fulham The only dark cloud for Arteta was a pre-match spat between Dani Ceballos and Eddie Nketiah. The pair had to be separated by Arsenal team-mates after Nketiah reacted to an aggressive challenge from Ceballos while a group of players were exchanging passes in the warm-up. Arteta must have been alarmed when Ainsley Maitland-Niles hit a weak back pass that caused confusion between Gabriel and recalled keeper Bernd Leno early on. Aboubakar Kamara nipped in but Leno managed to save at his feet before the Fulham forward could get a shot away. Arteta’s worries were eased when Lacazette netted in the ninth minute. Granit Xkaha’s strike forced a miscued clearance from Tim Ream and Willian pounced with a close-range shot that Fulham keeper Marek Rodak could only push out to Lacazette, who slotted home from virtually on the goalline.  It made Lacazette the first player to score the opening goal of a Premier League campaign twice after the French striker also bagged the opener in 2017-18. Willian was denied a debut goal when his low free-kick cannoned off the base of the post. Gabriel was enjoying a composed debut and the 22-year-old showed he can be a goal threat as well when he doubled Arsenal's lead in the 49th minute. Willian swung over the corner and Gabriel showed his desire as he rose above Michael Hector for an attempted header that hit his shoulder as it flashed into the net. Fulham’s defence was crumbling like the recently demolished Craven Cottage stand and Aubameyang finished them off in the 57th minute with a carbon copy of his Community Shield goal against Liverpool. Just as at Wembley, Willian’s superb cross-field pass picked out Aubameyang and he was allowed to advance unchecked into the area before bending a fine finish into the far corner.  ",sports

Adelaide names home base,"  The Adelaide Oval’s onsite hotel is set to serve as biosecure bubble for the Australian men’s squad ahead of the high-profile Test series against India later this year. Cricket Australia on Saturday announced that its national squad would return form the current tour of the UK to Adelaide for its mandatory quarantine period and preparation for the upcoming home season, a report in cricket.Com.Au said. Those players not involved in the Indian Premier League, as well as coaching and support staff, will make the Adelaide Oval their home once the white-ball tour of England concludes following Wednesday’s third ODI in Manchester. They can train throughout their quarantine period at the new Oval Hotel based at Adelaide Oval. For Australia players like Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, Marnus Labuschagne and Matthew Wade, the quarantine period at Adelaide Oval biosecure bubble will mark the start of preparation for a Test summer against heavyweights India and potentially Afghanistan.

IPL will set momentum for Down Under: Shami,"  The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the right kind of tournament that allows players to get into the groove nicely, an absolute must before they hit the Australian shores for two and half months, feels Indian team’s premier speedster Mohammed Shami. The Australia-bound India players will fly directly after the IPL concludes on November 10 for the much-anticipated tour which is likely to begin with a T20 series followed by four Tests and ODIs. “It would be great that the Australia-bound players are playing IPL. It will set the body and momentum perfectly by then,” the Kings XI pace spearhead said. India under Virat Kohli achieved the historic feat of winning in Australia for the first time in 2018-19 but the hosts did not have Steve Smith and David Warner back then because of their involvement in the ball tampering scandal. The duo’s presence would make the series even more exciting and Shami said everyone is focused on the tour as well. “I feel it’s better that we are playing IPL before a big series. Apart from IPL, everyone is also focused on that tour (Down Under). There is a lot of talk about that series. We will have a good contest.” With the IPL shifted to the UAE, the tournament will be held across three venues of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, comprising 60 matches spread over 53 days. Shami feels unlike in India where they have to fly all over the country for away matches, the IPL in UAE would be less hectic this time. “Yes, there’re back to back matches, training, travelling that’s a bit of headache. But it’s a short format, short matches, physically there should not be any workload issue. This time, there won’t be much travelling. You will have to travel just about two hours by bus (when there is a match in Abu Dhabi).”  ",sports

Hazlewood stars in Oz win,"  Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood insisted it was a case of “onwards and upwards” after he starred in a 19-run win over world champions England in the first ODI at Old Trafford on Friday. Hazlewood took a miserly 3-26 from his maximum 10 overs that stifled England’s pursuit of a target of 295 from the outset, removing opener Jason Roy and Test skipper Joe Root for single figure scores as the hosts limped to 22-2 off the first 10 overs. This was Australia’s first 50-over match against England since a crushing eight-wicket defeat by their arch-rivals in the semi-finals of last year’s World Cup at Edgbaston. Hazlewood, however, didn’t play in that match after being controversially omitted from the World Cup squad, with the selectors instead wanting him to regain full fitness following a back injury for the subsequent Ashes in England. Asked if the way he bowled on Friday made his World Cup absence all the more painful, Hazlewood replied: “Nah it’s onwards and upwards. That’s a long time ago now, so always looking forward.” The 29-year-old was close to unplayable during a stunning opening spell of two wickets for five runs in six overs. “England’s top order is probably the form top order in the world in the last three or four years, so I guess going against them is a good measure of where you’re at,” Hazlewood said after what was just Australia’s third win in 14 ODIs against their oldest foe. “To keep them down to 20-odd for two in the first 10 was great.” Meanwhile England captain Eoin Morgan said Hazlewood had enjoyed a “day out” after his side went 1-0 down in a three-match series that continues on Sunday. “They (Australia) were outstanding, incredibly accurate and they got the ball moving,” he said. “It’s not often it happens to us.” ‘Keeping Stokesy’s chair warm’ Sam Billings kept England in the game with 118, his maiden ODI hundred, after sharing a century partnership with Jonny Bairstow (84) following the hosts’ collapse to 57-4. Billings was the only member of England’s XI on Friday not involved in the World Cup squad, with his inclusion owing much to star all-rounder Ben Stokes still being on compassionate leave with his ill father. Billings, reflecting on his “mixed feelings” at making a hundred in a losing cause, told Sky Sports he was keen to “keep putting scores on the board” after what was just his 19th ODI appearance in a five-year England career. The 29-year-old Kent batsman added, however: “I don’t think it matters how many runs I get, I know I’m only keeping Stokesy’s chair warm for him.” Morgan, however, insisted Billings had batted brilliantly on the back of “sporadic” chances caused by the fact he, as well as Jos Buttler and Stokes, had often been at No 6 instead. “But today he (Billings) really stood out in a spot that is really difficult to bat, where you can be thrown in at all different circumstances,” said Morgan.

"Zvonareva, Siegemund win women’s doubles","  Vera Zvonareva and Laura Siegemund stood awkwardly facing each other, rackets and arms in the air in confusion. Finally, Siegemund turned to the chair umpire for a ruling. “Are we allowed to give a hug?” she asked. The rules of tennis during the coronavirus pandemic were the only thing Zvonareva and Siegemund couldn’t figure out in their first tournament together. The duo won the US Open women’s doubles title on Friday, beating the third-seeded team of Xu Yifan and Nicole Melichar 6-4, 6-4. Zvonareva and Siegemund collected $400,000 — and also their hug — by racing to quick leads in both sets and holding on when their opponents began to play better. Unseeded after deciding to play together shortly before the tournament, Zvonareva and Siegemund found their games worked together and plan to partner again at the upcoming French Open. “I felt like the third match we really started communicating well, we really started to understand each other,” Zvonareva said. “Yeah, it just got better and better from there on.” Zvonareva, a Russian who turned 36 this week, added this title to the 2006 US Open trophy she won with Nathalie Dechy. She also was the runner-up in singles at Flushing Meadows in 2010, falling to Kim Clijsters, and rose to a career-high singles ranking of No 2 the following month. She also won the 2012 Australian Open doubles title but later battled injuries and began playing less, especially after giving birth to daughter Evelina in 2016. As for Xu and Melichar, they finished second for the second straight tournament in New York. The pair was runners-up at the Western & Southern Open that’s usually played in Ohio.        ",sports
"5 sets, two fighters, one winner","  For two full sets, Alexander Zverev was confused and listless, his body language as poor as his winner-to-error ratio against Pablo Carreño Busta in the US Open semifinals on Friday. Zverev double-faulted and smacked his left high. He put a backhand into the net to cede the opening set and covered his face with both hands. He netted a forehand early in the next set, then turned a forlorn face toward his guest box and put his palms up. When he pushed a backhand long after 1 hour, 25 minutes of play and shook his head, Zverev trailed by two sets, a deficit the 23-year-old German never had overcome. Never had been to a Grand Slam final, either. Done and done. Zverev constructed quite a comeback, getting his game in gear to beat a fading Carreño Busta 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 and reach the title match at Flushing Meadows. Zverev, the No 5 seed, will play No 2 seed Dominic Thiem on Sunday, and one will walk away with his first Grand Slam trophy in a mostly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium; spectators were barred because of the coronavirus pandemic . “Mentally, I stayed in it. ... A lot of players would have gone away,” Zverev said. ""There’s no easy matches anymore. Sometimes you have to dig deep. Today I dug deep, dug very deep.” Thiem, a 27-year-old from Austria, won a far more entertaining match on Friday night, holding off 2019 US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (5). Medvedev held a set point in both the second and third, but Thiem hung in there both times and now will try to improve his 0-3 record in Grand Slam finals. He has lost to Rafael Nadal at the French Open the past two years and to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open this February. “I love these big matches — even more when there’s a full stadium, but it’s also great in front of many, many TV spectators,” Thiem said. “To face the best guys in the world, that’s what I do the hard work for all the time at home and in the offseason.” The No 3-seeded Medvedev hadn’t dropped a set all tournament until facing Thiem. He’d been broken just three times, a total Thiem matched by Friday’s second set. After conceding first set, Medvedev went up an early break in the second and was two points from taking it while ahead 5-3 and Thiem serving at love-30, but couldn’t came through. Medvedev held a set point at 6-5 in the tiebreaker and faltered again, even though Thiem felt something in his right heel while chasing a drop shot. Thiem began limping and wincing and was worked on by a trainer before the third set. His team also sent him some fresh shoes, but after he slipped behind the baseline on one point, Thiem shouted in German, clearly miffed. After the match, Thiem said he was pain-free. Medvedev was a point away from taking the third set at 5-3, 40-30, but framed a forehand. “I lost the most important points,” Medvedev lamented, “and that’s how he got the win.” Zverev is the first man to win a US Open semifinal after a 2-0 set deficit since Djokovic did it against Roger Federer in 2011 — and, keeping good company, he’s also the youngest male finalist at any major tournament since Djokovic was 23 in New York in 2010. Zverev’s first trip to a major semifinal came in January at the Australian Open, where he was eliminated by Thiem, who leads their head-to-head series 7-2. “A great friendship, a great rivalry,” Thiem said. A day after a pair of well-played and competitive women’s semifinals — won by Naomi Osaka and Victoria Azarenka, who face each other Saturday night for the championship — Carreño Busta vs Zverev offered little in the way of those characteristics for two sets. “A big opportunity,” the 20th-seeded Carreño Busta called it. Zverev simply kept missing the mark, even on neutral balls. Yet after totaling 25 winners and 36 unforced errors over the first two sets, Zverev had 46 winners and just 21 unforced errors over the last three. “I started taking the ball much earlier. I started taking the ball more on the rise. I started giving myself the chance to be the one that is aggressive,” Zverev explained. “I think in the first few sets, Pablo was the one dictating much more than I did. This is how the match slowly turned around.” Undeterred when Carreño Busta twice hit balls right at him during points in the fourth set, Zverev could throw his head back and allow himself a wide smile at the end.

Klopp unhappy with removal of five-sub rule,"  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp branded the decision to not extend the use of five substitutes in the Premier League as a lack of common sense as he voiced his concerns for player welfare in a congested season. The Reds begin the defence of their Premier League title at home to Leeds on Saturday in a campaign that is starting a month later than normal due to the three-month halt to last season caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Both domestic cup competitions in England have been retained, while Liverpool are among the clubs who will face six Champions League group games in seven weeks between late October and early December. Despite the fixture pile up, the Premier League has not followed the example of other major European leagues in extending a temporary rule after the resumption of last season that allowed matchday squads to increase from 18 to 20 and managers to make five substitutions instead of three. “We press a normal season into a shorter period which will be a proper challenge, especially with the wonderful rule we set up with 18 (players) and three (substitutes),” Klopp said on Friday. “It’s only about player welfare, nothing else, but I don’t know why we have to discuss it at all and not everybody says yes of course, like the whole world is doing, at least the whole of Europe!” Two votes on the rule found a majority of Premier League clubs were against the rule being extended with those nearer the bottom of the table fearing it gave the bigger clubs with better squads an even greater advantage. “I thought from a common sense point of view that for this year, only this year not forever, that we would have 20 and five,” added Klopp. “What I really don’t like is that we deal with this thing based on the wrong facts. “It is not about having advantages, it is about player welfare and about having the highest quality in the games for all teams. I was really surprised when I heard the league decided against it.”  ",sports

Naomi has done it again,"  Helped by net, bad call, she beats Brady to reach her second US final It wasn’t until Naomi Osaka got a little help from a fortunate net-cord and an incorrect line call that she finally was able to get the better of Jennifer Brady in a US Open semifinal filled with fast serves and strong forehands. And now Osaka, still just 22, is one victory away from a third Grand Slam title. Osaka finally surged ahead midway through the last set with the only service break she would get on Thursday night — and only she would need — to beat Brady 7-6 (1), 3-6, 6-3, returning to the final at Flushing Meadows two years after winning the championship. “It means a lot for me. I kind of consider New York my second home,” said Osaka, who was born in Japan and moved to the United States as a child. “I kind of love the atmosphere, even though there’s no people here. I feel like this court kind of suits me well.” Suited both players just fine for most of the high-quality semifinal. Osaka served at up to 120 mph; Brady reached 117 mph. And they pounded the ball once it was in play, too, particularly off the forehand side. “I just felt like I was sticking it out. It felt like we were trading serves,” Osaka said. “I tried to adjust a little bit on her serve in the third set so maybe that helped.” They combined for 70 winners — 35 apiece — to just 42 unforced errors, each as good as the other, and it took a bit of luck to swing things after 1 hour, 45 minutes. That’s when, at 2-1 in the third set, Osaka earned her first break point with a backhand that clipped the net tape and trickled over. She was able to convert the chance when she hit a deep return of a 110 mph serve, and Brady’s backhand in response was called long — although a television replay showed it actually caught a piece of the back of the baseline. Brady did not challenge the ruling. Ashe is one of only two courts at the US Open using line judges this year; to reduce the number of people on site, the tournament used electronic line-calling in the other arenas.  ",sports

"Sharma lands rare albatross, but cards 73, lies 93rd in Spain","  A rare albatross on the penultimate hole of the opening round brought Indian golfer Shunhankar Sharma to par in one swoop but the double bogey on the last one spoilt the effort at the 2020 Portugal Masters. Sharma experienced ecstasy and agony on successive holes as he closed with two-over 73 to lie at Tied-93 on Thursday. Sharma, who is going through a lean patch, opened the round late in the afternoon with a bogey on Par-4 first. He got his first birdie on the fourth, but a double bogey on the seventh saw him turn in 2-over 37. On the back nine a bogey on 11th pushed him further down to 3-over. As the round came closer to the end, Sharma's 2-Iron from 241 yards on the 588 yard par 17th hole found its way into the cup for a rare albatross. It was the first albatross on the 2020 Race to Dubai. But he finished with his second double bogey of the day on 18th for a 74. Last year at the Memorial on PGA Tour, Sharma had a similar albatross in the second round. Liam Johnston produced the lowest round of his European Tour career at Dom Pedro Victoria Golf Course, firing a sparkling round of 61 to lead by one shot at the end of the opening day. At nine under par through 16 holes the Scot was in contention to match the historic 59 Oliver Fisher shot here two years ago. England's Laurie Canter is at seven under par after a round of 64, as all of the leading three players went bogey-free in Vilamoura.

Down but NEVER out,"  Serena rallies to win second and third sets in convincing fashion over Pironkova They were just two particular points from Serena Williams’ latest three-set comeback at the US Open, yet they were pivotal and consisted of the sorts of lengthy exchanges filled with athleticism and brilliance that in any other, non-pandemic year would be marked by thousands of folks rising to their feet for delirious roars and raucous applause. She needed both of these points, one of which included a shot she hit left-handed, to reverse a deficit that reached the scale of a set and a break after 45 minutes of her quarterfinal against Tsvetana Pironkova on a cloudy Wednesday in empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. Williams needed both of these points during a five-game, match-altering run — along with 20 aces, her most in a match in eight years — to end up on the right side of a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 score after more than two hours to get to the semifinals at Flushing Meadows for an 11th consecutive appearance. “It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish, right?” Williams said. Two more victories would allow her to claim a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title. “In the beginning, I was a little fatigued, for whatever reason,” Williams said.      “Obviously, I can’t do that if I want to keep winning, so I need to figure that out.” How big an upset would this have been if Pironkova had held on? Not only is she not seeded at Flushing Meadows, she doesn’t even appear in the WTA rankings at all — this was her first tournament of any sort in more than three years, because she left the tour to become a mother. “It’s unbelievable,” Williams said about Pironkova’s impressive return to competition. “Wow. I couldn’t even do that.” When the players stepped out onto the court, the stadium announcer — announcing for whom, exactly, was something of a mystery — referred to Pironkova, a 32-year-old from Bulgaria, as “Alexander’s mom” and then to Williams as “Olympia’s mom” during the pre-match introductions. “It just shows me how tough moms are,” Williams said afterward. “You play a match and you go home and you’re still changing diapers,” said Williams, whose daughter turned 3 on Sept 1 and is a little older than Pironkova’s son. “It’s like a double life. It’s really surreal.” The American, who turns 39 in less than three weeks, has won six US Open championships; she was the runner-up the past two years. Williams last lost before the semifinals in New York in 2007, when Justine Henin eliminated her in the quarterfinals. On Thursday, Williams will face Victoria Azarenka, who returned to the US Open semifinals for the first time since 2013 by overwhelming Elise Mertens 6-1, 6-0 on Wednesday night. Williams leads her head-to-head series against Azarenka 18-4, including beating her in the 2012 and 2013 finals in New York. The other women’s semifinal on Thursday will be 2018 champion Naomi Osaka vs No 28 seed Jennifer Brady.  ",sports
Vettel signs for Racing Point,"  Four-time Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel will drive for Racing Point starting next season. The team, which will be renamed Aston Martin, announced the move on Thursday, a day after driver Sergio Perez said he was on his way out. The team said Vettel has signed for the 2021 season “and beyond” but did not reveal the length of the contract. “The signing of Sebastian is a clear statement of the team’s ambition to establish itself as one of the most competitive names in the sport,” the team said in a statement. “As a four-time world champion, Sebastian brings a fresh mindset to the team.” One of the most successful drivers in F1, Vettel is leaving Ferrari at the end of this season after he was not offered a new contract. He will be replaced by McLaren driver Carlos Sainz at Ferrari next year. Vettel has won 53 grand prix races, a tally only surpassed by Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton. He won four consecutive titles with Red Bull from 2010-13 and joined Ferrari in 2015 with the aim to win another. But he never had a car really capable of challenging Mercedes during his stint with the Scuderia, where he lost his No 1 status as teammate Charles Leclerc came to prominence. “It’s a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company,” Vettel said. “I have been impressed with the results the team has achieved this year and I believe the future looks even brighter. I still have so much love for Formula 1 and my only motivation is to race at the front of the grid.”  ",sports
Dominance personified,"  Not only had 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev not dropped a set in this US Open entering his all-Russian quarterfinal against long-time pal Andrey Rublev, but Medvedev hadn’t allowed more than four games in any set. So when Rublev grabbed a sizable lead in the opening-set tiebreaker on Wednesday and three times was a single point from closing it, the moment felt momentous. Turned out it was. The No 3-seeded Medvedev fought off that trio of chances for No 10 Rublev in the tiebreaker by reeling off five points in a row, and was on his way to a 7-6 (6), 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory to return to the semifinals at Flushing Meadows. The only concern for Medvedev in the latter stages was whether his body would hold up — he was dealing with cramps and needed his right shoulder massaged by a trainer in the third set — but he did, indeed, hold on. “It was tough at the end,” Medvedev said. It’s been 60 years since a man won this Grand Slam tournament without ceding a set; Neale Fraser did so in 1960 at the event then known as the US Championships. A year after losing to Rafael Nadal in a five-set final that lasted nearly five hours, Medvedev heads to his second career major semifinal. He will now face No 2 seed Dominic Thiem for the title showdown place, who bulldozed 21st seed Alex de Minaur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in just 2 hours 4 minutes. The other semifinal on Friday will be No 5 Alexander Zverev vs No 20 Pablo Carreño Busta, who won quarterfinals on Tuesday. None of the remaining men has won a Grand Slam title.  ",sports

'It's how you finish': Serena Williams into Open semifinals,"  They were just two particular points from Serena Williams' latest three-set comeback at the U.S. Open, yet they were pivotal and consisted of the sorts of lengthy exchanges filled with athleticism and brilliance that in any other, non-pandemic year would be marked by thousands of folks rising to their feet for delirious roars and raucous applause. She needed both of these points, one of which included a shot she hit left-handed, to reverse a deficit that reached the scale of a set and a break after 45 minutes of her quarterfinal against Tsvetana Pironkova on a cloudy Wednesday in empty Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Williams leads her head-to-head series against Azarenka 18-4, including beating her in the 2012 and 2013 finals in New York. It was in a 2012 match against Azarenka at Wimbledon that Williams last topped 20 aces, producing 24. The other women's semifinal Thursday will be 2018 champion Naomi Osaka vs. No. 28 seed Jennifer Brady. In the men's quarterfinals Wednesday, 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev beat No. 10 Andrey Rublev 7-6 (6), 6-3, 7-6 (5) to return to the final four, with No. 2 Dominic Thiem against No. 21 Alex de Minaur scheduled to meet at night. Medvedev hasn't dropped a set in the tournament. Williams also needed a comeback and the maximum number of sets to get through the fourth round before defeating 15th-seeded Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3. In Wednesday's turnaround, the first key moment involved 24 strokes, the next-to-last a cross-court forehand by Williams from wide of the doubles alley, and the last an on-the-run squash forehand by Pironkova that landed in the net. That gave Williams a break and a 5-3 edge in the second set. Williams raised her left fist as her husband yelled from his front-row corner seat; Pironkova put a hand on her knee, smiled ruefully and squatted behind the baseline. The other came in a four-deuce opening game of the final set, and began with the right-handed Williams taking a page out of old friend Maria Sharapova's playbook by hitting a left-handed return of serve. Another 15 strokes followed, with Williams smacking a forehand passing shot that Pironkova volleyed into the net tape. That was intense, Williams said. I was just trying to do everything I can whether righty or lefty. Pironkova dropped onto her back, chest heaving; she left so much sweat on the court that a ball person was beckoned to wipe it away with a towel. That afforded Williams a third break point, which was converted for a 1-0 lead when Pironkova sent a forehand long. She definitely played like the champion she is, Pironkova said. Williams then only added to the lead, her strokes finding targets better the longer the match went on. Her serve was especially good, as it usually is. In contrast, Pironkova began to have more trouble on the longer points that she dominated early; she won the first half-dozen that lasted 10 strokes or more before Williams found more success. A couple of times, Pironkova drew Williams forward with a drop shot, then took the point with a perfectly arced lob. I tried everything, Pironkova said. But after compiling only five unforced errors in the first set, Pironkova had 21 over the last two. Williams, in contrast, made 11 in the first set, just 13 the rest of the way. Definitely, the first set, I think I was in control of the match. I was doing all kinds of shots, and everything went ... my way, Pironkova said. But, you know, I was expecting (that) it's not going to last forever.   ",sports
Hazlewood hoping for ''enough red-ball cricket'' before first India Test,"  Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood is hoping to get enough game time in red-ball cricket before the first Test against India later this year and has expressed a desire to see the series opener being played in ""lucky"" Brisbane. India are scheduled to tour Australia for a four-match Test series later this year. Considering the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said even a practice game against Australia A squad would work well with him. ""The summer is becoming a bit clearer as the days go by and I'm sure we'll get enough red-ball cricket before that first Test, whether it's Australia versus Australia A or something like that,"" he was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo. ""I'm quite happy with just one long-form game, I feel like that's enough for me to get up and running. That's what I've done last five or six years, one Shield game and straight into the Test matches."" Hazlewood admitted his teammates would ideally like to start the Test series in Brisbane, where Australia have not lost since 1988. ""Things are out of our control a bit at the moment. Obviously, we'd love to start in Brizzy with our great record there,"" he said. ""We play well there and sort of get on a role, but this year will be a lot different. We love playing in Adelaide whether it's red ball or pink and it's always a great wicket."" The series India won two years ago started in Adelaide, where the visitors won, and Brisbane was not among the venues. Hazlewood is among many Australian players, including fellow paceman Pat Cummins, who will head from the ongoing tour of England to the IPL, where he has a contract with Chennai Super Kings, before returning home in early or mid-November. The pacer, who played his first T20I in four years on Tuesday, said he has adjusted to the game's shortest format. ""I feel comfortable in the format, have been working on a few things and they seem to be going well."" he said. ""Hopefully I get a few games for Chennai this year and every time I get out there in T20 just keep taking the opportunity.""  ",sports
"CSK have experience and quality, I believe we have a great chance: Watson","  The experience and quality of Chennai Super Kings' battle-hardened players should see the team through in the upcoming IPL despite a turbulent build-up caused by 13 COVID-19 cases in the contingent, feels veteran all-rounder Shane Watson. The CSK unit was rocked by 13 cases of the dreaded disease barely weeks before the September 19 tournament-opener and the list also included two players. This resulted in an extended quarantine period and a delayed start to their outdoor training session. ""Having an experienced team means your players have more understanding of being able to get their skills to execute under pressure from game one,"" Watson said on Nabeel Hashmi's YouTube show. Hashmi is the head of player acquisitions at the Quetta Gladiators, Watson's team in the Pakistan Super League. The former Australian all-rounder added, ""That is why we believe we've got a great chance of having a great year because of the quality of players and the experience we've got. ""We've got more chance of not making many mistakes trying to get up to speed as quickly as we possibly can."" As one of T20 leagues' biggest freelancers, Watson has been playing across the world for the past few seasons, and he is banking on that experience to shine in his next assignment. ""I've sort of been away playing T20 tournaments on and off for the last four years or so,"" he said. ""I have more of an understanding (now) but still it's a challenge to be able to get your skills up."" Watson also praised CSK's ""world class"" leadership group for backing him during an up-and-down last season. ""The 2018 season was one of my better seasons, it wasn't just the final (where Watson made a match-winning century). ""But last year, certainly CSK stuck with me through thick and thin. In every other team that I've been in, I may have been dropped a couple of games before I got the runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. ""Just them backing me, knowing my next few good innings were around the corner, (was amazing). Only world-class leaders will really stick by and have the confidence to do that, given the calibre of the players we've got."" Watson called it a great learning.

Centurion,"  Ronaldo breaches 100-goal mark for Portugal with brace against Sweden Cristiano Ronaldo scored a stunning brace to take him to 101 international goals for Portugal in a 2-0 victory over 10-man Sweden in the Nations League on Tuesday, while France won a repeat of the 2018 World Cup final 4-2 over Croatia. Ronaldo broke the mythical 100-goal mark on the stroke of half-time, the 35-year-old Juventus attacker curling in a free-kick from 25 yards over the wall and into the far left corner beyond Sweden’s stranded goalkeeper Robin Olsen for a memorable milestone in his trophy-laden career. The bonus second goal, and his 101st, came in the 72nd minute, the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward cutting back inside the Swedish defence and producing a deft finish into the far corner from 20 yards. “They are two important goals because it means I managed to reach this mark I’d been seeking,” Ronaldo told Portuguese public television RTP. “I’m very happy, first because the team won and of course to score the 100th and then the 101st, two great goals.” While acknowledging health came first, he lamented the Covid-19 enforced empty stadium. “It’s sad playing without fans, it’s like going to the circus with no clowns or into a garden with no flowers,” Ronaldo said. “Speaking for myself, when I play away matches I like being whistled, it gives me motivation.” After making his first senior international appearance as an 18-year-old in 2003, Ronaldo notched up his first goal for Portugal in a 2-1 defeat by eventual winners Greece at Euro 2004. Ronaldo, capped 165 times by Portugal, is second only to Iran’s Ali Daei, on 109, in the list of top men’s international goal scorers. “The record, it’s step by step,” Ronaldo said. “It’s not an obsession because I think records come naturally.” Incredibly for Ronaldo, just 17 of his 100 goals have come in friendly matches, and his nine hat-tricks all came in FIFA or UEFA tournaments or qualifying games. GIROUD NEARS RECORD Oliver Giroud moved to within one goal of Michel Platini’s national record for France by converting a penalty to complete the victory over Croatia at the Stade de France. The striker was handed the opportunity to move onto 40 international goals by Antoine Griezmann, who gave away penalty duties having missed his last three for France. Giroud made no mistake in the 77th minute. A well-taken individual goal by center back Dejan Lovren put Croatia ahead, but Anthony Martial set up Griezmann for the equalizer before sliding in for a shot that hit the post, struck goalkeeper Livakovic on the back of the head, and rebounded into the net. Josip Brekalo made it 2-2, only for defender Dayot Upamecano to regain the lead for France before Giroud’s penalty. Eduardo Camavinga came on for his France debut during the second half, becoming the youngest player to represent France since the second world war at 17 years, 10 months. Belgians thrash Iceland FIFA’s number one ranked side Belgium, led superbly by Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, handed Iceland a 5-1 drubbing to follow up on their 2-0 win over Denmark. The Islanders actually opened the scoring through an 11th-minute deflected shot from Holmbert Fridjonsson. But a reshuffled Red Devils outfit hit back almost immediately through Axel Witsel in the 13th minute, before a Michy Batshuayi double (17, 70) coupled with goals from Dries Mertens (50) and new cap Jeremy Doku (80) combined to put the game out of sight. Belgium’s win moves them to the top of League A Group 2 ahead of their trip next month to England, who were lucky to escape with a 0-0 draw away to Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday. The best opportunities to break the deadlock for both sides came in the final 10 minutes as firstly Christian Eriksen blazed over from Yussuf Poulsen’s cushioned header. At the other end, his former Tottenham teammate Harry Kane thought he had notched the winner deep in stoppage time as he rounded Kaspar Schmeichel and fired goalwards only for Mathias Jorgensen to make a brilliant goal-line clearance.

Nowhere near guys like Kohli: Malan,"  England batsman Dawid Malan is not a sure starter despite averaging close to 50 in T20Is and says he can only be compared to guys like Virat Kohli if he played at least 50 games.

"Yuvraj decides to come out of retirement, writes to BCCI","  World Cup-winning former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has decided to come out of retirement, giving in to a request from the Punjab Cricket Association more than a year after he called it quits. The Player of the Tournament at the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket last June. PCA secretary Puneet Bali was the first person to approach the 38-year-old Yuvraj with an offer to come out of retirement for the benefit of Punjab cricket. ""Initially, I wasn't sure that I wanted to take up the offer,"" Yuvraj was quoted as saying by 'Cricbuzz'. ""I was done with domestic cricket, though I did want to continue to play in other domestic franchise-based leagues worldwide if I got permission from the BCCI. ""But I also couldn't ignore Mr Bali's request. I gave it a lot of thought, for nearly three or four weeks, and it was almost as if I didn't even have to make a conscious decision in the end."" While working with the young Punjab quartet of Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Prabhsimran Singh and Anmolpreet Singh at the nets in the last few months, Yuvraj rediscovered his love and motivation for the game. Bali told PTI that the dashing southpaw has written to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly in this regard. ""I know he has written a letter to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly wanting to come out of retirement,"" he revealed. ""We want him in the team and the way he mentored four young boys Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Prabh Simran Singh and Anmolpreet Singh was exceptional. I told him that please give at least one more year of your life to Punjab cricket,"" said. This is another twist to a career that has been punctuated with heroics on the cricket field that saw him win innumerable trophies, player of the tournaments awards, a battle with cancer and a comeback after enduring the ordeal when the world thought Yuvraj was done and dusted with. Delighted with chatter around his comeback, Bali said, ""Punjab cricket needs him. He still has a lot to give as player and mentor. What I know is that he had written to dada two weeks ago. The response must have come by now."" Yuvraj's mother Shabnam Singh, a constant pillar of support in his life, said he still retains the passion for the game. ""He is coming back (fro Dubai) in a couple of days time and then we are going to have a long chat around all of this. Whatever you are hearing must be true,"" Shabnam told PTI. On Tuesday, there was buzz that he was eyeing a stint in the Big Bash League and Cricket Australia is trying to help him find a team. As per BCCI rules, only retired cricketers can play overseas leagues. During his long international career, Yuvraj regaled all with his explosive batting, brilliant fielding and his more than handy left-arm spin bowling. When contacted by PTI, his father Father Yograj Singh said, ""He retired after 20 years of competitive cricket last year and it was his personal decision which I didn't interfere. But even then I felt that he shouldn't have retired."" ""He is a giver. In these times, in scorching heat, he trained Shubman, Prabh and Abhishek for five hours each day. ""The way he hit sixes at the new PCA stadium in Mullanpur, everyone wanted him to come back. If he plays at least three years for punjab, he will give back at two 2 world-class players to Indian cricket. So he must play.""  ",sports
"T20I rankings: Rahul & Kohli remain in top 10, Malan moves to No. 1","  India's KL Rahul and Virat Kohli have been able to remain in top 10 of the ICC T20I player rankings for batsmen which got updated on Wednesday. While Rahul has lost two spots to move down to number four, skipper Kohli has moved up to the ninth position. England batsman Dawid Malan has seized the numero uno spot after a fruitful home series against Australia, which the hosts won 2-1. The 33-year-old left-hander has progressed four places after a series-topping run aggregate of 129, which included a player of the match effort of 66 in the first fixture. Malan, whose previous best ranking was second in November last year, is now eight rating points ahead of Pakistan's Babar Azam. Malan's teammates Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler have also made headway in Wednesday's update. Bairstow has gained three slots to reach a career-best 19th position after scoring 72 runs in the series while Buttler has moved from 40th to 28th after scoring 121 runs in two matches, which also won him the player of the series award.

Dominant win,"  No 3 Thiem cruises into last eight, Medvedev sets up all-Russian QF tie Don’t tell Dominic Thiem the US Open is diminished in any way just because it’s the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2004 French Open without at least one of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. “It doesn’t matter at all if the Big Three are here or not,” the No 2-seeded Thiem said on Monday after beating No 15 Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (4), 6-1, 6-1 in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows. “Everybody wants their hands on the trophy,” said Thiem, who won almost half of Auger-Aliassime’s service points, 46 of 88. “It doesn’t really matter who they’re going to beat.” Djokovic — seeded No 1, unbeaten this season and the overwhelming favorite — was disqualified on Sunday after unintentionally hitting a line judge in the throat with a ball after dropping a game in the first set against Pablo Carreño Busta. Nadal (pandemic concerns) and Federer (two knee operations) did not enter the tournament at all. This ends a run of 13 consecutive major championships won by a member of the Big Three. “It’s been getting pretty boring,” said Denis Shapovalov, the first Canadian man to reach the US Open quarterfinals, “with these three guys winning every tournament.” None of the men left has ever earned so much as one Slam trophy yet. The quarterfinals on the bottom half of the draw will be Thiem against No 21 Alex de Minaur; and No 10 Andrey Rublev against No 3 Daniil Medvedev. On the top half, where Djokovic used to loom: No 12 Shapovalov vs No 20 Carreño Busta; No 5 Alexander Zverev vs No 27 Borna Coric. Medvedev was runner-up to Nadal last year, losing in five sets. He hasn’t dropped a set while advancing to the quarterfinals and he’s dropped serve only three times. “I’m playing better every match,” Medvedev said. “I hope this can continue. I’m pleased, actually, with the fact I’ve won all the sets.” Thiem is the only remaining man who has contested multiple major finals. He is 0-3, losing twice to Nadal at the French Open and to Djokovic at the Australian Open this February. “I am probably one of the oldest players left in the field,” said the 27-year-old Thiem, “which is surreal to me.” Second oldest, actually: Carreño Busta is 29. It’s the first US Open since 2010 without at least one male quarterfinalist who is 30 or older. Next up for Thiem is the 21-year-old de Minaur, who reached his first major quarterfinal by saving four set points in the opening tiebreaker and going on to a 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-2 victory over Vasek Pospisil. Pospisil led 6-2 in the tiebreaker when it all fell apart. “The momentum definitely changed after that,” de Minaur said. Pospisil, who is 30, praised his younger opponent’s court coverage, saying he thinks de Minaur might be the second-fastest player on tour. “What’s most impressive is he never breathes. He runs side to side and he's never out of breath,” Pospisil said. “He defies the laws of biology, I guess. He's a freak of nature.”  ",sports
Serena survives scare,"  Serena Williams had to summon up every last ounce of strength to depose 15th seed Maria Sakkari in three hard-fought sets on Monday. The 38-year-old American needed almost two and a half hours to dislodge her 25-year-old Greek opponent 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3 inside an empty Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York. “She’s such a good competitor. It was a really intense match,” said Williams, who had been dumped out of a US Open tuneup tournament by the same opponent last month. “I felt like she almost played better today. I was a little fatigued last time and had some cramps. Just felt like I was able to compete longer,” Williams added. Williams rallied from two games down in the deciding set, pumping herself up with loud screams that echoed around the spectator-free arena as she broke Sakkari twice to clinch the last-eight spot. “I’m super passionate. This is my job. This is what I wake up to do. This is what I train to do 365 days of the year,” Williams said afterwards. The American will play Tsvetana Pironkova for a place in the semi-finals after the Bulgarian ousted Alize Cornet in another draining three-setter.   Pironkova rolls on Pironkova, who is playing her first tournament in three years after a lengthy break during which she gave birth to her son, prevailed 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 at the Louis Armstrong Stadium. “It’s absolutely unreal, I really can’t believe it,” said Pironkova, whose last tournament appearance before this year’s US Open was the 2017 Wimbledon championships when she exited in the second round. Also, unseeded Victoria Azarenka came from a set down to oust 20th seed Karolina Muchova 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 in 2hr 30min. However, second seed Sofia Kenin was sent crashing out of the tournament, beaten in straight sets by Elise Mertens. Kenin, the highest seeded player left in the fray and winner of the 2020 Australian Open, was bundled out of the last 16 6-3, 6-3, in 1hr 14 mins by Mertens. Mertens, the 16th seed, will now play Victoria Azarenka in the quarter-finals.  ",sports
France striker Mbappe tests positive for virus,"  France and Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss Tuesday's Nations League match against Croatia, the French federation said. Mbappe was isolated once he found out about his positive test and left France's training camp to return home on Monday evening. The French federation said the test was carried out by UEFA in the morning. Mbappe scored for France to beat Sweden 1-0 in the Nations League on Saturday, his 14th international goal. The federation said Mbappe passed a test before joining his teammates at the national training cap. He also tested negative on Wednesday ahead of the game against Sweden.  ",sports
Bopanna-Shapovalov pair ousted from US Open,"  The Indian challenge came to an end at the US Open with the quarterfinal loss of Rohan Bopanna and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov in the men's doubles event here. Bopanna and Shapovalov lost 5-7 5-7 to Dutch Jean-Julien Rojer and Romania's Horea Tecau in the last-eight match which lasted one hour and 26 minutes on Monday. Bopanna and Shapovalov lost their serve once in each set and could not convert the only break chance that came their way in the second set. It was Bopanna's best performance at a Slam since he made the quarterfinals at both the US Open and the French Open in 2018. Divij Sharan and Sumit Nagal have already exited from the tournament following defeats in their respective events.

No!whack,"  Djoker hits lines woman by mistake, rules show the door The way Novak Djokovic was playing on the tennis court in 2020 — before and after (even during) the shutdown caused by a pandemic — something extraordinary had to happen for him to lose a match. And it did. On Sunday at the 2020 US Open, already being played in eerie circumstances in New York, the world No 1 was knocked out of the tournament. The reason? Not him playing bad tennis. Not his opponent having an incredible day. Djokovic was disqualified without even a set being complete because he hit the ball at a line judge. The Serbian tennis star seemingly accidentally struck one of the line judges with a ball in frustration during his last-16 match against Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta. Against the unseeded Carreno Busta, Djokovic was doing what he does best in the first set: play efficient tennis without over-exerting himself and waiting to pounce on mistakes from his opponent. At 4-5, on the Spaniard’s serve, it seemed as if that moment had arrived. Djokovic had three set points and Carreno Busta was on the brink of losing the first set without having actually played all that badly. The set would have been over but for an incredible challenge. Down 0-40, Carreno Busta hit a forehand that was called out, but Hawkeye showed it was a hair’s breadth inside the baseline. Carreno Busta fought through that game to keep the set on serve. The frustrations were starting to show for Djokovic as he angrily smashed the ball into the side of the court. In the 11th game of the set, Djokovic was down 0-30 when he slipped and fell on the court while landing on his left shoulder. He slumped to the court on his knees in pain, and a trainer had to come out to attend the injury mid-game. After receiving treatment, Djokovic was striking the ball alright but 0-30 soon ended up becoming a break of serve. The Spaniard had a chance to close out the first set but as the players started to make their ways to their chairs, the moment that will be talked about for a long time unfolded.   The moment Djokovic appeared to be looking the other way when he pulled the ball from his pocket and smacked it in the direction of the official, it hitting her full toss in the throat. The official cried out and began gasping for air as she collapsed to the ground. Her struggle to breathe properly was clearly heard on the broadcast. Djokovic and officials rushed over to her to check if she was okay and placed his hand on her back as she struggled to breathe. After a few minutes she got up and walked off the court looking dazed. Around ten minutes of discussions then ensued between Djokovic and the tournament referee Soeren Friemel along side other officials, during which the top seed pleaded his case. He was heard saying “game penalty, set penalty, (there are) many options.” The umpire then declared that Carreno Busta had won by default. Djokovic shook hands with his opponent before leaving the court.   What do the rules say? Usually in a tennis match, abuse of rackets or balls or unsportsmanlike conduct result in a point penalty schedule being invoked. There are multiple sections in the official rulebook that spell out such behaviour apart from a Point Penalty Schedule. “The first code violation is a warning, the second comes with a point penalty, and the third comes with a game penalty-with the offending player subject to default at the referee’s discretion at any time should the code be violated again thereafter. However, when a situation such as Sunday’s arises in a match, the Point Penalty Schedule may be bypassed in favor of an immediate default,” the US Open tournament website stated in a report. The call to default Djokovic from the tournament was taken by US Open Referee Soeren Friemel who made it clear that the Serb had no intention to hurt but the rules made the decision unavoidable based on section T which states: Section T of Article III, “On-Site Player Offenses,” of the ITF Grand Slam rulebook: The Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors may declare a default for either a single violation of this Code or pursuant to the Point Penalty Schedule set out above (section S). In all cases of default, the decision of the Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors shall be final and unappealable. Any player who is defaulted as herein provided shall lose all ranking points earned for that event at that tournament and may be fined up to the prize money won at the tournament in addition to any or all other fines levied with respect to the offending incident.   “Based on the facts that the ball was hit angrily, recklessly; that it went straight at the line umpire’s throat; that the line umpire was clearly hurt and in pain, the decision was made that Novak had to be defaulted,” Friemel said. “The facts were discussed and explained by the chair umpire and the Grand Slam Supervisor,” Friemel said. “In this situation, it is especially important that we are 100 percent sure what exactly happened. The facts were established, and then I had to speak to Novak Djokovic, (to) give him the chance to state his point of view. “His point was that he didn’t hit the line umpire intentionally... We all agree that he didn’t do it on purpose, but the facts are still that he hit the line umpire and that the line umpire was clearly hurt.”   Djokovic's reaction Choosing not to do a press conference, Djokovic went directly to his car and left the Flushing Meadows site in New York. The 33-year-old later posted an apology on Instagram saying he was “so sorry.” “This whole situation has left me really sad and empty. I checked on the lines person and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling ok. I’m extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So unintended. So wrong. I’m not disclosing her name to respect her privacy. As for the disqualification, I need to go back within and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being. I apologize to the @usopen tournament and everyone associated for my behavior. I’m very grateful to my team and family for being my rock support, and my fans for always being there with me. Thank you and I’m so sorry.” - via Instagram / Novak Djokovic  ",sports
Stokes may miss first part of IPL,"  IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals is likely to miss its premier all-rounder Ben Stokes during the first part of the T20 event as the World Cup-winner is currently in New Zealand to be with his ailing father Ged. Stokes left for Christchurch in the middle of the Test series against Pakistan last month after his father, a former All Blacks International, was diagnosed with brain cancer. “As per quarantine rules in New Zealand, Ben has just completed his 14-day isolation period after reaching New Zealand. Now he will be meeting his father and obviously he would like to spend some quiet time with his family in this time of crisis,” a source privy to developments in the franchise told PTI. Stokes has been bought by Royals for Rs 12.5 crore. “It is only logical that if he has just completed his quarantine, he would not be available for the first part of the IPL and that is completely understandable. The franchise will not even call Ben as this is not priority at the moment. Let him spend quality family time and any discussions on his availability can happen only after that,” the source added. It is understood that the franchise will “wait” for Stokes to get back to the management and only if the cricketer confirms his availability for the second half, it will take things forward. The 29-year-old has played 67 Tests, 95 ODIs and 26 T20 Internationals. He had a major role in England’s World Cup triumph besides an epic match-winning hundred in an Ashes Test match in 2019.               ",sports
Fati youngest Spain scorer,"  Ansu Fati became the youngest goalscorer in the history of the Spanish national team on Sunday by scoring in Spain’s 4-0 win over Ukraine. Aged 17 years and 311 days, Fati scored in the 32nd minute at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, when he cut in from the left and curled into the bottom corner. It came after a spell-binding opening half an hour from the youngster, whose driving run had already earned a penalty for Sergio Ramos to convert. Ramos then headed in to make it two before Fati made history on his first start for Spain, beating the country’s previous youngest scorer, Juan Errazquin, who scored three goals aged 18 against Switzerland in 1925. Manchester City’s new signing Ferran Torres made it four late on as Spain registered their first victory in this season’s Nations League to go top of League A’s Group 4. Fati is now the youngest player to score for Spain, for Barca in La Liga and the youngest to score in the Champions League as well. In Basel, Germany’s wait for a win in the Nations League continued with a 1-1 draw against Switzerland. Germany looked in control after Ilkay Gundogan’s 14th-minute goal but slowly allowed Switzerland back into the game before Silvan Widmer leveled for the hosts. Since 2018, Germany has played six games in the first two editions of the Nations League and won none of them, despite scoring the opening goal in its last fourmatches in the competition.   ",sports
"Kohli, ABD feel this could be ‘breakthrough season’ for RCB","  Virat Kohli has been able to “disconnect” from the underwhelming seasons that he and Royal Challengers Bangalore have endured in the IPL and there is a welcome “sense of calm” as he prepares to lead the side this year, something he last felt in 2016. “The 2016 IPL, we all loved to be a part of (it). Since then, this is the most balanced I have felt about (the) squad,” the Indian skipper said on RCB’s Youtube show Bold Diaries, sharing his thoughts on the upcoming edition starting September 19. Kohli said that both he and AB de Villiers feel that this could be the “breakthrough season” when tables will turn for the franchise which has flattered to deceive on many occasions. “I (have) never felt so calm going into a season before. He (ABD) is coming from a very different space and he is enjoying his life and is very relaxed and fit as ever. I feel I am in a much better space, much more balanced, when it comes to environment of (the) IPL,” the straight speaking RCB skipper said. This is the first time he feels that he isn’t carrying any baggage. “Disconnecting with things that have happened in the past and not taking that baggage, as we have done that way too many times,” he responded to a query on what has changed for him this season. “Just because we have a bunch of players that are so skilled, people like seeing them play is the reason people have had so much expectation as well.” Kohli said adding to his confidence is the presence of South African pacer Chris Morris, Australian white-ball skipper Aaron Finch and his unknown compatriot Josh Philippe, a 23-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman. “Morris brings in a lot of balance. Aaron Finch is someone who has experience of playing international cricket for a while. Some of the youngsters we have picked this time are quite exciting too like Josh Philippe, a very exciting player,” the skipper said.  ",sports
Fati becomes youngest Spain scorer in 4-0 win over Ukraine,"  Teenager Ansu Fati became the youngest player to score for Spain in a 4-0 win against Ukraine in the Nations League. Fati on Sunday scored Spain's third goal from outside the area in the 32nd minute to become the country's youngest scorer at the age of 17 years, 311 days. The previous record was held by Juan Errazquin, who scored for Spain in 1925 at 18 years, 344 days. Fati started his strong performance by dribbling past Oleksandr Tymchyk before he was tripped by Serhiy Kryvtsov in the area. That set up Sergio Ramos to go to the penalty spot in the third minute and score his first of two goals. Spain coach Luis Enrique said he had rarely seen the level of confidence that Barcelona forward Fati has displayed with the national team since his debut on Thursday against Germany. ""It is not normal,"" Luis Enrique said. ""At his age it is very easy for the hype to get to you, but Ansu is mature enough to stay on the path that he is following. He is level-headed and with his feet on the ground."" Ramos got his second with a header in the 29th, netting his 23rd international goal to move level with Alfredo Di St fano as Spain's eighth all-time leading scorer. New Manchester City signing Ferran Torres capped the win with a goal in the 84th after coming on as a substitute. Spain leads its Nations League group with four points after Germany drew 1-1 with Switzerland. Ukraine has three points, Germany two and Switzerland one in Group 4 of League A. Luis Enrique continued to rejuvenate his side, giving debuts to Manchester City defender Eric Garc a and Real Madrid defender Sergio Reguil n. The match was played at Real Madrid's Alfredo Di St fano training ground without fans due to coronavirus health measures. Making his first start for Spain, Fati impressed from the first touch, putting the ball through Tymchyk's legs. He continued to trouble the right back and almost scored from a bicycle kick that hit a defender on the line. Then came his swerving shot from long range that went in off the post. ""The truth is that it is a point of pride to work with Luis (Enrique) and these players, who have received me with open arms,"" Fati said after the match. ""I will keep working, stay humble, and let things come my way."" Fati, born in Guinea-Bissau, was given Spanish citizenship last year. On Thursday, he became Spain's youngest debutante since ngel Zubieta in 1936. He started a move in the final seconds of the match against Germany that led to the equaliser in a 1-1 draw. It has been a stunning breakout year for the youngster, as he piled up the milestones for precocious scoring. Fati became the youngest player to score for Barcelona in the Spanish league at the age of 16 years, 304 days, on Aug. 31, 2019. Two weeks later he became the youngest player to score at Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium. On December 10, he became the youngest player to score in a Champions League match in a 2-1 win at Inter Milan.   ",sports
Bopanna-Shapovalov enter quarters,"  India veteran Rohan Bopanna and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov stunned sixth seeds Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies in a hard-fought three-setter to advance to the quarterfinals of the US Open men’s doubles event here. The unseeded Indo-Canadian pair on Saturday overcame a set deficit to beat the German duo 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a second round encounter that lasted one hour and 47 minutes. Bopanna and Shapovalov will take on Dutch-Romanian combination of Jeal-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau in the quarterfinals. Bopanna is the lone surviving Indian in the tournament after the exit of Sumit Nagal and Divij Sharan. While Sumit Nagal bowed out in the second round after losing in straight sets to world no. 3 and second seed Dominic Thiem of Austria, Sharan and his Serbian partner Nikola Cacic were knocked out in the opening round of the men’s doubles event by eighth seeds Nikola Mektic and Wesley Koolhof.

Serena wins all-US tie,"  In danger of her earliest exit at the U.S. Open since her debut 22 years ago, Serena Williams turned things around and took over against Sloane Stephens. Williams emerged from the third-round matchup between two Americans who are past champions at Flushing Meadows - she’s won six of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles at the place - with a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over 2017 titlist Stephens on Saturday. Afterward, Williams’ 3-year-old daughter, Olympia, wore a mask and waved at Mom while sitting on her father's lap in a front-row seat. On her way to the locker room, Williams waved back. “I hope,” Williams said, “that she saw her mama fighting.” Williams did it, as she so often does, with her best-in-the-game serve, hitting 12 aces at up to 122 mph as it got really dialed in midway through the second set, and an ability to re-calibrate her groundstrokes that were so awry early and so superb down the stretch. “She served a lot better,” said Stephens, now 1-6 against Williams, although they hadn't played each other since 2015. “Obviously she has one of the greatest serves in the game. It’s really difficult to read.” Williams collected 10 of the last 12 games by lifting her level, to be sure. But it helped that Stephens went from playing nearly perfectly to missing more and more. Following mistakes, Stephens would look over at her coach, Kamau Murray, or smack her right thigh with her palm so loudly that it echoed through a nearly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. “In that first set, I don’t think she made any errors, honestly. She was playing so clean. I said, ‘I don’t want to lose in straight sets,” said Williams, whose only career U.S. Open loss before the fourth round came in the third against Irina Spirlea in 1998 at age 16. Williams, who turns 39 in three weeks, said she told herself Saturday: “OK, Serena, just get a game. Get a game.” There were, of course, no fans - banned because of the coronavirus pandemic - and so the whole thing was flush with the feel of a practice session, rather than a high-stakes contest on a Grand Slam stage. There were some other players on hand to watch, including 15th-seeded Maria Sakkari, who sipped orange juice and ate lunch while on her player suite's balcony. Sakkari had a vested interest: She faces Williams for a berth in the quarterfinals. Other women into the fourth round: No. 16 Elise Mertens, No. 20 Karolina Muchova and Tsvetana Pironkova, who defeated No. 18 Donna Vekic 6-4, 6-1. In men’s action, 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev and another semifinalist from a year ago, No. 6 Matteo Berrettini moved on, as did No. 10 Andrey Rublev, No. 15 Felix Auger-Aliassime, No. 21 Alex de Minaur and Vasek Pospisil, who's been in the news lately because he teamed up with Novak Djokovic to set up a new association to represent players. Pospisil eliminated No. 8 Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and next faced another five-set winner, de Minaur, who defeated No. 11 Karen Khachanov 6-4, 0-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. Williams vs. Sakkari is a rematch of their meeting won last month by Sakkari at the            Western & Southern Open, a hard-court tournament played at the U.S. Open site instead of its usual home in Ohio because of the pandemic. ""You know, Serena is Serena,"" Sakkari said after advancing earlier Saturday by beating 19-year-old American Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 6-1. ""You have to come up with some great tennis. Otherwise there is no chance against her."" Stephens did that very thing in the early stages Saturday. She was playing patient, wait-for-the-right-moment tennis, creating lengthy, complicated points that more often than not ended with Williams blinking first. The end of the first set was met by total silence - not even the awkward, manufactured soundtrack piped in during other matches to simulate ambient noise. From 2-all in the second, Williams finally made inroads. She saved a break point, then broke for the first time when Stephens missed a forehand, part of a stretch in which Williams grabbed 12 of 15 points. She was on her way. And now she is four wins from adding to her Grand Slam trophy count, which has been at 23 since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant. Asked Saturday what the positives are about still being active on tour as a parent, Williams said: “One day, your daughter can say she was there. Whether she remembers or not, we can always have pictures. But other than that, it’s just (a) minus, like: I'm not with her, I’m not around her. It's hard.” Williams has reached the finals at four of the past seven major tournaments, losing each time. “We all hope she gets to it,” Stephens said. “If she is feeling pressure, I hope she releases it and gets to 24.”  ",sports
"BCCI finally releases IPL schedule, MI to face CSK in opener","  Ending days of anxious wait, the BCCI on Sunday released the schedule for the upcoming IPL, and in keeping with tradition, defending champions Mumbai Indians will take on runners-up Chennai Super Kings in the opener in Abu Dhabi on September 19. Moved out of India due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the upcoming edition of the world's biggest T20 league will be held in the three venues of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the UAE. After the tournament-opener in the capital city, Dubai will host its first game the next day when Delhi Capitals take on Kings XI Punjab followed by the third match on Monday between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore. The action will then shift to Sharjah on September 22 when Rajasthan Royals will host Chennai Super Kings. There will be 10 double headers, with the first match starting at 3:30pm IST and the second 7:30pm, according to a BCCI release. In all, 24 matches will be held in Dubai, 20 in Abu Dhabi and 12 in Sharjah. Venues for the playoffs and the IPL 2020 final will be announced later. The final is slated for November 10. The upcoming 53-day edition is by far the longest in the history of the league. The schedule was expected to be out in the last week of August but the announcement was delayed after 13 personnel of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp tested positive for the dreaded virus. Also, due to different quarantine rules in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, IPL's operations team took time to finalise the schedule. As per IPL rules, the defending champions and the last year's runner-up face off in the tournament opener. The same is going to happen this year after concerns over Chennai Super Kings' readiness were erased with their first practice session in Dubai on Friday. CSK were the last franchise to hit the nets after clearing final rounds of COVID-19 testing. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all other CSK players, except for the COVID-19 afflicted duo of Deepak Chahar and Ruturaj Gaikwad, started training on Friday. With Deepak and Ruturaj testing positive last week along with 11 members of the CSK contingent, the team was forced to delay its training plan after completing the six-day quarantine, including three tests, upon arrival on August 21. The virus free players had to undergo three additional tests before beginning their training on Friday. The infected players are in 14-day quarantine. This year's IPL was originally scheduled to be held from March 29 to May 24 but was postponed barely two weeks before the start of the tournament due to the coronavirus outbreak. Then, as the number of cases increased, the league was indefinitely postponed but the postponement of the T20 World Cup cleared the decks for the league to take place in the September-November window.

Mladenovic out of US Open because of coronavirus quarantine,"  The top-seeded women's doubles team was dropped from the U.S. Open because one of the players, Kristina Mladenovic of France, was issued a quarantine notice by public health officials from the county where her tournament hotel is. Mladenovic was one of seven players placed under extra restrictions during the tournament after contact tracing determined she potentially could have been exposed to COVID-19 by Benoit Paire, the only entrant to test positive. The U.S. Tennis Association announced Saturday that it was removing Mladenovic and her partner, Timea Babos of Hungary, saying it was obligated to adhere to government guidance. Mladenovic and Babos were supposed to play their second-round match against Gabriela Dabrowski of Canada and Alison Riske of the U.S., who advanced via walkover. Mladenovic had been allowed to compete until Saturday, playing two matches in singles she lost in the second round after blowing a 6-1, 5-1 lead and winning one in doubles. And the other half-dozen players found to have contact with Paire also played in the tournament, including No. 32 seed Adrian Mannarino in men's singles, whose match Friday was delayed for more than 2 hours until it was determined he could play. He lost. The USTA said the new quarantine orders arrived after Mannarino's match and meant those players identified as having prolonged close contact with the infected player will quarantine in their rooms for the remainder of their quarantine period. Mary Ellen Laurain, a spokeswoman for the Nassau County Department of Health, said medical privacy rules prevented her from discussing the cases of individual players. But she said 14-day quarantine orders are issued for any person living or staying in the county, including at hotels, who has had contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. FORZA, BERRETTINI! No fans are allowed inside the gates at the U.S. Open because of the pandemic, but 2019 semifinalist Matteo Berrettini's most loyal supporter found a way to offer encouragement Saturday by yelling from outside a fence near Court 17. After beating No. 30 seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 to return to the fourth round at Flushing Meadows, No. 6 Berrettini was asked whether he was aware of his pal's attempts to be heard. Nobody didn't hear him, said Berrettini, a 24-year-old from Rome. Was really loud today. I think louder than the other days. The fan is also Italian and owns the restaurant on Manhattan's Lower East Side where Berrettini went for dinner most nights during his lengthy stay in New York a year ago. His pal even sat in Berrettini's guest box during that run, wearing a shirt festooned with the word Carbonara. On Saturday, he was outside the fence, shouting in Italian, saying phrases that mean Let's go! or Be strong! NOT BAD, EH? Everyone's been anticipating big things from young Canadians Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is 20 and seeded 15th, and Denis Shapovalov, who's 21 and seeded 12th and they're both still around at this year's U.S. Open. What about another player from Canada, Vasek Pospisil? He's 30, ranked 94th and hadn't played an official match since February when he arrived at Flushing Meadows. To be honest, Pospisil said, I wasn't expecting a lot. Well, now Pospisil is into the fourth round for the first time in nine appearances at the U.S. Open, thanks to his upset of No. 8 Roberto Bautista Agut by a 7-5, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 score Saturday. That followed Pospisil's elimination of another seed, No. 25 Milos Raonic, who just so happens to be from Canada, too. Pospisil is dealing with an abdominal strain and a thigh strain but hanging in there. I think I'm more mature. I'm better at using my energy more (carefully), said Pospisil, who won the 2014 Wimbledon doubles title with Jack Sock. As you get older, you figure those things out better. Pospisil, who is helping Novak Djokovic start a new association for men's tennis players, can get to the second Grand Slam singles quarterfinal of his career by beating No. 21 seed Alex de Minaur of Australia next.

Un-believable,"  Borna Coric comes back from 1-5 down in the 4th set, saving six match points, to beat Tsitsipas  Croat Borna Coric saved six match points as he rallied from 5-1 down in the fourth set to stun Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4) and send the fourth seed tumbling out of US Open in the third round on Friday. In the sort of late drama that would on any other year have had the Flushing Meadows crowd baying for more, Coric staged a remarkable comeback at an empty Louis Armstrong Stadium to reach the fourth round after the fifth set tiebreak. The gritty 27th seed had looked down for the count when Tsitsipas twice served for the match in the fourth set but the 22-year-old Greek faltered with victory in his grasp. Coric again had to come from a break down in the fifth but looked indefatigable even after 4 and 1/2 hours on court and secured a famous victory on his second match point. “I just have to be honest and have to say that I was real lucky,” said Coric, who will face Australian Jordan Thompson on Sunday for a spot in his first Grand Slam quarter-final. Earlier, Alexander Zverev feared his tie with Adrian Mannarino might not go ahead due to coronavirus protocols but the German secured a 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 win in a match delayed almost three hours due to talks between the organisers and New York health officials. The third-round clash was originally scheduled to start at 2.30pm local time at Louis Armstrong Stadium but was pushed back while the United States Tennis Association engaged in “collaborative dialogue” with health officials. “I was told there is very little chance that we were going to play,” Zverev said courtside after the match. “The New York State called and said he (Mannarino) shouldn’t play. “So it was back and forth, back and forth... it was political, not about us players.” Zverev next faces Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who defeated Britain’s Cameron Norrie 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-2, 6-1. Top seed Novak Djokovic continued his dominance of Jan-Lennard Struff with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win to advance to the fourth round. The three-time champion at Flushing Meadows and 17-time Grand Slam winner was never really pushed by the German, who has taken just one set off the Serb in their five career meetings. The only drama came early on when Struff had break-point opportunities but could not convert against Djokovic’s serve in the first game.  ",sports
Osaka survives scare,"  Two-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka battled into the last 16 of the US Open on Friday, requiring three sets to defeat 18-year-old Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk. Osaka, the 2018 US Open champion, needed 2 hours and 33 minutes to beat the unseeded world No 137 6-3, 6-7 (4/7), 6-2 inside an empty Arthur Ashe Stadium. “She was very good. I’m kind of scared of how she is going to be in the future,” Osaka said of her vanquished opponent. Frustration got the better of the Japanese fourth seed in the second set. After recovering from 5-3 to force a tie-break she threw her racquet when Kostyuk tied the match 1-1. But Osaka’s experience came through in the deciding set as she held her serve and broke Kostyuk twice to set up a match against 14th seed Anett Kontaveit. Kontaveit progressed by beating 24th seed Magda Linetter 6-3, 6-2. Osaka, of Haitian and Japanese heritage, walked onto the court wearing a facemask emblazoned with the name of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man who was shot dead in broad daylight while jogging in the town of Brunswick, in southern Georgia, in February. Osaka is wearing different masks honoring victims of racial injustice and police brutality throughout the tournament. Germany’s 17th seed Angelique Kerber also progressed to the fourth round, making light work of American Ann Li 6-3, 6-4. Kerber, the 2016 US Open, will go up against Jennifer Brady for a quarter-final spot after the American 28th seed knocked out Caroline Garcia 6-3, 6-3. Petra Kvitova struggled with unforced errors but still had enough weapons to defeat American Jessica Pegula 6-4, 6-3 to advance to the fourth round. The two-time Wimbledon champion had 28 unforced errors and five double faults but moved up a gear when it mattered to win her first career meeting with baseline battler Pegula. Next up for her will be another American in Shelby Rogers, who earlier advanced with a 6-2, 6-4 win against compatriot Madison Brengle. In other games, eighth seed Petra Martic swept aside unseeded Varvara Gracheva 6-3, 6-3. Martic will play Yulia Putintseva in the last 16 after the 23rd seed powered past Vera Lapko 6-3, 6-3.

Hamilton sets speed record to take Monza pole,"  Lewis Hamilton claimed pole position with a new lap record at Monza for Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix with Valtteri Bottas taking second in Saturday qualifying for another Mercedes front row lock-out. McLaren’s Carlos Sainz posted the third fastest time and is joined on the second row by Sergio Perez for Racing Point. The session proved another humbling experience for out-of-sorts Ferrari with Sebastian Vettel going out in Q1 and Charles Leclerc, who won at the circuit last year, in Q2. This means no Ferrari inside the top 10 at Monza for the first time since 1984. The championship leader and six-time champion clocked a fastest lap in one minute and 18.887 seconds to beat the Finn by 0.069 seconds. In pure speed, Hamilton’s track lap record performance produced an unconfirmed fastest lap in F1 history. It was Hamilton’s record-increasing 94th career pole position, his sixth in seven races and his seventh in Italy. “It wasn’t too bad,” said Hamilton, with a hint of a smile. “It was a fantastic performance from the team — in terms of timing, when they put us out on the track,” said Hamilton. Max Verstappen was fifth for Red Bull, Lando Norris qualified sixth in the second McLaren ahead of Daniel Ricciardo of Renault, Lance Stroll in the second Racing Point, Alex Albon in the second Red Bull and Pierre Gasly of Alpha Tauri. Bottas also broke the track record twice and said: “It was really close as I expected. I am not sure about the tow — I didn’t have any until the end and I kind of felt the benefit, but then on the final lap I was on my own again. “It was a good place to be, but obviously we didn’t get any gains in a straight line.”  ",sports
Younger guys will feel little less pressure in empty stadium: Katich,"  Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) head coach Simon Katich feels that while younger guys will feel lesser pressure in empty stadiums but it could well be a challenge for the senior cricketers as they gear up for Indian Premier League. “Personally, I think some of the younger players actually enjoy the fact that there will be a little less pressure with less people at the ground, creating all that noise and distraction,” Katich said during RCB’s YouTube show Bold Diaries. “I think it will be more of a challenge for some of the older guys that are used to the buzz of the crowd and getting their adrenaline going. But I think there will still be a lot of motivation within our squad to go out and perform well,” he added. Experienced mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton had earlier said that cricketers like Virat Kohli who depend on external stimulation and are used to ‘pressure’ are “really going to struggle” in front of empty stadium but self-motivated players will “do a hell lot better” in this year’s IPL. Royal Challengers Bangalore led by Kohli completed their mandatory quarantine upon their arrival in Dubai and had started their training camps last week. Katich said younger players could make an impact in this year’s tournament. “I think the players will be motivated enough as there is a lot at stake in terms of the opportunity that it presents and the players want to make the most of that. They know this is a big tournament,” said the former Australia cricketer.  ",sports
"If Narine gets grip from surface, he will be effective: Gambhir","  Sunil Narine’s former IPL captain Gautam Gambhir believes that the mystery spinner will be very effective for KKR provided if he gets a “bit of grip from the UAE surfaces” during the Indian Premier League. “If Sunil Narine gets a little grip from the UAE wickets, he will be very effective,” Gambhir said on Star Sports show Cricket Connected about his former KKR teammate, who has been instrumental in their two title triumphs. “For me, the most important thing is that when Sunil Narine is hiding the ball during his run-up, it will increase the difficulties for the batsmen. It will be difficult to find which ball will go away and which ball will come in. “Because the later you see the ball in the hand, the more difficult it is for the batsmen.” Gambhir feels if Narine bowls at quicker pace he will be way more effective. “Rashid Khan is so successful because of his pace and Sunil Narine has been successful when he has bowled quicker, it is a new thing we have seen and this might make him very successful in the IPL,” the former India batsman said.

‘Incredibly consistent’ Malan delivers every single time in T20s: Nasser,"  Former England skipper Nasser Hussain has praised top-order batsman Dawid Malan for his “incredible” consistency in T20 cricket, saying the left-hander delivers every time he comes out to bat. The 33-year-old Malan, who made his debut in the shortest format of the game in 2017, has notched up a ton and seven fifties in the 14 T20Is he has featured in. Malan has been in red-hot form in T20 cricket. After playing out an unbeaten 54-run innings against Pakistan last week, he was adjudged the man of the match for his 43-ball 66 against Australia which helped England win the first T20 by 2 runs on Friday. “Every single time, he delivers. T20 is not that easy to be consistent because at times you have to go in and give it a bit of a smack, he has been incredibly consistent,” Hussain told Sky Sports. “What I like about him is that he doesn’t overhit. He’s got long levers, but you never really see Dawid Malan slogging, he’s in real control of all those shots,” he added. The 52-year-old also feels England currently have a very strong limited-overs side with several quality players going up against each other to get into the team.  ",sports
Ian Bell announces retirement,"  Realising that his days as an England player are long gone, former stylish batsman Ian Bell on Saturday announced he will retire from all forms of cricket at the end of the 2020 domestic season. The five-time Ashes winner has spent his entire career with Warwickshire. Bell has scored 7727 runs, including 22 hundreds, at an average of 42.69 in 118 Test matches while in the ODIs, he has 5,416 runs in 161 matches. “It’s with enormous sadness, but with equal pride, that I am announcing my retirement from professional cricket,” Bell said in a statement. The stylish Bell, known for his exquisite cover drives, was Man of the Series in one of the five Ashes triumphs and was also part of England’s memorable Test series triumph on Indian soil in 2012. “While my hunger and enthusiasm for the sport that I love remain as strong as ever, my body simply can’t keep up with the demands of the game to the standard of which I expect of myself,” Bell added. Bell, 38, retired from ODIs in 2015 to focus on Test cricket, but ironically, played his last five-day game for England the same year. Bell has never played a Test match since November 2015, failing to add to his 118 caps. “It’s true when they say you know when the time’s right, and unfortunately, my time is now,” the 38-year-old said.

Mustafizur denied NOC to play in IPL 13,"  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has refused to give No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to pacer Mustafizur Rahman after he was approached by IPL franchises, in view of the national side’s scheduled tour of Sri Lanka beginning next month, according to reports. The left-arm pacer was approached by Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders for the upcoming season in the UAE, both of whom had one of their pacers withdrawn from the squad, a report in cricbuzz.com said. While Mumbai Indians replaced Lasith Malinga with James Pattinson, KKR are yet to find a replacement for Harry Gurney. However, BCB refused the NOC since Bangladesh are set to tour Sri Lanka for a three-match Test series scheduled to start on October 24, at a time when IPL will be played in the UAE. “Yes, he (Mustafizur) had an offer from the IPL but we did not give him NOC as we have the Sri Lanka tour coming up,” BCB cricket operation chairman Akram Khan was quoted as saying by cricbuzz. The 24-year-old Rahman, however, has not been in Bangladesh’s Test plans since March 2019. He took 20 wickets in the 2019 World Cup, after which he has only played ODIs and T20Is for Bangladesh. In 13 Tests since 2015, Rahman has picked 28 wickets. He last played in the IPL in 2018, turning out for Mumbai Indians. In seven matches that season, he took seven wickets at an average of 32.85 and an economy rate of 8.36. He had returned from his stint in 2018 IPL with an injury, after which BCB president Nazmul Hassan had said he won’t be allowed any more NOCs to participate in overseas leagues. The BCB had allowed Rahman to register for the IPL auction last year but he went unsold. The BCB is planning a week-long residential camp later this month ahead of the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. Rahman is expected to be a part of the camp.  ",sports
Australia keen to help Stoinis evolve as finisher like Dhoni,"  Australia is willing to give recalled all-rounder Marcus Stoinis a longer run to help him evolve as a finisher in the mould of former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, said vice-captain Pat Cummins. Stoinis’ unbeaten 23 off 18 balls was not enough as Australia slipped from 124-2 to 148-6 to lose the opening T20I against England. Australia have a lot of quality players who bat in the top-order for their domestic T20 sides but the world number one team is still searching for a batsman in the middle-order who can finish off games. Opening the batting, 31-year old Stoinis scored 705 runs for Melbourne Stars to top the BBL runs chart last season. However, his inability to rotate the strike early in the innings has been one of the reasons why he was left out of the 2019 World Cup. “It’s something we’ve spoken about for exactly that reason — they’re all the best players when they go back to playing domestic comps,” Cummins was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald. “You could argue that middle-order role is one of the hardest in any cricket team. That’s what we’ve identified, we’ve got to give guys a go. “Someone like MS Dhoni, he was one of the best in the world because he played 300-400 ODI games. You saw during this week’s practice games we gave a lot of guys a go in that.” Cummins said Australia has identified the roles and wants to give the players enough game time to cement their places. “We know it’s not going to happen overnight. That’s been a common theme that selectors and Finchy (Aaron Finch) have spoken about: we’ll identify roles and give them a long run in that. “I think we’ve got the right squad, the right players, it’s about getting plenty of games into everyone now,” the pace spearhead said.

Ramky to spend Rs 150 crore on waste to energy plant if authorities approve,"  For the proper disposal of refuse derived fuel (RDF) generated in the solid waste management and recycling plant at Sheeshambada in Dehradun, Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited (REEL) that manages the operation of the plant, is ready to spend about Rs 150 crore to set up waste to energy power plant in Dehradun. About 100 metric tonnes of RDF is generated daily in the plant but the management has been unable to dispose of it completely so far. In the past, the locals living nearby the plant have also alleged that tonnes of RDF were buried by the administration of the plant, though the management has repeatedly refuted the allegations. However, the company has asserted that it is planning to set up a six megawatt waste to energy plant in Dehradun for which it has already submitted a proposal to Uttarakhand Government and expressed its willingness to spend about Rs 150 crore. According to the management of REEL, the head of the Waste to Energy division of the company had a meeting with the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in January explaining how setting up a waste to energy power plant facility in Dehradun can be a permanent and sustainable solution for the disposal of RDF generated from the waste collected from the city. As per the management, the company is well equipped to begin the construction of the power plant but is awaiting the approval of the State government and the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD). Meanwhile, on the question of why it is taking so long for REEL to get No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB), the management said that it got delayed due to ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdown that commenced from March. They claimed that they had submitted the renewal application online to UEPPCB and a site inspection has also been conducted by the board. The management is in touch with the board and is optimistic about getting the renewal certificate of Consent to Operate (CTO) from the pollution control board in the next few days.  ",state-editions

Two held for supplying weapons in G’gram,"  The Gurugram Police have arrested two men for allegedly supplying illegal weapons in the city on Wednesday, the police said. The arrested accused were identified as 32-year-old Kuldeep Singh alias Kullu of Bhiwani district in Haryana and 22-year-old Sachin alias Kalu, a resident of Uttar Pradesh. Kuldeep Singh is stated to be the mastermind. ""Based on specific inputs, the duo were arrested from Sehrawan ki Dhani near Manesar on Wednesday evening, after a brief exchange of fire with the police party. The police have recovered 11 automatic pistols with 7 live cartridges and a Toyota Corolla car from the accused,"" said Preet Pal Sangwan, ACP (crime). The weapons were reportedly brought to Gurugram in order to be supplied to criminals operating in the city. The police have also identified the criminals to whom the accused duo have handed the consignment, but didn't disclose the names for investigation reasons.

"Ranchi MLA lauds farm Bills, highlights features","  Senior BJP leader and former minister, CP Singh on Thursday attacked UPA parties including Congress for opposing the agriculture reform bills passed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi government. Singh, addressing a press conference at party office said, “Congress opposition to the agriculture reform Bill has exposed the grand old party. Entire nation has seen the double stands of Congress.” Singh said, “The Congress party has talked about agricultural reforms in its manifesto, but today they are opposing it. In 2013, Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress will exclude fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act in the governed states, but today they are opposing this change.” Targeting Congress party, Singh the 6th time Ranchi MLA, said that the Congress party did nothing to empower the farmers in the last 55 years. Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ranchi MLA said that the PM has done historic work for the development and progress of agriculture and farmers. In the UPA government the agriculture budget was Rs 12,000 crores which was increased to Rs 1.34 lakh crores. Singh claimed that Rs 92,000 crores have been transferred in farmers’ account in Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. Highlighting some of the agriculture schemes launched by the Modi government, Singh said that under Prime Minister Kisan Maandhan scheme, provision of pension of Rs 3000 per month for 60 years of farmers has been made. The farmers have received double the minimum support price (MSP) in 7 years. Highlighting the MSP increase under NDA regime, Singh said during UPA regime the MSP on lentils was Rs 2950 per quintal which has been increased to Rs 5100 per quintal. The MSP of Urad dal has increased from Rs 4300 to Rs 6000; similarly the MSP of moong, arhar, gram, mustard has been increased drastically. The increase in lentils MSP has yielded procurement of pulses where 1.25 lakh metric tons of pulses were purchased between 2009-14 it has increased to76.85 lakh metric tons of pulses between 2014-19. Describing the Agricultural Reforms Bill as beneficial for the farmers, Singh said that the confusion being spread by the opponents is absolutely baseless and wrong. Farmers will continue to get the minimum support price, now with the One Nation, One Market policy, the farmer will now be able to sell his crop to anyone anywhere, the agreement will guarantee the farmers to get the fixed price. On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha passed two contentious key farm bills - Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020) through voice vote despite ruckus created by Opposition members.

JMM blames Raghubar for teachers' agony,"  The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Thursday said that the Jharkhandi candidates and their families have faced problems at present due to the irrational and wrong employment policy of the former Bharatiya Janata Party Government led by former Chief Minister Raghubar Das. People should take legal action against former Chief Minister because as the head of the then Council of Ministers, Das is fully responsible for this policy. On the High Court's decision on employment policy, JMM General Secretary cum Spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said that the Government had the right to make laws for tribal and indigenous people in special circumstances on the advice of TSC in the Government of India vs Rakesh Kumar case. But, the Raghubar Government did not implement it. The then Government used only Para 5 of Article 5, due to which this planning policy could not stand in the Court. Targeting BJP legislative body leader Babulal Marandi, Bhattacharya said that it was for his vested interest that he sent six of his MLAs for the majority of the Raghubar Government. “The six JVM MLAs not only strengthened the Raghubar Government, but their own MLA Amar Bauri deceived the people of Jharkhand in the name of employment policy. The 1985 cut-off date and employment policy is completely irrational and unconstitutional,” he added. Bhattacharya said that the employment policy issued by the Raghubar Government in July 2016 in the name of employment and teachers’ recruitment was a completely fraudulent document. “On the recommendation of the committee headed by the then Minister Amar Bauri, an employment policy was announced under Article 309 under Para 5 of Schedule 5 of the Constitution. Under this, 13 districts of the State were kept under notified area and 11 districts under un notified area,” he added. The JMM leader said that the party had doubts about the manner, in which the Jharkhandi candidates were troubled by the High Court's decision on Monday. Due to the wrong policies of the Raghubar Government, thousands of candidates have lost their jobs however, this is not the first time, he added.  “At present the Raghubar Government is also responsible for the agitating Assistant Policemen. The Raghubar Government claimed to have given 75000 jobs in the last five years and it was included in the Guinness Book of Records. Employment fair was organized for this; agencies were invited on the expense of Government money. At that time also JMM said that it is fraud and the Government is doing so to dupe people,” said Bhattacharya. The party Spokesperson said that the then Government also misguided the Governor before doing so.” JMM has been saying from the beginning that the 1985 cut-off date in the local policy and the employment policy of the Raghubar Government is completely irrational and unconstitutional. This policy was introduced to cheat and fool people but the BJP, which has pat its back in the name of employment, only fools the people of the State,” he added.  ",state-editions
PNS,"  Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Central Government, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) on Thursday said that the Government wants to end agricultural mandis across the Country to benefit its businessmen friends and also trying by abolishing Minimum Support Price (MSP) to save Rs one lakh crore. Addressing a virtual press rally JPCC In Charge, RPN Singh said that the three bills related to agriculture got passed by the Central Government by violating the parliamentary tradition, will eliminate 40 lakh mandis of the country, which will cause a lot of loss to the poor farmers, because 86 per cent farmers have less than five acres of land and 60 per cent farmers do agricultural work on less than 2 acres of land in the Country. “In such a situation, by abolishing the necessity of MSP in the new law, the farmers will be forced to bow before the corporate house. The BJP wants to implement the recommendation of the Shanta Kumar Committee's report, which states that the abolition of MSP can save Rs One lakh crore to the Central Government, the BJP-led Government is working on this agenda,” said Singh The party State In-Charge said that even though the Prime Minister has been repeatedly saying that the MSP will not be abolished, why the Government is not making provision in the law regarding it. Their intent is clear, he added. Singh recalled the Prime Minister's assurances which he had given in the past and said that Modi had also said earlier that everyone would get Rs 15 lakh, two crore youth would get jobs in a year, but it proved only a jumla. He said that the BJP is also trying to spread the illusion that the Congress party had decided to take a similar step, it is completely baseless, the Congress party has only taken up the problems of the far-flung farmers and necessary initiative in the direction was assured. Announcing the future plan of the party Singh said that against the decision of the Central Government, the party has decided to run a nationwide campaign till November.  “Under this, all the leaders and workers of the party will raise the voice of farmers through social media under the Speech Up for Famers on September 26. On March 28, after the dharna in front of the statue of Gandhiji at the State headquarters, the Raj Bhavan march will be organised and a memorandum will be submitted to the President through the Governor. On October 2, on the occasion of Gandhi and Shastri birth anniversary, senior party leaders will go to the districts to participate in the protest rally.

Rising dengue cases amid Covid in Haryana posing serious challenge to Health Deptt: DG Health Services,"  With increase in the number of dengue cases being reported amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Haryana is facing a tough challenge. Even as the State has around 20,000 active cases of Covid-19, dengue cases too have steadily increased from Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Bhiwani and other parts of the State. Both Covid-19 and dengue have symptoms such as high fever, headache and body pain. Till September 12, a total of 33 confirmed dengue cases were reported in the State but the number of such cases increased to 68 till September 24. Talking to ‘The Pioneer’ over the phone,  Haryana Director General of Health Services Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj said that so far, no co-infection of dengue and Covid-19 cases has been reported from any part of the State. The Dengue test is being done free of cost in government laboratories and in all 27 Dengue Testing Labs are presently functional. In addition, dengue sampling has also started at Flu corners for suspected Dengue cases in district Bhiwani and Rohtak as mostly cases are reported from these districts. He further said that most cases of Covid-19 and dengue are asymptomatic (about 80 per cent), and in a setting of co-infection one disease might enhance the severity of the other.  “As Doctors often find it difficult to differentiate between the two diseases,  we have formed a set of protocols to help them. A new protocol has been developed to help medical professionals distinguish between Covid-19 and dengue, as both have similar symptoms. The protocols will also assist doctors to treat patients diagnosed with both the diseases effectively,"" he added.. When contacted, Dr Usha Gupta, director, Haryana Health services said that about 1,158 Dengue tests have been conducted in the State by the first week of September, 2020 apart from identifying dedicated beds for Dengue patients. Mosquito proofing of wards and beds is being done in Civil Hospitals. So far, 68 dengue cases have been reported from different parts of the State, which include 29 from Faridabad and 14 from Bhiwani. “Instructions have been issued to the authorities concerned in Gurugram, Bhiwani and others to ensure dengue cases do not increase in their districts. Moreover, Senior Health officers have been monitoring the prevalence Dengue effectively. To prevent mortality due to Dengue, new initiative i.e. the provision of free Single Donor Platelets (SDP) has been made for dengue patients admitted in Government Hospitals as some dengue patients with severe thrombocytopenia requires SDP for immediate recovery,” she added. Gupta further said that disease incidence is monitored on a daily basis and a vigil has been kept on the trend of dengue and other vector borne diseases. The Dengue situation is well under control in the State despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation.  She said, “We appeal to the general public to take up house-hold level activities to prevent mosquito breeding. For example, every Sunday should be considered as Drying Day i.e. emptying of water containers and check other probable mosquito breeding sites like cooler, overhead tanks, drum, discarded utensils, cups, bottles, tyres, pots, fridge tray etc., wear full sleeve clothes and use of mosquito repellents should be done.” Meanwhile, rising cases of dengue amid Covid-19 in Gurugram is posing a challenge to the district Health Department. The contagion of Covid-19 continued to report the highest number of 18,814 Covid-19 cases and second highest, 167 casualties in Gurugram district where maximum 29 out of 68 dengue cases have been reported. When contacted, Gurugram district health officers agreed that dengue was a challenge, especially when they were fighting Covid-19. “We held a meeting with all stakeholders to discuss steps to check dengue. Apart from municipal corporation teams that are also working on checking dengue, we have also constituted teams comprising two members each that have an assistant malaria officer (AMO). They have started visiting each sub-division for checking. Apart from that, we have divided the city into two parts and have deputed male supervisors and multi-purpose health workers, who will monitor the high risk areas,” an official said. He further said that the multi-purpose health workers and breeding checkers have been deputed to survey high risk areas from where cases are coming. They will search for the source of infection and work on source reduction. “Officials will check breeding of mosquitoes by using larvicides. They have also started checking coolers and would ensure that water is not accumulated in the city,” he said. A senior Government Health officer said that most people with dengue and Covid-19 could have mild illness and can recover at home; symptoms usually last a few days, and people tend to feel better after a week. However, both dengue and Covid-19 can cause severe illness that can result in death. The clinical management for people who develop severe illness with either of these two diseases is quite different, often requiring hospital-based care. Anyone of any age can develop severe illness with dengue or Covid-19. Both infections are more likely to cause complications in adults with underlying chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.  He further said, “Both the viral diseases do not have any specific antiviral drug or vaccine and therefore treatment depends on clinical conditions and symptoms. Both Covid-19 and dengue have unpredictable clinical courses and both generally require hospital monitoring for management. Most hospitals are busy managing Covid-19 and very little window is open for tackling another disease outbreak. Besides diagnostic and treatment challenges there is “limited experience” in tackling such situations and the “paucity of medical literature on management of such co-infection cases has kept everyone in dark.”  ",state-editions
Corporate houses will exploit contract farming: Minister,"  Accusing the Prime Minister of telling lies, Chhattisgarh Agriculture Minister Ravindra Choubey on Thursday said that the new farm bills passed by Parliament will help corporates to exploit corporate farming. There is no mention of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in the bill and now corporates can open private mandis, he told the media, adding that restrictions have been lifted on the essential commodities. These are the reasons for opposing the bills, he said. Recalling the role of successive Prime Ministers in building the agriculture sector, he said India could feed its own population after subsidy was brought in to support farmers. He said that considering the state of courts now,      farmers will be unable to fight for payments legally as cases will take years to conclude. Choubey pointed out that the bills will promote black marketing and there will be no control mechanism to control the price for consumers. The BJP government will break the backbone of the country through these bills. He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of telling lies. Chhattisgarh farmers are already exporting tomato to Pakistan and Bangladesh and rice to Gulf countries. Last year the paddy production was 1.25 lakh tonnes which in the current Kharif season will reach 1.50 lakh tonnes. With the opening up of the market, paddy from neighbouring states of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and others will flood Chhattisgarh. This will have a direct impact on local farmers, he said, leading to economic slavery.    ",state-editions
Capt appeals to all parties in Punjab to fight unitedly against farm bills,"  Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday appealed to all political parties to rise above petty considerations and come on one platform to fight unitedly against the “treacherous” Agriculture Bills that would destroy the farmers of Punjab. Asserting his commitment to protect the rights of the farmers at all costs, the Chief Minister said that he was ready to lead the political fight against the unconstitutional anti-farmer Bills with all his might. “I will do what it takes to save my farmers and my State from these dangerous new laws, whose implementation will cripple the farming sector and also destroy Punjab’s lifeline of Agriculture,” he added. “The Congress has always stood with the farmers and will fight with them, shoulder to shoulder, to scuttle the Centre’s plans to ruin not just their own families and the labourers, who toil on the fields day and night to feed the nation, but the entire state of Punjab,” said the Chief Minister. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Union Government has stooped to a new low by bringing these Bills, and that too in a totally undemocratic and unparliamentary manner, said Capt Amarinder, adding that his Government, supported by the Punjab Congress, will oppose the legislations tooth and nail in the interest of not just the farmers and the State but the entire country. Lambasting the Akalis for trying to change the narrative through their concerted and deliberate efforts to transform the ‘Punjab V/s Centre’ fight into a local political clash for their vested interests, the Chief Minister said that they have changed the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) history, reducing it from a political force into the BJP’s puppet. Capt Amarinder dismissed SAD leader Harsimat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Union Cabinet as a mockery of the Akali history of sacrifices, before the Badals hijacked the party and converted it into their personal fiefdom for their own gains. “Is giving up a berth in the Union Cabinet a sacrifice? The Badals clearly do not know the meaning of sacrifice,” he quipped, ridiculing SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s latest statement that Akali Dal can make any sacrifice for farmers. What are you still doing in the anti-farmer NDA government at the Centre, he asked the Akali leader. Sukhbir’s assertion that SAD will not let any corporate enter Punjab if the people make an Akali Dal Government in the State clearly showed that it was all about power, and the entire drama was being enacted by their party to get into the saddle, said the Chief Minister. Terming SAD’s purported U-turn on the Bills as a desperate step taken under political compulsion, when faced with the threat of total eradication from Punjab’s political arena, he pointed out that neither Sukhbir nor his wife Harsimrat even once opposed the Farm Ordinances at any point till they were presented in the Lok Sabha. “In fact, the duo continued to actively defend the Ordinances as being supportive of the farmers,” said Capt Amarinder, pointing to Sukhbir’s stand at the all-party meeting and his decision to stay away from the State Assembly session at which the resolution opposing the Bills was passed. All their claims now of being with the farmers in this fight against the Bills are a complete farce, which even the agitating farmers are taking with a pinch of salt, the Chief Minister said. MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER, ADHERE TO COVID NORMS DURING BHARAT BANDH: CAPT APPEALS TO FARMERS Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday appealed to the farmers to strictly maintain law and order, and adhere to all COVID safety protocols, during Friday’s bandh against the Agriculture Bills. “While the State Government is fully with the farmers in their fight against the Bills, and no FIRs will be registered for violation of Section 144, there should be no disturbance of the law and order during the bandh,” the Chief Minister said. He appealed to the farmers to ensure that the citizens of Punjab are not put to any inconvenience during the protest bandh, especially given the COVID crisis in the State. The Chief Minister also urged the farmers, and other organizations supporting the bandh, to maintain social distancing and wear masks at all times. The State was already in the midst of a surge in COVID-19 cases, and any violation of precautionary norms could lead to the situation spiraling out of control, he warned. He exhorted the farmers to take full care that the lives and property of the people of Punjab are not, in any way, endangered due to their agitation.  ",state-editions
Don’t deny admission to students in Govt schools under any situation: Punjab Govt to schools,"  The Punjab Government on Thursday issued instructions to the authorities not to deny admission to the students in Government schools under any situation. Notably, the enrollment in government schools has, till date, increased by 15.61 percent (3,44,986 students) and this is the highest increase in a single year till date. “Some complaints have received from the parents that their wards have been denied admission in pretext of high enrollment and lack of infrastructure,” said a spokesperson of the Punjab School Education Department. In this context the state School Education secretary Krishan Kumar directed all the District Education Officers (DEOs), secondary and elementary, of the State to give admission to the aspirants in the government schools in any case. He also directed to make appropriate arrangements at the local level in the matter of lack of infrastructure. Schools have also been asked to send proposals to start double shifts where the strength of students is very high. Earlier, the Education Department had also directed the school heads not to force the students for transfer certificates in connection with their admission in government schools and asked the school heads to admit such students at their own level. At the same time, the school principals have been directed to get a written request from the parents of the students who do not have the transfer certificate.  ",state-editions
Farmers begin 3-day Rail Roko agitation in Punjab; total bandh today,"  The farmers’ struggle against the Centre’s three agriculture bills began on Thursday with a three-day ‘Rail Roko’ campaign. Besides, the representatives of various farmers’ organizations and protestors have planned to block the roads and railway tracks at 125 places across Punjab on Friday, while making it clear that the protests would be “peaceful”. In a first of its kind development, a total of 31 farmers’ organizations of Punjab have come under one umbrella to protest against the new farm laws, announcing ‘Punjab Bandh’ on September 25. The farmers’ protest has received unprecedented response from all sections of the society, including the political parties except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which have announced to extend their support and participate in the bandh. “As per information from across the state, the call for bandh has received positive response from various unions of truckers, buses, tempos, employees, youngsters, students, labourers, and others,” said Darshan Pal, a representative of all farm unions. He added that as per their initial estimates, rail tracks and roads would be blocked at around 125 locations across various districts of Punjab. “We request all to block roads and rail tracks peacefully and do not respond to any call for violence as miscreants might try to create problems during bandh. The locations of bandh could be increased as per the demands of members of various organizations,” he added. As the farmers began their three-day rail roko agitation on Thursday, the Railways suspended several trains to avoid any untoward incident. The call for ‘rail roko’ was given by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and later different farmers’ outfits extended their support to it. Activists of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) squatted on rail tracks in Barnala and Sangrur on Thursday morning. Farmers, under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, have decided to squat on rail tracks near Devidaspur village in Amritsar and Basti Tanka wala in Ferozepur. The Railways official said: “14 pairs of special trains will remain suspended from September 24 till 26. The decision has been taken keeping in mind the safety of passengers and protection of railway property from any damage.” Among the trains that will remain suspended are the Golden Temple Mail (Amritsar-Mumbai Central), Jan Shatabdi Express (Haridwar-Amritsar), New Delhi-Jammu Tawi, Karambhoomi (Amritsar-New Jalpaiguri), Sachkhand Express (Nanded-Amritsar) and Shaheed Express (Amritsar-Jaynagar), officials said. Many freight and parcel trains have also been rescheduled. Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee president Satnam Singh Pannu said that they have appealed to representatives of political parties, Ministers, MPs and MLAs not to take part in the farmers’ agitation. “We are getting support from several sections, including government employees and labourers,” he added. The farmers decided to gherao BJP leaders and socially boycott those who voted in favour of the farm Bills. At the same time, the farmer leaders have appealed to the rural medical practitioners to be ready for supporting the farmers in case of medical emergencies as a large number of women are taking part in the protests. “The protest will be further intensified on September 26 as farmers will block rail tracks in Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Pathankot, Fazilka, Kapurthala and Jalandhar districts too,” said the committee’s state general secretary, Sarwan Singh Pandher. The Railways has decided to cancel 28 trains from Amritsar and Ferozepur stations from 6 am on Thursday in view of the safety of passengers.  The trains have been partially cancelled and short terminated till September 26 as protesters blocked rail tracks at various places, including Amritsar, Ferozepur, Sangrur, Barnala, Mansa and Nabha, said the Railways official. Among the trains that will remain suspended are the Golden Temple Mail (Amritsar-Mumbai Central), Jan Shatabdi Express (Haridwar-Amritsar), New Delhi-Jammu Tawi, Karambhoomi (Amritsar-New Jalpaiguri), Sachkhand Express (Nanded-Amritsar) and Shaheed Express (Amritsar-Jaynagar), the officials said. SUPPORT POURS IN Punjab’s 14 former IAS officers have also joined hands to appeal to the Central Government to take immediate initiative and resolve the present crisis in consultation with State Governments and representatives of other stakeholders including agitating farmers. The former babus maintained that there was no urgency to issue these ordinances when the country was fighting Corona epidemic, and added, “It seems government deliberately chose the timing so that the opposition to these measures is minimal due to fear of Corona…law or instructions issued to combat corona would be helpful in dealing with agitation against these ordinances. In spite of Government calculations, lakhs of farmers and their supporters are on the roads flouting social distancing norms. This may lead to catastrophic situation”. Maintaining that these bills impinge upon the rights of the States as well their finances, the former IAS officers said: “We have also noted with grave anguish and concern the manner in which two bills were passed in Rajya Sabha by ‘voice vote’ when several members were demanding ‘division’ (Voting). This does not augur well for our democratic functioning.” “Mere reading of the ordinances or bills would reveal that these measures would help the Corporate sector to expand in agriculture. The farmers are agitating against these bills. Most of their concerns and fears are genuine and well founded. We support their demands,” submitted a group of retired IAS officers including Dr Manmohan Singh, Dr. Harkesh Singh Sidhu, Kulbir Singh Sidhu, Gurnihal Singh Peerzada, Gurdev Singh Sidhu, Surinderjit Singh Sandhu, Sukhjit Singh Bains, Manjit Singh Narang, Prithi Chand, Capt. Narinder Singh, Tejinder Singh Dhaliwal, Sukhjit Singh Bains, Raminder Singh, Ujagar Singh. Punjab Youth Congress, which on Thursday organized statewide ‘8 Vaje 8 Minute Mashal March’ in support of the Punjab bandh call of farmers, has also decided to support the agitation. “The PYC members will perform duties during dharnas be it serving water, food or other things needed at the spot,” said PYC president Brinder Singh Dhillon. Sikhs’ mini parliament Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), radical Sikh organization Dal Khalsa and seminary Damdami Taksal have also extended their support to the farmers’ bandh call on September 25. Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh said, “The people of Punjab, including the political parties, should join hands for the cause. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) should snap its ties with the BJP to show solidarity with farmers.”  ",state-editions
Punjab launches Statewide ‘Digital Parent Margdarshak Program’,"  To build up the learning ability of anganwari-going toddlers stuck at home and guiding their parents during these unprecedented times of COVID-19 pandemic, Punjab Social Security, Women and Child Development Minister Aruna Chaudhary on Thursday formally launched ‘Digital Parent Margdarshak Program’. Chaudhary sent the first activity message to the Principal Secretary Raji P Shrivastava, who further forwarded the same to margdarshaks-Anganwadi workers to cover each and all children of the Anganwadi Centres. The Minister said that the State Govt is working tirelessly to impart education through distance learning to the students of all classes during this perilous time.“In order to help tiny-tots of anganwari centres, the mode of distance learning is being implemented in the Social Security, Women and Child Development Dept,” she said, adding that the Department, in collaboration with the Meraki Foundation, has developed the ‘Digital Parent Margdarshak Program’ as the COVID situation has brought about in-person dis-engagement resulting in more reliance on distance learning. She said that margdarshaks and functionaries of this specialized program, which will be implemented in two phases and each phase will cover 11 districts, have been given fortnight training to make this initiate a huge success. Chaudhary added that customized messages in Punjabi coupled with attractive animated videos are being sent to Anganwari workers, who forwarded these activity messages to the parents of the Anganwari-going children using various social media platforms to provide fascinating knowledgeable content to anganwari children in an amusing way.

Farmers Bill to go a long way in doubling income: Himachal CM,"  The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 passed by the Parliament is a pro farmer bill which would  not only provide better marketing facilities to the farmers to sell their produce but also go a long way in  achieving the target of Union Government to double the farmers income, Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said on Thursday. Talking to reporters, the  Chief Minister said that APMCs and Marketing Boards would continue to function as usual and grants in aid to develop market yards will   also continue. He said that Bill would create additional trading opportunities outside the APMC market yards to help farmers in getting better prices. He said that it would also allow development of private Mandi infrastructure in the State besides improving market access for the farmers by farm gate sales/mandis. Thakur said that after getting the consent of the President, the Act would help in introduction of new technologies in the farm sector through private investment. He said that the buyers and investors who directly purchased farm produce from the farmers would not have to pay any market fee or cess. It will motivate reputed agri business companies to purchase directly from the farm fields, he added. The Chief Minister said that focus would be on electronic mode of transactions which would help in meeting the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding ‘One Nation- One Market’.  He said that it would usher in development of cold chain infrastructure in the State as licensing would be deregulated which would ensure ease of doing business and increase investment in the agro processing sector. Accusing the Congress leaders for misleading the people of the State on the issue, he said that the Act would give price assurance of farm produce to the farmer at the time of sowing with better income options. He said that the farmers would be motivated to grow crops as per the demands of the market. Thakur said the Central Government was committed for socio-economic upliftment of the farming community and has initiated several schemes for their betterment. ATAL TUNNEL WILL STRENGTHEN SECURITY OF THE NATION, SAYS CM Ahead of the proposed visit of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday presided over a meeting of officers of Kullu district in Manali.

A helping hand to our sanitation workers,"  India’s rapid evolution post Independence into one of the largest economies in the world today has a lot to do with contributions from every segment of our society. In retrospect, it would perhaps not be incorrect to state that over the bygone decades, we have been successful in pushing several million Indians out of the lower layers of the existing societal strata. Yet, if there has been any inaction on our part to undertake administrative reform securing the valid interests of one particular group of people, it is our sanitation workers. Neglect and apathy towards sanitation workers, who shoulder the herculean task of keeping our towns and cities spick-and-span, has for long been the norm.  In recent years, our news channels have been flooded with the tragic stories of deaths of manual scavengers, the ones who help clean the gutters, sewer lines and the like. A national English daily reports that in 2019 alone, 110 such workers were killed due to no safety standards during their job. They have lived in marginalisation. This should prick our collective conscience because despite standing in the cusp of modernity, our society has failed them for so long. I appreciate the GARIMA scheme which has been launched under the astute leadership of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. Keeping the core sanitation workers and their needs in mind, the scheme shall act as a supportive pillar in their lives. This decision is certainly a pioneering effort in both its extent and magnitude. As an added plus, GARIMA shall cover not only the sanitation workers but also their families by providing them with financial support, access to healthcare facilities and administrative aid wherever necessary. The nitty-gritty has already been worked out; and by credible estimates, the plan shall initially extend immediate benefits to around one lakh people. On the administrative side, Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), retirement benefits and post-retirement pensions have been prioritised for these workers and their families. An initial corpus of ?50 crore has also been sanctioned by the State Government, which will help the cause further. Of course, this is the beginning. In the future, I am certain that the scheme shall be extended to cover all sanitation workers in the State who may at present have been left out of its ambit. My idea is that it is crucial to begin with whatever is at hand.  While the wrongs of the past cannot be wholly undone, it is upon our hands to effect whatever changes we possibly can because future is in our hands. I am hopeful and confident that GARIMA shall bring about a definitive transformation in the lives of our sanitation workers. (Dr Samanta is MP, Kandhamal, and founder, KIIT & KISS)  ",state-editions

Odisha still denies SC/ST/OBC status to Dalit Muslims,"  In recent times, the citizenship of the Muslims has been a hot topic for discussion, while many more important socio-economic issues concerning them are swept under the carpet.The issues of participation in employment, business, education, health and  access to basic amenities ,ownership over land and most importantly, participation in governance of the Muslims are ignored inspite of two major landmark commission reports on Indian minority in post independent India.  The first commission was headed by Justice Rajindara Sachar (2006), former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court and the second was headed by Justice Ranganath Mishra, former Chief Justice of India (2007). Both the reports are an eye-opener to public about the status of religious minorities in India. Among the religious minorities, the situation of Dalit Muslims is worst as they are prosecuted because of their caste based social identities. They continue to suffer inspite of change in their faith while they are almost disconnected from their social groups by legally losing status of Scheduled Caste. The SC status is not legally religion neutral and has been restricted to Hindu, Sikh (1955) and Buddhists (1990) only till date. The Dalit Muslims are also socially alienated from the major Dalit population of India commonly identified as Scheduled Caste. After OBC reservation, many of Dalit Muslims are included in OBC category in different States. Islam is the second largest religion of India. Studies by many such as ISI, New Delhi (2010), Abdur Rahman, Denial and Deprivation, (2019),Dalits in the Muslim and Christian communities ,National Commission for Minorities, repot by Satish Deshpande and Geetika Bapna, Department of Sociology ,University of Delhi (2008),  and the various commission reports found that the Muslim society in India is not homogeneous as they are divided into four major social and economic classes under the  influence of caste system in India.In Indian society the Ashraf, (Sayyads, Sheikhs, Mughals, Pathans) are the land owners, civil and religious leaders.   Ajlafs (mostly similar to Hindu Sudras/OBC) are mostly artisans and occupational groups such as barbar, tailor, weaver etc.   The Arzals are the lowest like their Hindu counterparts. The Arzals are the Dalits of the Muslim community. They constitute a separate most deprived group within the Muslim society. Similarly the untouchables/scheduled castes converted to Christianity are called as Dalit Christians.The change in religion has not contributed much to upgrade their social and economic status in the new religion and even within their own religious fraternity; rather they continue to face the same discriminatory treatment in social life and majority of them are engaged in age old unclean occupations such as scavenging, washing, cleaning etc. These issues are swept under the carpet. Landlessness is very high among these communities. They are deprived of basic amenities such as  homestead land , good housing , drinking water , toilet , electricity and sanitary facilities in their hamlets/Muhallas which are segregated in case of Dalit  Muslims. Usually the Government schemes very seldom reach to these hamlets because of their locations and discriminatory attitude of the governing elites. The condition of elders, women and children in family is very miserable. They cannot enter into any petty business but they are only selectively allowed to do few jobs since generations together. Very less has been done for their schooling and economic development and also for socialization and secularization. Inter caste /jamaats marriage is rare and often leads to social tension because of social hierarchy among Muslims. The suffering of Dalit Muslims is not addressed properly. The Kaka Kalelkara Commission of 1955 and Mandal Commission of 1980 have very well recognized the issues of social and educational backwardness among major Muslim groups /castes and recommended to include them in OBCs. The implementation of OBC reservation though is late but placed Muslims  as socially and educationally backward classes and also entitled them to avail reservation in education and jobs. The States such as Kerala ,Tamilanadu, AP ,Telengana and Karnataka, Manipur, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have made specific percentage of reservation for Muslims as backward class and most backward class. But in Odisha there is no minority commission and backward caste Muslims are not identified either as OBC or SEBC whereas Dalit Christians are included in the SCBC list in the State. Reservation in education and employment is necessary  to revamp the social and economic status of the downtrodden. It has certainly contributed to change hereditary  caste based occupations. Modern Education exposes to rational thinking, global outlook and aims at building a world where every individual lives with dignity and self-respect which Jyoti Rao Phule, Dr Ambedkar and  Sir Syed Ahamad Khan, Hamid Dalwai  always advocated for.  In Odisha minorities constitute 6 per cent of the total population of the State where Muslims with 10 lakh population account for 2.5 pet cent of the population. However, thr Muslim communities have been neglected much with denial of OBC or SEBC status.  The State Government has not set up any minority commission to look after the issues of minorities including Muslim minorities. There is no dedicated minority department with Minister from minority groups hrading it. Also there is absence of any minority financial corporation to encourage self-employment among minority youths. There is no allocation for upgrading of Madrasas for quality education of Muslim children and promotion of Urdu language. But almost all parties have minority cells to satisfy the minority political leaders as party agents. (manasbbsr15@gmail.com)  ",state-editions

BJP leader alleges sexual harassment,"  After Bharatiya Janata Party MLA in Aligarh created trouble for the party by threatening the local district police chief not to harass the party leaders in the beginning of this week, now a former office-bearer of BJP District Minority Cell in Aligarh alleged sexual harassment and attempt on life by a senior leader of her own party.  She too accused the local police of working under the influence of the BJP leader and claimed that instead of lodging an FIR, she made a complaint to senior party leaders, including the chief minister, requesting them to punish the guilty leader.  Farheen Mohisin, hailing from Usmanphada area of Delhigate in Aligarh, levelled sexual harassment charges against Imran Aleem Saifi, district president of the party’s minority cell in Aligarh.  She claimed that after she opposed his sexual advances and issued a warning, the leader sent his goons to her house and they attacked her and her husband last Monday. The entire incident was recorded on close circuit television.  Mohisin said that finding no other way and seeing that Imran was adamant to “outrage her modesty”, she had quit the party post. She was secretary in the district minority cell.  She denied lodging an FIR and said that she knew that some leaders were trying to bring a bad name to the party in Aligarh so she appraised the party top leadership of the issue and hoped that she would get justice.  Sources said that Imran denied all charges and claimed that efforts were made to malign his image.    Meanwhile, hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath government over its decision to put up posters of people accused of eve teasing, the Samajwadi Party on Thursday asked the government to put up posters of those supporting rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar and Swami Chinmayanand.

It should first say how many laws has it come up with in this regard so far. The government also said that those taking sides of the culprits will be punished. So will posters of those taking sides of rape accused like Kuldeep Singh Sengar and Chinmayanand will also be out up?,” the SP MLC asked. “We too believe that stringent action must be taken against the culprits, but let the courts do their work,” he said.

Bizarre case of teachers'  exploitation in Meerut,"  In a bizarre incident of exploitation through blackmailing in Meerut, as many as 52 teachers of a private school have collectively lodged a complaint with the local police allging that the school management was covertly filming them in the school’s washrooms and then using the videos and photographs to blackmail them into working without salary for several months. Sources said that the teachers, in their complaint, stated that the secretary of the school’s management committee threatened them with their objectionable photographs and videos whenever they asked for the payment of their pending salaries.  Based on the complaint, the police, on Wednesday, registered an FIR against the secretary and his son under sections 504 (intentional insult), 354 (a) (sexual harassment) and 354 (c) (voyeurism) of the Indian Penal Code. Meanwhile, the secretary dismissed the allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him.  “There is no CCTV inside the women’s toilet. But they have been installed in the gents’ toilets. This was done against the backdrop of recent cases of murder inside some schools,” the secretary told some media persons.  The secretary, however, admitted that for the past few months, the school had failed to pay salaries to the teachers. He attributed this failure to the ongoing pandemic situation. A case has been registered and investigation is underway, Station House Officer (SHO) of the Sadar Bazaar police station, Vijay Gupta said, adding that a team of officials from the forensic department has been roped in to provide assistance to the police in the investigation.  He said that the entire Close Circuit Television footage would be examined and the statements of the staff and even students would be recorded before initiating any action.  The financial record of the school will be also scrutinised to confirm whether the salaries were not paid due to money shortage or not.  It may be mentioned that in 2017, the same school had ordered its students to get their hair cut like chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The students were also asked to not keep beards as the school was “not a madarasa where people offer namaz”.  ",state-editions

The company also plans to take up the conversion of buses in the next phase and aims to completely shift to EVs by 2025, informed Public Relation Official ESL. Jharkhand has adopted an e-mobility program in partnership with the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). The Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) has signed an agreement with EESL for the deployment of 50 electric vehicles (EVs) at various JBVNL offices in Ranchi. In line with the mission of India and Jharkhand e-mobility program, ESL is planning to switch to electric vehicles in place of conventional vehicles run on petrol and diesel by 2025, said the official. The switching to Electric vehicles will help in Reduction in GHG emissions: The fuel efficiency is much more in EVs as compared to the conventional mode of transportation run by petrol and diesel. This initiative would reduce the scope of -3 emission of the industry; Reduction in Noise Pollution: EVs are generally quite silent and hence will produce less or no noise; Safe in nature: The chances of an explosion are very less as there is no use of inflammable substances in it. Moreover, because of the design feature, it is also less vulnerable to collision, he said. Shashi Bhushan Pandey, Chairman of Management Studies & Research Centre (MSRC), Bokaro said, “ It is an international endeavor to replace petroleum propulsion engines with an electric propulsion mechanism for better sustainable development of the society in respect of reduction of suspended particulate matter (SPM).” The children, old age people and population as a whole will not be affected by the smog creating environmental hazards in highly populated cities, said Pandey adding “The decision of ESL to set a target of 2025 to make ESL a company using only electric cars and buses, is highly appreciable and a strong initiative towards sustainable human development.” The idea of no-fly ash is also consistent with environment control since it is no more a pollutant but has become a raw material and ingredient for cement as well as other products using clay, he said.

RMC in a fix over operation of city buses,"  The city bus services of Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) is unlikely to start in the coming days as the corporation is undecided whether the resumption of bus service will be a wise decision in the wake of Covid-19 spreading unchecked. All 91 buses owned by RMC are out of the road right after nationwide lockdown was imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19 virus. After over five months of strict lockdown the state government partially allowed movement of buses when the government allowed intrastate bus service. But the RMC decided not to start bus service which is the lifeline of the city. “Officially, no decision has been taken regarding resumption of bus service. But RMC had indeed discussed as to when and how to start the bus service. The concerned file was sent to Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra but in the meantime she fell ill and till she recovers no decision can be taken on this matter. But chances are dim for early resumption of bus service. We can’t take any decision in a hurry,” said RMC deputy mayor Sanjeev Vijayvargia. RMC hires drivers for the bus service on the basis of certain payment. However, city bus service is not the major source of revenue for RMC but it is a preferred mode of transportation within the city limit by people. Sources in the RMC said that the fare chart will have to be revised since the operational cost of the bus is going to increase. “Now under the new rule a bus can carry passengers only half of the total seats of a bus. Some structural changes will be required inside the bus. In the emerging situation operating buses is not a normal affair. Now a lot of does and don'ts are involved. Like regular sanitization of seats, gate and handlebar, testing of passengers with infrared thermometer. These things require a lot of preparation,” said an official of RMC.

Production back on track at Adityapur Industrial Area,"  Asia’s largest industrial belt, Adityapur Industrial Area is back on the production track. With 80,000 workers back to work, the manufacturing units have revamped their production. Boosted by fresh orders, several industries are also running night shifts to meet the deadlines. City’s leading commercial vehicle maker, Tata Motors has given new orders to manufacture spare parts of 170 trucks per day to the ancillary units. The industrialists are hopeful that with fresh orders production will recover 80 per cent by the end of October. An industrialist, who owns an ancillary unit of Tata Motors in Adityapur, said: “The SME sector is dependent on heavy industries in Jamshedpur. Due to lockdown there was a slump in production. However, the industries have started giving us fresh orders that are helping us to boost production. We are confident that we will be able to recover the production loss by October”.  The sprawling Adityapur Industrial Area houses 1300 units- including 100 large-scale, 550 small scale and 350 tiny industries and most of these units depend on Tata Motors. A few important industries that have global presence are Usha Martin Group, RSB Group, Tata Steel Growth Shop(TGS) etc., too situated in this industrial belt, situated in Seraikela-Kharsawan. There are 20 industries, which export its products to the USA, Australia and other European countries. Sources informed that Tata Motors has also plans to manufacture about 250 vehicles per day from October at its plant and most of the work order will be given to its ancillaries at Adityapur. The move will further improve the industrial activities at the manufacturing hub. Tata Motors produces truck and bus chassis of various models by sourcing parts of the vehicles produced in the ancillary units in the Adityapur industrial area. After the lockdown started on March 25, assembling work at the Tata Motors plant came to a standstill. Ancillary units in Adityapur where some 1 lakh workers work also stopped to function. However, with the third phase of unlocking industrial units are back on the track. “We expect a fresh growth in the manufacturing sector at Adityapur with Tata Motors planning to enhance production. Workers are returning back to work. The move will help to provide fillip to industrial growth in Jharkhand,"" said Santosh Khetan, Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) functionary and ancillary unit owner.  ",state-editions
JPCC intensify protest against farm Bill,"  Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) on Wednesday decided that it will intensify protest against the Agricultural Products Trade and Commerce Bill and Agricultural Assurance Agreement bill passed by the Central Government. Addressing media persons here on Wednesday JPCC Chief Rameshwar Oraon said that the anti farmers draconian law will be written with black ink in the history of India. Congress workers will protest against this law against farmers and states in the entire State, he added. JPCC Spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo informed that JPCC In-Charge RPN Singh will hold an online press conference on September 24.  ""The party will hold a protest near Raj Bhawan against the draconian Act on September, 28 in which almost all senior officials of the party will be present and on October, 28 the party will protest at all district headquarters of the State,"" he added. A meeting of senior officials of JPCC was convened on Wednesday at the Congress Bhavan to discuss the issue and it was decided that the party will intensify protest against the bill across the State. ""The farmers fear that the minimum support price based procurement system will end and exploitation by private companies will increase. The strategy of statewide programs will be decided after the monsoon session. The bill will be opposed in the same way as the Central Government tried to tamper with the Land Acquisition Act,"" said Oraon. Attacking the Central Government, the JPCC Chief said that the law has been made in accordance with the big industrialists, who wish to dominate the Indian food and agriculture business, which will undermine the bargaining power of farmers. JPCC Spokespersons, Alok Dubey, Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo and Rajesh Gupta were also present in the meeting. Meanwhile, a delegation of teachers affected by the decision of Jharkhand High Court to cancel the teachers' appointment process, Ranchi, met JPCC Chief Rameshwar Oraon.

"Fresh lockdown, shutdown, hefty penalty must to save life","  The Union Government declared un-lockdown IV rather flatteringly. And most people including the urban intellectuals and the rural wise have gone berserk alike. Even officials, who felt panicky at the beginning with two infections per day, slowly became lax and casual by the time corona became a pandemic. Lockdowns had to be lifted in phases to save people from starvation. But the strategies have been ineffective. When the second lockdown was lifted, even judges of the apex court took the virus lightly and permitted the Puri Car Festival to happen, which definitely sent a wrong signal. The ordinary people began believing that the virulent pathogen was not really so dangerous. Coincidentally, more effective treatment protocols were found out and vaccine candidates showing up were big in number claiming to have passed the first two phases. Except responsible healthcare experts, every other pandemic manager including the ‘warrior’ behaved as if nothing had ever happened.  With un-lockdowns in place, provision markets had big crowds, most of them bumping into each other and without masks, and hand sanitisation only once in a while if the mood was fine. All this time, the virus was having the last laugh, its community multiplying like crazy.  Within two months, most places in India began experiencing a community transmission-like situation though Governments kept screaming, ' everything is under control' by furnishing impressive ratio and proportion of figures and numbers of the infected and deaths against gorier pictures elsewhere. It is now an established truth that careless behaviour and complacency are leading to a spike in Covid-19 cases everywhere, including Odisha which at the initial stage was role model with its timely lockdown and all risk-preventive measures. But when un-lockdowns started happening, without penal measures, at least a 65%-rise was marked in just two months. Corona will not kill many, but the huge pressure it will exert on the inadequate and fragile healthcare systems in most Indian states will for certain cause disaster beyond control. A senior official from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bhopal expressed concern over the populist Government’s latest guidelines allowing political, social and religious congregations of up to 100 people from September 21. Most other States are following suit as they are frantic to keep people cool. Earlier between March and April, there were corona-positive cases only with mild or no symptoms. That did not require critical care in hospitals. Today, the numbers of the infected have grown astoundingly big. Full-blown Covid cases are too many and most States are finding it difficult to provide matching number of even ordinary beds, let alone ICU facilities with life-supporting gadgets. Besides, medical doctors are proportionately dwindling in number with rising infection among them. There was a great hope that the virus would become weak by September and leave mankind by December though will not leave the planet soon.Until recently, the US was looked upon as the wisest nation with the best remedies for everything, mainly epidemics and pandemics. But they have erred horribly and have become suspect in their treatment methods and protocols. Drawing on a new survey-based research, generated from the Franklin Templeton-Gallup Economics of Recovery Study, it is found that American adults are dramatically misinformed about the mortality risks of Covid-19. On an average, Americans overstate risks to young people by a factor of 46 and understate risks to old people by a factor of two. The average American estimates that 8% of Covid-19 victims are aged 24 and younger, which is suspect. President Trump is a restless person and one in great hurry. He listens to all diverse, contradictory pieces of advice and jumps to bizarre conclusions every second week. Hence, the Americans are suffering more than others elsewhere in the world. Despite wealth and systems in place, the death rate is exceptionally high in the strongest nation of the world. In 2016, 8,970 Americans aged 24 and younger died from road accidents, implying that automobiles are 36 times more deadly than Covid-19. But for the elderly, the risk of dying from Covid-19 is 14 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident. Yet, American officials estimate it to be half that large. So, people did not take corona so very seriously at first. By the time they woke up, much irreparable damage was done already. It’s also true that authorities in the US do not want to see millions of healthy Americans locking themselves up at home, afraid to come across anyone outside their houses, even while wearing a mask and taking other reasonable precautions. These risk-avoidant behaviours have been disastrous to millions of essential workers and small business owners, who provide numerous personal care services. Notably, in Missouri two infected hairdressers did not transmit the virus to any of their clients despite 139 indoor visits in close proximity. The two hairdressers and their customers were all wearing the right-quality masks. But in India, masks are kept in pockets until police personnel are sighted. Or else, they keep hanging from the neck; they are never washed or dried in sun and the make is defective with single layer cloths. Social distancing is the last thing Indians can respect. Lockdowns and shutdowns have to be re-imposed without further delay. The panic of March has to be restored among people anyway. Only workplaces related to economic activities should be permitted to open, which is needed for livelihood and makes physical attendance inevitable.  Use of technology should be dragged to the brim and working online wherever possible be encouraged and rewarded. Videoconferencing can solve numerous ‘one-to-one and group interaction' problems so entertainingly. The containment of coronavirus depends on public awareness. It can be achieved only when people stop making ‘precaution mistakes'. The transmission gets more vigorous than before because of faulty awareness campaigns and approaches. Most of the IEC products scare the public and provoke the common man to begin hating and stigmatising the infected. This has resulted in people and families hiding the fact of infection. And the ‘asymptomatic infected' keep transmitting the virus as super-spreaders. The once-highly lauded Odisha Government permits wedding event congregations not exceeding 50 persons, violating which would attract a penalty of Rs 10,000. The groom, the bride and both the families would also be given exemplary punishment including custodial and pecuniary pain. As the picture is getting more and more frightening in Cuttack, Puri and Khordha districts due to larger flow of people, lockdowns and selective shutdowns have to be imposed forthwith to contain the virus.  The cities of Cuttack, Puri and Bhubaneswar must be taken very seriously. That would certainly save the people effectively. No other strategy appears in sight as of now.  ",state-editions

OHRC helps youth denied treatment at hospital,"  The Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC) on Wednesday ordered a Bhubaneswar private hospital to conduct surgery of an injured youth who tested positive for Covid-19. Hearing a petition filed by the injured youth’s brother, the OHRC asked the Director of KIMS hospital to immediately undertake surgery of the youth Ranjit Nayak if he is still admitted to the hospital. The cost of the treatment would be borne by the patient, the OHRC stated.In the petition, the injured youth’s brother Pabitra Nayak mentioned Ranjit was taken from one hospital to another for treatment after he suffered a stabbing injury on September 8. Ranjit was taken to Government hospitals like Capital Hospital, SCB Medical College Hospital, Cuttack, and AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, and some private hospitals, but he was turned away as he tested positive for Covid-19. Currently, he is admitted to the KIMS. The OHRC observed that the patient cannot be denied surgery on the plea of Covid-19 infection. The commission also asked the Secretary of the State Health and Family Welfare Department to probe the alleged medical negligence and submit a report during its next hearing on October 15.

Hirakud water level nears maximum point,"  The water level in Hirakud reservoir was just below the maximum point of 630 feet on Thursday. Current rains in the upper catchment area in Chhattisgarh due to low pressure in Bay of Bengal worried the dam authorities here as under the present situation with maximum water level (MWL) in hand they have no option than to make the inflow equal to outflow.“But we are relieved a lot as the inflow from Chhattisgarh has reduced drastically due to less rainfall there. The inflow was 2.5 lakh on Tuesday. We have no difficulty at present to handle with the situation with the decreased inflow,” said dam’s Superintend Engineer Bhakta Ranjan Mohanty. He said that the Kalma barrage also didn’t discharge more water during this peak hour.  He said water level would be reduced further if rains occur due to a low pressure expected on September 25. “There is nothing to be panicked now as we as a team are doing our best to handle the situation and we are more watchful towards September last and October first week,” Mohanty said.

"Go for fish seed production, bamboo handicrafts: CM","  Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Wednesday called for the promotion of high- quality fish seed production as well as bamboo handicrafts and farming in medicinal plants. Reviewing the workplan of ‘Livelihood Centres’ at the Gauthans and activities to be made operational at the centres, Baghel laid emphasis on promoting skill development through training in different sectors among the rural youth.

Keeping this in view, the fish producers should be imparted training if high quality and better species fish seed production. Similarly, with availability of bamboo in the state, bamboo handicrafts and farming in medicinal plants, including naturopathy, should be promoted. He stated that training on making of bamboo products to youths in districts where availability of bamboo is higher will provide them employment. In forest areas, medicinal plants farming along with training to establish naturopathy treatment centres will be promoted. These sectors will help bring income. According to Principal Secretary Dr Alok Shukla, it is estimated that around 20,000 youths have been trained in different sectors. The proposal is to produce cattle health worker, producer of organic fertilizer and different materials from cow dung, nursery worker, gardeners and makers of bamboo products among others.

BBSR to have uniform heritage signage,"  The Heritage signage guidelines will further boost the overall beauty and attractiveness of heritage zones of Bhubaneswar, known for its fascinating cultural heritage, amazing temples and monuments by bringing a uniformity in signage design and installation. The signage based on the new guidelines will immensely help visitors, national and international tourists in finding and knowing about various monuments and archaeological sites in the capital city leading to generating awareness among people towards cultural heritage. At present, different types of signages have been installed in Ekamra Kshetra by various agencies leading to visual clutter and absence of proper interpretation signage creates confusion among visitors. Therefore, in 2016, the BDA had identified the need to develop guidelines for unified signage designs for special heritage zones as specified in CDP – 2030.BDA Vice-Chairman Prem Chandra Chaudhary said, “As the Old Town or Ekamra Kshetra of Bhubaneswar is one of the most prominent abodes of Lord Shiva, the heritage signage guideline will bring in a perfect sync with the past and the present as this area is the essence of the State capital."" Similar guidelines would also be prepared for other special heritage zones identified under CDP 2030 which will bring uniformity in information dissemination and to improve the overall visitor experience, he added. He further informed that the BDA is also aiming to notify the street design guidelines at the earliest under ODA Rules 2020. The signage guidelines will be applicable to the proposed Heritage District in Bhubaneswar Development Plan Authority as per its Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP)-2030, which includes ‘Ekamra Kshetra Heritage Zone (Old Bhubaneswar), Aitihashik Kshetra Heritage Zone (Sishupalgarh) and Sanskritik Kshetra Heritage Zone (Dhauli). The colour, font, line spacing, paragraph style, arrows and icons, material and scale of all signs should be historically sensitive to monument/building anddistinctiveness of old town area. These signage guidelines will be adopted as part of BDA (Planning and Building standard) Regulations. As per the new guidelines, following six types of signages will be put up at heritage sites such as, directional, interpretative, orientation, facility signage, business and building signage. As per provision of  Odisha Shops and Commercial Establishments (Amendment) Act, 2018, name of a business establishment in the area would be written in Odia language and if required, it can be written in English as a supporting text.

Ensure adequate medical oxygen supplies for Punjab from other States: Capt to Modi,"  Amid apprehensions of shortage of medical oxygen with rising cases, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct urgent steps to ensure adequate supplies from other states. At the same time, the Chief Minister also sought expeditious release of Rs 200 crore that the State Government had requested as the next tranche of central aid for COVID-19 management. With experts suggesting possible aggravation of COVID-19 conditions due to stubble burning, the Chief Minister also reiterated his demand for fiscal aid by the Centre to farmers for defraying the cost on management of paddy straw. The CM maintained that even though the State Govt is launching an aggressive media campaign to educate farmers and people in general, giving the linkage with COVID-19, he insisted that it was imperative for the Central Government to step in with the Rs 100 per quintal compensation the State has been seeking for the farmers to manage the paddy straw. During a virtual meeting with the PM, the Chief Minister also urged him to direct the Chief Controllers of Explosives, Nagpur, to clear the license request for establishment of a liquid medical oxygen plant at Government Medical College, Patiala, by HLL India Limited, under the PM Swasthya Surkhsha Yojna (PMSSYSY). The Prime Minister, while promising to look into the Chief Minister’s requests, suggested that the State Government should strengthen its COVID-19 awareness efforts by involving the civil society even more aggressively and making announcements from Gurdwaras and other religious places. Modi also expressed confidence that Punjab would be able to reduce the positivity rate to less than five percent and bring down the COVID Fatality Rate (CFR). ON SUPPLY OF MEDICAL OXYGEN Noting that government and private hospitals in Punjab could end up facing shortage of medical Oxygen supply due to the late surge of COVID-19 cases, Capt Amarinder informed the PM that with no manufacturers of medical oxygen, the State was largely dependent on three big manufacturers for liquid oxygen — Baddi (Himachal Pradesh), Dehradun (Uttarakhand), and Panipat (Haryana). Dehradun and Panipat plants are not supplying oxygen as per the state’s demand, he said, adding that the Panipat plant can supply more oxygen if supply to Panipat Refinery is curtailed. “Punjab Government, on its part, is in talks with industry to convert industrial oxygen to medical oxygen,” he said. ON FISCAL PACKAGE FOR COVID Demanding financial assistance, the Chief Minister pointed out that the Central Govt has released Rs 131.22 crore from the Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund, and after submitting a Utilization Certificate for the whole amount, the State had requested the Centre for immediate release of Rs 200 crore, which is awaited. “The Govt of India was requested to reconsider the limit of 35% expenditure for COVID relief under SDRF from the overall availability of the resource envelope, but the Centre is still continuing with 35 percent limit on SDRF for COVID on yearly basis,” he pointed while requesting the PM to make this limit as overall limit or removed altogether as the pandemic is going to stay for a long time. STRENGTHENING MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE To further strengthen the state’s fight against COVID-19, the Chief Minister also requested that installation of ventilators provided by the Centre be completed at the earliest. He also pointed out the complaints of their malfunctioning by both public and private healthcare institutions. The Chief Minister urged the Centre to direct the PGIMER, Chandigarh, to add more ICU beds, and also to strengthen their Satellite Centre at Sangrur and initiate work in Ferozepur, as requested even earlier. AIIMS, Bathinda may be asked to increase beds for COVID, which is currently only 20, he added. STATE’s COVID STATUS Updating the Prime Minister on the state’s COVID situation, Capt Amarinder said that the last three to four weeks had seen surge in cases, and, on an average, in the past week, around 2400-2500 cases and around 55-60 mortalities were reported daily.  “The main concern is the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR), which remains high at 2.9 percent despite some reduction in the past one week,” he said while listing several measures being undertaken to check CFR, especially in the nine worst-affected districts of the state. ON HINDRANCES “The major problem is the casual (chalda hai) attitude of Punjabis, who do not take minor symptoms seriously. The problem has been compounded by the ongoing protests, where even certain parties, like Lok Insaaf Party, have been spreading propaganda against the need to wear masks,” he said, adding that 25 percent people, especially in congested areas, were not wearing masks and the police had been fining 4,000 to 5,000 violators every day. The Chief Minister also referred to the recent “disinformation campaign” by mischief mongers, some of whom had political links also and had been carrying out a very organized campaign, terming COVID as a conspiracy by Governments of India and Punjab and spreading false information on harvesting of organs. “This became very active on social media, and some panchayats passed resolutions against testing, videos went viral and a general perception of fear was created among people against COVID testing,” he said adding that the situation had now improved, and the state is currently doing around 30,000 tests daily on both RT-PCR and RAT, and aims to take it to 40,000 soon.

The Bill was neither put on the agenda of the Lok Sabha yesterday nor the Rajya Sabha today. Even today, it was passed at the last minute in the absence of the opposition,” said Sukhbir. This is the second time that the SAD which is already standing against its ally, the BJP, on the issue of farm bills, has lashed out on the saffron party for “misusing” its “brute majority” to pass a bill in the House. Earlier, the Akali Dal criticized the way the farm bills were passed in both the Houses — Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha — allegedly ignoring rules. Sukhbir condemned that the Bill was taken up for approval without taking into consideration the objections of SAD as well as other regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir. “While speaking in the Lok Sabha, I had pointed out that Punjabi is not only the mother tongue of a large number of people of the Union Territory but is also a recognized language as per the Constitution of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir,” he pointed. He added, “Dr Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference, who is a former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, supported me and said that a sizable number of Kashmiris also spoke Punjabi. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has also supported the inclusion of Punjabi as an official language in the union territory”. Terming the entire development as a “sad day for democracy”, Sukhbir said that the founding fathers of the Constitution were inspired by a vision of India as a multi religious, multicultural and multilingual nation and respect for regional languages was seen an important tool to preserve and promote this ideal. He also expressed anguish that while Punjabi had been excluded from the list of official languages, English had been included in the list. “This is sure to hurt the sentiments of Punjabis in Jammu and Kashmir as well as everywhere else”, he added.

Guest lecture held on tenth day of Hindi fest ‘Toornayad’,"  On the tenth day of Toornayad a guest lecture was organised at Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT).  Chinmay Pandya, the vice-chancellor of Dev Sanskriti University was present as the guest speaker on Wednesday. Toornayad is the Hindi festival organised every year at MANIT. it invites students from all technical colleges of the country to participate in various events. He addressed the youngsters on Self Reliant India and self-reliance.  Chinmaya Pandya left his job as a doctor in England and returned to India with a sense of service to the motherland. Since 2010, he has been continuously serving as the vice-chancellor of Dev Sanskriti University, as well as playing important responsibilities in much-reputed Government and non-Governmental organizations at the national and international level. More important than being self-reliant it is to depend on oneself. Starting his speech with the utterance of Gayatri Mahamantra,  Chinmay said that more important than being self-reliant is to depend on the soul. He said that today’s odd circumstances create terror in the human mind, but at the same time, it gives good and awakened souls the determination to do something and come forward. Highlighting the present circumstances, Pandya said that whatever be the external form of today’s society, but the internal is hollow. The faster the size of homes has grown, the faster the family is limited. Today, doubt, doubt and harshness have taken the place of belonging, affection and trust from the heart of man.  That is why today there is a need for awakened souls to come forward and elevate humanity from this dark environment. Citing the story of King Bharata and Narada Muni, Pandya said that instead of conquering everything, we need a victory over our personality. We value internal excellence rather than external achievements because it is impossible to take away. At the end of the lecture, the committee’s alumni president, Abhilash Pateria, thanked Chinmaya Pandya and extended his best wishes to the event.  ",state-editions
"No party has misguided farmers, says Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union prez","  Claiming that no political party has misguided the farmers over the agriculture bills passed in Parliament, Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Chaduni on Wednesday said that farmers are fully aware about the farm bills and they are just seeking a law which ensures assured Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops. Talking to The Pioneer on phone, he said that the legislators of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) should listen to their inner voice and join agitation against anti-farmer bills. He said the agitation has received a warm response from labourers to traders despite the Centre and BJP- ruled State Government’s campaign in favour of these bills. “We have appealed to the traders and shopkeepers to shut down their establishments in support of farmers against these bills. The peaceful agitation has been called and will further be intensified in coming days,"" he added. Chaduni who is leading farmers’ agitation against Centres’ three contentious farm bills in Haryana claimed that the State has witnessed such a big stir after many years. The Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, were passed by the Upper House recently through voice vote despite objection from farmers. He said, “We hope that MLAs of BJP and JJP will listen to their inner voice and would come forward in support of farmers who have been demonstrating the passage of agricultural reform bills in the parliament.” He alleged that through these passed bills, the ruling party is trying to benefit the big business. Asked whether these bills have become political, Chaduni said that this has become people’s issue as the opposition did not play its due role when three ordinances were introduced. They are playing a better role now after farmers stir picked up. Responding to a question that Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has recently appealed to farmers to talk to the State Government, he said, “BJP Government had never invited farmers for talks to redress their concerns in the past few years. We are ready to talk to the Government if they invite us to discuss issues pertaining to farmers of the State.” Responding to the question that Haryana Chief Minister also assured farmers' of not ending the MSP of crops, he said that if this system is not being ended, then why maize was not purchased at the rate of MSP. In place of MSP of Rs 1,760 per quintal, the farmers sold maize to private players in the range of just Rs 800 to 1,100 per quintal. Why did (the government agencies) procure only 25 per cent of total gram (at the rate of MSP)? The government is withdrawing its hand from offering support price to the crops of farmers. Asked about the BJP's charge that farmers are being misguided by the opposition leaders, Chaduni said that no one can misguide the farmers. This issue is not related to Congress, JJP and BJP but of the people of the country. He alleged that JJP has failed to raise the voice of Haryana farmers. “If Dushyant wants to keep hopes of farmers alive, he should move out of the alliance government in the interest of the farmers. Farmers gave Dushyant votes with the hope that he will work for their welfare. He got the anti-BJP votes. But in his hunger for power, he has put all those votes in the pocket of the BJP. The BJP has now brought out a death warrant for the farming sector. He should withdraw support from the BJP-JJP government.” On the recent hike in MSP for Rabi crops, he said that the hike in the MSP is insufficient in comparison to the rate of inflation. Normally, the MSP is declared at the end of October or initial period of November, but this time they have declared it one and half months in advance. This is just an attempt to convince the farmers that MSP is not being discontinued. Chaduni further said that with the passage of these bills in both the Houses of the parliament, now the entire agriculture business will go into the hands of few private capitalists. Agricultural produce will go to them and people of the country will purchase food grains from them at much higher prices. Currently, the government purchases food grains and supplies to the poor (at cheaper rates) as the government doesn't believe in profit making. Farmers are just seeking a law from the Union Government which ensures assured Minimum Support Price (MSP) of the crops, he added.    ",state-editions

"Govt failed to secure interest of tribals, natives, says BJP","  The State BJP on Tuesday attacked the Hemant Soren led government on the recruitment policy issue. Reacting sharply to the Chief Minister's statement on the recruitment policy at a press conference here on Tuesday, State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that this government is not able to protect the interests of tribal and indigenous people of the State. On the decision of the High Court, Shahdeo said that the government did not present its right side on the recruitment policy of the erstwhile Raghuvar government. Pratul said that the local policy framed by the Raghuvar government was upheld by the  High Court, but this government could not defend the recruitment policy properly, which created a job crisis on thousands of tribal native youth. He said that when the Hemant government could not protect the 1985 cutoff date, what would it be able to do on the cutoff date of 1932. That is why the BJP clearly believes that this government is a useless government. He said that to protect the officers, the government takes help of renowned counsels to strongly present the government’s side in the court, but when there is a matter of protecting the employment of tribal native youth of the State, the government does not bring lawyers like Harish Salve and Nariman to put the State’s side. Pratul said that if the state government had been friendly to the tribal natives, the Supreme Court would have intervened in the 'Leela Prasad Rao' case of Andhra Pradesh because the decision had far-reaching effects on Jharkhand. Pratul said that the Supreme Court had also ruled in the decision of Vikas Pratap Singh v. Government of Chhattisgarh that the earlier appointments would not be affected, but the State Government did not put its stand in the High Court in a good way. Para 47 of the High Court decision clearly states that there is no restriction on the appointment of assistant candidates to the Panchayat Secretary, but the government has held this appointment for a long time. Pratul said that after the year 2017, all the appointments of classes three and four in the State have been done from the local residents of Jharkhand. He said that the state government only makes unreal announcements to give jobs to the local people but it is not intended to give employment to the tribal native youth of the State.

Vijay Deo Jha,"  A day after Jharkhand High Court judgment striking down 100 percent quota in class III and class IV jobs in scheduled districts of Jharkhand; the ruling JMM said that the government will formulate ‘local residence and employment policy for Jharkhand’ afresh. On Monday Jharkhand High Court scrapped recruitment process of high school teachers issued by the government in 2016 under which the government had prescribed 100 per cent reservation to local residents in 13 scheduled districts. The high court also declared all appointments made against the said advertisement to be null and void which is set to render as many 5,000 teachers jobless. Advertisement for teachers’ appointment was issued a few months after the then BJP-Ajsu Party led government headed by Raghubar Das introduced local residence and employment policy for Jharkhand. 1985 was fixed as the cut off year to fix domicile status for residence and the government also formulated a rule for 100 percent appointment to local residents of scheduled districts in the government job. Addressing a press conference at the party office on Tuesday afternoon; JMM general secretary Suprio Bhattacharya accused the BJP of creating a mess. “We had opposed it when the BJP government introduced this divisive policy. We had warned the government that 1985 as a cut off year will be detrimental to the interest of people of Jharkhand. We had a clear cut understanding that on the name of scheduled districts the BJP is dividing people. The then BJP government that cobbled a majority post-election with help of Babulal Marandi hatched conspiracy and played with the lives of youths,” Bhattacharya said. As the High Court judgement has created a constitutional crisis and surcharged political atmosphere the JMM said that chief minister Hemant Soren heading JMM-Congress-RJD government will bring a fresh local residence and employment policy. “The government will soon bring the policy and we assure justice to all. The 2016 policy was a document of fraud and the fraud has been exposed. Das heading the previous government for five years committed heinous sins. The previous government made people suffer,” he said.        ",state-editions

"Govt running away from discussion, says Qazi Nizamuddin","  Launching an assault on the state government for merely fulfilling its constitutional obligation by organising a one day monsoon session, the Manglaur MLA and senior Congress leader Qazi Nizamuddin has said that the state government is running away from dialogue.  Terming dialogue as a key for success of democracy, the Congress leader said that it is unfortunate that the present regime is not giving the elected representatives the right of asking questions. Addressing a virtual news conference on Tuesday Nizamuddin said that issues like pandemic of Covod-19 and failure of government to deal with it, unemployment, returnees during the lockdown, price rise, plight of farmers, recent disaster in many parts of the state, closure of industries, pending payment of sugarcane farmers, pathetic condition of tourism, Lokayukta and preparation for Kumbh are some of the many issues which demand immediate discussion. He said that the BJP government has not fulfilled its promise of loan waiver of farmers. The Congress leader also took the government to task for showing an apathetic attitude towards the Kumbh works.

"Farmers block NH, protest farm Bills","  Hundreds of farmers under the banner of the Navnirman Krusak Sangathan (NKS) blocked the National Highway at Chandikhol in Jajpur district on Tuesday opposing the farm reform Bills recently passed in Parliament. NKS national coordinator Akshya Kumar led the protest and thanked the farmers for coming out in large numbers against the three farm Bills.Farmer leaders alleged that the Bills are aimed at benefiting big corporate houses and ending the minimum support price-based procurement of farm produce by the Government, said Kumar. Notably, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 permits electronic trading of farmers’ produce and allows setting up of transaction platforms for facilitating direct online buying and selling of farm products. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 provides for a farming agreement prior to production or rearing of any farm produce. A guaranteed price to be paid for purchase of farming produce will be mentioned in such agreements.  ",state-editions
Punjabi singers extend support to Sep 25 bandh call given by farmers’ unions,"  Many Punjabi singers have extended their support to the September 25 Punjab ‘bandh’ call given by farmers’ unions against the new farm bills. Around 30 farmers’ outfits have given a call for the complete shutdown of Punjab on September 25 in protest against the bills. Punjabi singer and actor Harbhajan Mann has appealed to people to support the bandh call. Mann, in a tweet, said he, along with several other artists, would be participating in the Punjab bandh protest. Another famous singer Babbu Mann also came out in support of the ‘chakka jaam’ on September 25. In a video uploaded on his Instagram account, he urged people to unite for the farmers’ cause. Farmers in Punjab have been protesting against the three bills. They have expressed apprehension that the three bills will pave a way for dismantling the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates. The Rajya Sabha passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 during the day. It had cleared the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 on Sunday. The bills had been passed by Lok Sabha last week. Singer Sidhu Moosewala, in a video, said he stands with farmers who had been protesting against the farm bills. “We will hold ‘rosh pardarshan’ (protest) in Mansa,” he said, adding that he would soon share the details of the protest. He also appealed to people to come out and support farmers in their struggle. A few days ago, singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh had voiced his support for farmers and tweeted, “Kisaan Bachao, Desh Bachao. Kisaan Virodhi Bill Da Asi Sarey Virod Karde Haan (Save farmers, save the country. We all oppose the anti-farmer bills).”            ",state-editions
Punjab’s 3 Govt medical colleges to participate in phase -III trials of Covaxin from October 15,"  Punjab’s three Government Medical Colleges will participate in the Phase III trials of the COVAXIN, being tested by Bharat Biotech Limited in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) against the COVID pandemic.

"If needed, masks will be provided to Govt school students: Gujjar","  After the second day of reopening of Government Schools for the students studying in Classes IX-XII, Haryana Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar on Tuesday said that the number of students who attended their Schools was comparatively low but with the passage of time in the next 10 days, their attendance would increase. Owing to rising cases of Covid-19, wearing masks has been made mandatory for the students along with strict implementation of other necessary guidelines. “In the last two days, so far all the students attended their school wearing masks located in rural and urban areas and sought guidance from their teachers. If needed, masks will be provided to students by the State Government,” he added. Talking to The Pioneer over Phone, Gujjar said that the decision of reopening of Government School was taken in compliance with the Unlock-4 guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Teachers should go for Covid-19 testing periodically and for this, the health department has made proper arrangements regarding the same. Responding to a question that private school operators criticising the State Government for charging fee from private school teachers for Covid-19 test, Gujjar said that this issue has not come yet before the Government but will be taken care of. The Education Minister said that online teaching would continue in the State. As per reports from the districts, the Covid-19 standard operating procedures were being followed strictly in Government Schools, where students were being thermally scanned and made to wash and sanitise their hands. “The schools opened after six months for “consultation” for classes IX to XII.  Gujjar said that schools were earlier asked by the authorities concerned to follow all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and all the necessary arrangements were made for smooth conduct of the schools. A Senior Education officer from Panchkula said that after remaining shut for the past six months due to the Covid-19 outbreak, schools partially reopened on Monday to enable students studying in Classes IX to XII to visit their institutions on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers. “The State Govt had recently allowed students of Class IX to XII to visit their schools in areas outside Covid-19 containment zones only, on voluntary basis for academic guidance. The students carried written permission that had consent of their parents or guardians allowing them to visit schools for guidance from teachers. It has been made mandatory for teachers to download the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones and all were required to take a Covid-19 test before September 21.” A principal of a government school in Panchkula said that students of higher classes, who visited the school to seek teachers’ guidance, were allocated different time slots to ensure only a few students are present inside the school at a given time. She also said that despite education being imparted online these days, as schools are shut, many students were excited to visit the school after a long gap and meet their teachers. “The teachers too were happy to see them after months. Even students were happy to be back in school, even if regular classes had not resumed yet. We were expecting more students in line with the consent forms we had received.  However, it seems parents have changed their mind and are not willing to send their wards to school.  We are taking every precaution in view of the pandemic and following all the government guidelines,” she said. A Govt School teacher said that the attendance of the students was low as some parents might have been apprehensive as coronavirus cases had surged in the State and elsewhere. Teachers were instructed not to share books, dusters, chalks with either students or other teachers.  “We expect more students to join in the coming days, but the decision lies solely with the parents because they should feel comfortable in sending their children to school,” she added.

CM to raise issue of augmentation of oxygen supplies from other States,"  Prime Minister Narendra Modi will review the COVID-19 response in Punjab, which is witnessing ‘higher than national average’ deaths and infection rate. In Punjab, the case fatality rate due to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 positivity rate is higher than the national average. Punjab, which has reported an increase in the number of cases being reported recently coupled with escalating deaths, has CFR of 2.89 percent (as on Tuesday), while the state’s positivity rate on Tuesday was recorded at 5.22 percent. In all, the Prime Minister will hold a virtual meet with the Chief Ministers of seven states, including Punjab, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi where 65.5 percent of the country’s total confirmed cases, 77 percent of total deaths, and more than 63 percent of the active cases are concentrated. During the Wednesday’s virtual meeting, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh would raise the issue of augmentation of Oxygen supplies from other states. “I will urge the Prime Minister to issue the necessary directions to the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which are currently Punjab’s main source of medical oxygen,” said the Chief Minister. We need to ensure that there are enough supplies in Punjab to save lives, the Chief Minister said amid reports of 14 percent death rate in the three Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals (GMCs) at Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot, which are engaged in providing tertiary care of COVID-19 patients. The Chief Minister asked the Departments to work towards bringing the death rate in these GMCs to below 10 percent at the earliest. The state Medical Education Secretary DK Tiwari, during the virtual COVID review meeting chaired by the Chief Minister, asserted that while there was no shortage of Oxygen in Punjab at present, “but, if occupancy goes up to 100 percent, more supplies would be needed”. “Nodal officers deputed to monitor the supplies from the three units in Himachal, Haryana and Uttarakhand are keeping the supplies streamlined,” he said. The state Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and Medical Education and Research Minister OP Soni stressed that oxygen should be diverted from industry if required.

Navjot Sidhu to bat for farmers,"  Formally announcing his decision to join the team farmers to bat for them against the Centre’s recently-enacted three farm bills, the former cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday called for taking the movement to the masses. Sharing a video on his YouTube channel ‘Jittega Punjab’, the Congress leader Navjot Sidhu has asked all the political parties, farm unions, and every Punjabi, right from old to the young ones, to be on the same page for opposing these “black laws” till the end. Sidhu, who has decided to come out of his year-long political exile for the farmers’ cause, on Tuesday announced that he would be holding protests against the controversial farm bills from his Amritsar East constituency on Wednesday. His announcement came a day after the party legislators in Punjab, in response to the Congress high command’s call, held state wide protests against the Bills. Batting for formulating a common minimum programme to strategically fight against the Centre’s move, Sidhu maintained that challenging the Bills in the Supreme Court appears to be the best way to counter the Central Government’s decision. “The BJP has got the Bills passed in both the House, and there are negligible chances for the President to counter the Centre’s move…I have also done the politics of solution and not just discussed the problem,” he said. He also claimed that the Bills could not only lead to “unprecedented” food inflation, he said that it would also legitimize hoarding, and the hoarders would sell that produce at much higher prices, leading to food inflation. The former Minister alleged that the Government at the Centre always “went out of the way to help capitalists by waiving Rs 4 to 5 lakh crore taxes and giving subsidies and rebates in taxes…But when the time comes for giving MSP to farmers, there is so much hue and cry,” he said, adding that the GST killed traders. These black laws are ruining farmers. Around 28,000 arthiyas and four to five lakh mandi labourers will also be hit”. Sidhu said that these farm bills would affect the state’s revenue from mandis. He alleged that the Centre was replacing the “successful mandi model” with the “free market model” that had failed in the USA and Europe.  ",state-editions
SAD chakka jam decision clear bid to exploit farmers sentiment and perhaps even sabotage their fight: CM,"  Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday termed the Akalis’ decision to hold a state-wide chakka jam on September 25, the day when Punjab’s farmers had already announced a Bandh against the Farm Bills, as yet another brazen attempt by the BJP ally to exploit the sentiments of the farmers, and perhaps even to sabotage the farmers’ fight at the behest of their allies in the Central Government. “Why don’t you go to Delhi and do a chakka jam outside the homes of BJP leaders and others who have shamelessly sold off the interests of Punjab’s farmers to the big corporate houses for their own petty interests?” the Chief Minister said, daring the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to quit the Central Government if it really cared for the farmers. Capt Amarinder lambasted SAD president Sukhbir Badal and his wife Harsimrat for continuing to indulge in their hypocritical pretense of standing with the farmers in the face of the blatant attack on their livelihood by the very Government of which the Akalis are a part. “What are these double standards? Why did your Core Committee today not take a decision on quitting the BJP-led NDA coalition?” he asked Sukhbir. Questioning the SAD announcement of holding chakka jams across Punjab “in league with the farmers, khet mazdoors and arhtiyas’, the Chief Minister said this clearly exposed the Akalis’ malicious intentions, since the farmers’ and other organisations had already declared a Bandh for September 25 several days ago, when the Akalis were still busy projecting the unconstitutional and dangerous Agriculture Bills as beneficial for the farming community. There is clearly some malafide intent behind the Akalis’ decision to jump, at this juncture, into the farmers’ pre-planned agitation, he said, adding that the farmers will not be fooled by these antics. The games that the SAD, led by the Badals, has been playing with the farmers for the past several months, beginning with the introduction of the vicious Ordinances, have totally exposed their double standards on this issue of critical importance not just to the farmers of Punjab but to the entire state, said Captain Amarinder. The Centre is clearly out to ruin Punjab, and the Akalis have been actively supporting this agenda with all their might, he said, adding that their purported U-turn or rethink on the issue also appears to be a conspiracy to undermine their agitation. Meanwhile, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Sunil Jakhar said the Congress, which has always fought for, and protected, the rights and interests of the farmers, stands firmly behind them in the most difficult moment in the history of Indian Agriculture. Punjab Congress MPs and leaders are camping in Delhi, fighting the Centre’s despotic attempts to stifle their voices and bravely facing the brute force of the BJP-controlled Delhi Police, he said, asserting that the party will not succumb to these high-handed measures and will not relent.

SAD to hold ‘chakka jam’ on Sept 25 across Punjab,"  Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday announced a ‘sangharsh’ programme to get the agricultural Bills reversed, including a state-wide ‘chakka jam’ on September 25 as well as a simultaneous ‘kisan march’ from all three Sikh religious ‘Takths’ to Mohali on October 1 to hand over a memorandum for the President of India to the State Governor. The decisions were taken at a meeting of the party’s core committee, which also decided that SAD president would visit various parts of the State to interact with the party cadre from September 26 to 29. “The core committee decided to hold a ‘chakka jam’ across the State on September 25. Party leaders and workers have been asked to hold ‘chakka jam’ in all constituencies in league with farmers, khet mazdoor (farm labourers), and arhtiyas (commission agents). The party will observe a three-hour programme from 11 am to 2 pm,” said SAD spokesman and former minister Daljit Singh Cheema, adding that the party workers have, however, been asked not to come in way of emergency services. The core committee also decided to hold a ‘kisan march’ from state’s all three religious ‘Takths’ (temporal seats) — Akal Takth Sahib (Amritsar), Damdama Sahib (Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda), and Keshgarh Sahib (Sri Anandpur Sahib) — on October 1. While the SAD president would lead the march from Damdama Sahib, former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal would lead the march from Akal Takth Sahib, and Prof Prem Singh Chandumajr and Daljit Singh Cheema would lead the march from Sri Keshgarh Sahib; and the senior party leaders would participate in the march. The march would culminate at the Dussehra ground in Mohali following which a delegation of senior party leaders would give a memorandum to the Punjab Governor for the President Ram Nath Kovind.   SAD TO APPROACH ALL LIKE MINDED PARTIES After cropping of fissures between its age old ally, the BJP, over the farm bills, the SAD core committee has decided to contact all likeminded regional parties across the country to evolve a joint strategy to forge a united fight to get the anti-farmer Bills revoked.  The party also resolved to pursue all logical steps to ensure the discrimination being meted out to the farmers was removed.   SUKHBIR ASKS CM TO HOLD SPECIAL ASSEMBLY SESSION TO REVOKE AMENDED APMC ACT SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday asked the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to hold a special assembly session immediately to revoke the amended State Agriculture Produce Markets Committee (APMC) Act of 2017. “The Chief Minister should not practice deceit with farmers by shedding crocodile tears at their fate while he is the author of the same legislation in Punjab and continues to stand by his own anti-farmer Act,” said Sukhbir. He asked the Chief Minister to tell the farmers and ‘khet mazdoor’ of Punjab why he is refusing to rescind the State APMC Act, 2017, which he has implemented in his own State as CM. “Could you show moral courage to disassociate yourself from the Congress’ 2019 manifesto which called for removing APMC Act all together,” he questioned the CM while asking him to apologize to the farming community for encouraging corporatization of the farm sector by accepting the Montek Singh Ahluwalia committee report which calls for reducing procurement of foodgrain. He asked the chief minister to scrap the committee and reject its report which he termed as a death warrant for Punjab farmers.  ",state-editions

10 ‘trafficked' child labourers rescued in city,"  The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has rescued 10 child labourers from New Delhi Railway Station. The children were being trafficked from Jainagar, Bihar to work in Delhi-NCR and Ambala, and most of them were found unaware of being forced into child labour. They were in unsafe and unhygienic conditions, without wearing masks. The children were rescued by the teams, successfully and provided with masks and sanitizers along with refreshments. A senior government official said statements of the  rescued children have been recorded, followed by medical tests including COVID-19 test. “The children will be produced before a Child Welfare Committee on Wednesday through video-conferencing and meanwhile, they will stay at Child Care Institution at Lajpat Nagar.” Two days ago, in a late-night operation, the DCPCR in coordination with SHO (Old Delhi) and teams from NGOs Bachpan Bachao Andolan and ChildLine-Salaam Baalak Trust rescued six children who were being trafficked from Bihar to work as labourers in Delhi. With the outbreak of COVID-19 and ensuing lockdown, there has been a drastic impact on the income of families. The traffickers have been targeting poor families in Bihar, persuading them to send their children on the pretext of giving employment. DCPCR has taken note of the dramatic increase in child labour during the pandemic and has been working on a fire-fighting mode to curb it through a multi-stakeholder approach, coordinating with all stakeholders including Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), Mandi Associations, Private Schools Associations etc. of Delhi. The Commission is in process of evolving a comprehensive long-term strategy to make Delhi Child Labour Free by 2023. Anurag Kundu, Chairperson, DCPCR outlined the Commission’s scheme for providing financial incentive for reporting of child labour. He urged citizens to pro-actively report instances of child labour and win cash award upto to Rs. 10,000. He further elaborated that the Commission is building an early warning system to determine child adversity using children’s school attendance as an indicator. It is in the process of laying down processes to activate a series of actions and interventions in the event of children remaining absent from the schools for more than 50 percent days.

Signboard of road named after Swami Vivekananda vandalised in JNU: ABVP,"  The Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Jawahalal Nehru University, (JNU) unit has filed a police complaint alleging that the signboard of a road named after Swami Vivekananda in the campus has been vandalised. Police said they have received a complaint and are looking into the matter. The ABVP termed the vandalism a pre-planned attack on the ideologically diverse nature of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus. The ABVP claimed that a few student union leaders have given an open call for taking down the signboard. According to the complaint filed by ABVP, the members of ABVP are witnessing continuous assaults on symbols of national significance inside the JNU campus. In yet another sequence of the recurring defacement of statues and sign boards named on the personalities significant to our national identity and pride, the perpetrators seem to be persevering, without any respect for law and order. “It is a clear violation of the Defacement of Public Property Act, 2007... We appeal to the police administration to identify the perpetrators and take strict action against them, to ensure peace and decorum in the campus,” the complaint further stated. JNU Students'' Union (JNUSU) vice-president Saket Moon said the ABVP was trying to divert attention from the real issues faced by the varsity. “JNUSU has been demanding that the administration allow a phased return of students to campus and other issues like online registration for the upcoming semester. The ABVP is trying to divert attention from the real issues and are trying to shield the administration from being answerable on these issues,” he said. Objectionable messages, mostly directed towards right-wing outfits, were found written on the pedestal of a yet to be unveiled statue of Swami Vivekananda on the JNU campus last year in November following which the varsity administration had filed a police complaint.

“From September 12, 2020, we the students of GVC Dentam are going to start a series of activities to press for the immediate fulfillment of our demands. This will go until all our demands are fulfilled unconditionally,” said the students in a release issued in Gangtok on Tuesday.
The students regretted that despite several petitions to both the previous and present governments, nothing had been done to address their issues. “Despite receiving verbal assurances from chief minister downwards, there has been no progress on the ground. The students have been rendered helpless as a result of the total negligence on the part of the concerned department and the government,” the students alleged.

Punyaprasad Sharma, the principal of GVC Dentam, said the permanent campus spread over seven acres was coming up, but admitted to the delay in construction because of various factors, including disruptions caused by the pandemic.
“The construction was started in 2019. Plinth level work is going on,” he said, adding the Union ministry of human resource development had sanctioned Rs 26 crore for the project.
Sharma said since the new campus would take time to be completed, a proposal was mooted to shift the college to a bigger building owned by the government at Dentam. “But the proposal has been stalled because of the pandemic.”",states
Three new faces join Sikkim cricket," The Sikkim Cricket Association (SICA) has engaged pacer Anureet Singh, batsman Md. Shahbaz Anwar and all-rounder Robin Bist for the 2020-2021 domestic season, including the prestigious Ranji Trophy.
The troika replaces Iqbal Abdullah, Yashpal Singh and Ishwar Chaudhary, who had donned the Sikkim colours last season.
According to the rules of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), states can hire a maximum of three guest players in their teams. Sikkim would be participating in the senior level of domestic cricket for the third year running after the SICA was granted full membership of the BCCI in 2018. The highlanders have not exactly set the stadium on fire in the previous seasons, but have been competitive on occasions, particularly in the shorter formats of the game.
Among the three new signings, Anureet has the most impressive record, having taken 249 wickets in 72 matches at an economy rate of just 2.73, including 16 five-wicket hauls, in first-class cricket so far. He also scored 1,209 runs in first-class cricket and played for three teams in the IPL.
Former Rajasthan skipper Bist is a right-hand middle-order batsman and an off-break bowler. He has scored over 6,000 runs in first-class cricket with 15 centuries and 34 half-centuries. In List A matches, he has over 1,200 runs in his kitty with the highest score of 109 not out.
Anwar, who is from Bengal, is the youngest of the three and was part of the Sikkim under-23 team last season. He had a prolific year, scoring 1,130 runs in nine matches in the Col. C.K. Nayudu Trophy, including five centuries and six half-centuries. In the shorter format, he had scored 406 runs in 9 matches, including a century and two half-centuries. Anureet said he was excited to be part of the team and was looking forward to sharing his experience with his new mates and learning from them as well. “Cricket is such a sport where there is always new things to learn. It is a never-ending process,” he added.
Bist, on his part, said he would be bringing in his winning experience, having been part of two Ranji Trophy triumphs. “I am looking forward to the upcoming season and I want to give my best,” he added.
SICA president Lobzang G. Tenzing congratulated the selectors for bringing on board the three talented players. “SICA has signed some of the consistent performers in domestic cricket and we believe they will keep the momentum going,” he said.",states
"Woman drowned, search on for siblings in Sikkim"," Three siblings in their 20s from Kazitar Dikchu in East Sikkim were swept away in river Bakcha on Saturday.
Only the body of one of the sisters was recovered on Sunday after a massive search operation.

Sikkim body ups ante on hospitals," The Sikkim Progressive Youth Forum has threatened to take to the streets if the government fails to upgrade facilities at state hospitals and ensure free medicine and health services by November 30.
In a release issued on Monday, SPYF said the government had failed to deliver on the twin demands despite the assurance given to the forum by health minister Dr M.K. Sharma in February. ""We have no choice other than to issue an ultimatum to the government to fulfill the twopoint demands within Nov 30 2020, else, we will take to the streets,"" said the forum.
In February, the SPYF had submitted a memorandum to the minister along with 10,000 signatures of the public in support of its demands for upgrading facilities at government hospitals according to the Indian Public Health Standard (IPHS) guidelines and provision for free medical services and medicines to the people. ‘Dr Sharma had assured us that our demands would be fulfilled within two months of the budget session, but the condition of the hospitals continue to remain the same even after five months of the budget session,’ it regretted.
The SPYF said district hospitals apart, even the condition of primary health centres was in a pathetic state. “The condition of PHCs is so bad that people hardly go there. They are only there in name,” it alleged.
The SPYF has been spearheading the campaign to upgrade health facilities in the state for two-and-a-half years. Besides the signature campaign, it had held mass movements on three different occasions. The forum had also organised ‘Gangtok Chalo’ march from Geyzing in West Sikkim to Gangtok in January 2019 to highlight the abysmal condition of the Geyzing District Hospital.

Covid protocol breach case on duo in Sikkim," Sikkim police on Monday filed a case against two visiting technicians who tested positive for Covid-19 for allegedly violating the Covid-19 protocol and endangering the lives of others.
The duo were part of a five-member team from Calcutta and Delhi and visited Gangtok on August 6 for maintenance work at State Data Centre at the IT department’s invitation.
IT secretary Mrinalini Shrivastava sought special permission from the East Sikkim administration for the team’s entry. Granting permission, the district administration had stated that the team would have to undergo rapid antigen test at the entry point, and travel to their places of work and stay in an ambulance under police cover at all times.
During their week-plus stay, the team visited other places and met some MLAs, including Aditya Golay, son of chief minister P.S. Tamang (Golay), and bureaucrats at meetings facilitated by the IT department. Two team members tested positive on Sunday.
The police filed a case against the two under IPC sections for disobedience of public order and endangering lives of others, and for refusing to comply with the government directive under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
S. C. Gupta, the state’s chief secretary, sought an explanation from IT secretary Shrivastava on the issue.
Since some meetings took place at the Tashiling secretariat in Gangtok, the entire complex has been declared as a containment zone.
The incident created a furore in Sikkim with many wondering why the administration had not acted with same alacrity against politicians and bureaucrats as they did against the technician duo.",states
Don’t derail HIV combat: Forum," The Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum (SDUF) has expressed fears that HIV prevention activities may have taken a back seat in Sikkim because of an allegedly lax state health department amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Forum president Rinzing Bhutia said HIV prevention programme should not be derailed despite the prevailing Covid pandemic.
“An emerging public health crisis should not be the reason to derail the handling of an existing crisis,” she said.
Citing an example of the department’s alleged casual attitude, Bhutia said a counsellor attached to the oral substitute therapy (OST) centre at Jorethang Hospital and a technician at the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) at Namchi District Hospital were transferred over a year back, but their replacements had not yet arrived.
Even more perplexing is the fact that the two persons who had been transferred worked for the State AIDS Control Society under the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) of the Union health ministry, she said.

Bhutia added that the two persons who were transferred had been trained and experienced persons. Such transfers affect the continuity of effective HIV service deliveries, she said.
“Ideally, we would want the department to retransfer both to their original places of posting instead of giving replacements,” she added.
The SDUF president also said her organisation had written to Sikkim health minister M.K. Sharma on July 6 on the issue, but got no response.
“If there is no positive action on the issue, the health minister will be held accountable for any loss of life and the spread of new HIV infections in the state,” she warned.
Sources said Sikkim now has a little over 200 patients under antiretroviral therapy, or the HIV treatment regime.

AASU justifies erosion of faith in BJP leaders," Why does Assam have no faith in the BJP-led Centre despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public commitment to protect the identity of the Assamese people following the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?
This was the question posed by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) leadership before the thousands who had defied curfew to attend a massive protest meeting here against the “contentious and divisive” legislation which received presidential assent on Thursday.
AASU offered the answers. There are at least three reasons, according to the AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjya, which does not inspire confidence in the ruling dispensation.
He reminded the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo about the Centre’s serial U-turn over three issues — influx, land swap deal and big dams — despite public commitments.
“How can we believe in you? Why will the people of Assam believe you? There are three reasons we don’t trust you. You had promised before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls to send illegal Bangladeshis packing by May 16, 2014; secondly, you had promised not to include Assam land in the India-Bangladesh land swap deal. Thirdly, you were against big dams. But you did not fulfil the promises after coming to power. How can we believe you?”
AASU was referring to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweet on Thursday: “The Central Government and I are totally committed to constitutionally safeguard the political, linguistic, cultural and land rights of the Assamese people as per the spirit of Clause 6. I want to assure my brothers and sisters of Assam that they have nothing to worry after the passing of #CAB. I want to assure them no one can take away your rights, unique identity and beautiful culture. It will continue to flourish and grow.”
The land swap deal was signed by Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina in June 2015 despite the party protesting against the deal during the UPA II regime. The Centre is now trying to resume construction 2000MW Lower Subansiri hydel project, stalled since 2011, AASU general secretary Lurin Jyoti Gogoi said.
The AASU leadership made it clear at the meeting that they will not rest till the legislation was scrapped, given their past experience with the ruling BJP. “We want the law scrapped. We will continue to fight peacefully on the streets and in the courts since you not cared for the sentiments of the Assamese people,” he said.
Anti-CAB protesters fear the new legislation will pose a threat to the culture, identity and language of the Assamese people if the Centre rolls out the “red carpet” to welcome Bangladeshi Hindus, one of the communities which will benefit from the bill.
“You had promised to send illegal Bangladeshi back but now you are getting ready to welcome them through the CAB. You gave away our land to Bangladersh and are now backing big dams! That is why we want the CAB scrapped,” Bhattacharya said to thunderous applause.",states
Bangladesh demands security for envoys," Bangladesh on Thursday summoned the Indian high commissioner Riva Ganguly Das to register its protest over the attack on its diplomat posted in Guwahati and the chancery.
Dhaka has also demanded additional security for its missions in India in the wake of the escalating protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Acting foreign secretary Kamrul Hasan summoned Das to the foreign office to protest about the attack on the convoy of assistant high commissioner Shah Mohammad Tanvir Mansur in Guwahati and the vandalisation of signposts near the chancery.
Mansur’s convoy was attacked by protesters on Wednesday, when he was returning from the airport.
On Thursday, protesters tore down two signposts of the mission.

Celebrities keep the momentum going," Celebrities, including singers and actors, turned up for a hunger strike and demonstration organised by the All Assam Students Association (AASU) for the second day on Friday.
Popular singers Zubeen Garg and Zublee Baruah, and actors Barasha Rani Bishaya, Utpal Das and Rabi Sarma, apart from others, participated in a demonstration as part of the 10-hour hunger strike organised by AASU at Assam Engineering Institute field, Chandmari.
Many celebrities had earlier joined the protest at Latasil field on Thursday, breaking curfew and speaking out against the central government’s decision to impose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Zubeen was greeted with cheers and applause when it was his turn to speak on the temporary platform at the protest. The popular singer and actor has been very vocal against the law and has been spearheading the protests along with the AASU leaders. “I am totally against the citizenship law. I have no caste, no religion, no god but only Assam (referring to his dialogue in his latest movie Kanchenjungha). There have been violence and deaths. We did not start the struggle for that. Some people are trying to lend a different colour to it. Please remain alert. We must not back down. There is a long struggle ahead. Our struggle is not against any community or religion. Our dream is to create a golden Assam,” he said.
Zubeen hummed his song Politics Nokoriba Bondhu (shun politics, my friend) while announcing that a protest with music has been planned for 11am on Sunday at the same venue. Das was emotional while delivering his speech, saying, “I asked my father about his experience during the Assam Agitation but he did not live here at that time. I am unlucky not to have first-hand knowledge but I am making sure that my daughter can feel it. I am teaching my three-year-old daughter to say Joi Aai Axom at a time when she can barely say aai. I am emotional but my emotion is not my weakness, it is my strength.”

"Walking home, prayer on lips"," It was an eerie experience moving around Guwahati for the last two days covering protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. The streets were literally on fire. Shops were closed. Most of the people were heading to the protest grounds — Latasil on Thursday and Chandmari on Friday.
I had never, in my entire life, experienced such a feeling. Everywhere there were groups of protesters, some peaceful, others aggressive.
Having heard that protesters were gathering at Latasil in defiance of curfew, I moved towards the venue. The atmosphere was charged. There was no public transport available and torching of a few vehicles on Wednesday evening had made me leave my own behind. As soon as I reached the RBI Point, I saw students barricading the road with branches and other objects. A two-wheeler was forced to turn back.
The city resembled a battle zone, with streets scarred by burnt tyres, railings torn and twisted and signposts uprooted. The curfew had forced people to remain indoors and the announcement by police cars only added to the paranoia.
Around noon, groups of people shouting slogans like ‘We don’t want CAB, BJP go back, Joi Aai Axom (glory to our motherland), Aah oi aah ulai aah (come out, one and all)’ started pouring into the area. Soon, thousands gathered there in a spontaneous gesture. The curfew seemed non-existent. The speeches by AASU leaders and celebrities, imploring a restrained but continued movement, seemed to have worked their magic. By evening, the feeling was cruelly crushed as reports of police firing and death of three young protesters spread.

The walk back home was nerve-wracking. The streets were dark and deserted, except for police personnel at major points. I felt blessed on reaching home safely.
Friday was a little better as people thronged the open shops to stock up on groceries and other essentials, despite the curfew. Shops ran out of stock and overcharged the buyers. Everyone seemed apprehensive and groups of people gathered to discuss the latest news and rumours. A few vehicles ventured out but it was better to walk or hire a rickshaw. Staying safe is the best policy, I thought, as I made my way to Chandmari.
AASU leaders gathered at the AEI field for a hunger strike. Fiery speeches blaming the state government for the situation and impassioned calls for a peaceful but continuous protest were made by student leaders, prominent citizens and celebrities. AASU has called for suspension of evening protests for a week, in a bid to thwart trouble-makers. I walked back home through dark, deserted streets with a prayer on my lips for the second day running.",states
Guns & goons in Jamshedpur heart," Police on Friday arrested Sheikh Noman, 20, who along with his bike-borne associates allegedly fired seven rounds in the air at Golmuri Muslim Bustee around 10pm on Thursday, an hour after a resident objected to the assembly of goons from other localities.
“When Mohammed Mushir objected to the gathering of unwanted elements in front of his house, Noman and other miscreants had threatened Mushir and abused him before leaving the place in a huff. But the bike-borne miscreants returned to the spot an hour later and one of them fired in the air,” said Niyaz Hussain, a locality resident.
Police sources said the suspects include Golmuri Hindu Bustee resident Sadab Khan, 23, Sakchi resident Mohammed Arju, 22, and another 22-year-old man whose identity was yet to be established.
'Due to gathering of goons from outside the locality, residents especially women and girls find it difficult to even walk on the street,” said Mushir, 27. He vowed to protest the gathering of goons in the locality regardless of the consequences.
A police party had rushed to the spot soon after getting information about the firing; but the goons had fled the spot by then. “We have recovered four empty cartridges of 7.65mm from the spot, but local residents claimed the goons had fired seven rounds,” said Ranvijay Sharma the Golmuri police station officer in-charge.

"A tale of fire, fumes & despair"," As the election focus shifts to the coal belt, Rajendra Paswan, 48, a private tutor and a resident of underground fire-hit Mohribandh locality in Jharia, couldn’t care less.
“Being an educated, responsible citizen, I will exercise my voting right on December 16, but it will change nothing for more than 1 lakh families, including mine, living in the 595 fire-affected areas under continuous fear of subsidence and inhaling toxic fumes billowing out of the cracks in the ground,” Paswan said.
Paswan, who had enjoyed a happy childhood breathing fresh air and enjoying the greenery in Mohribandh, around 11km from the district headquarters, finds it disturbing that his six children are being exposed to coal dust and toxic gases.
He said deteriorating air quality in the area was taking a heavy toll on the residents.
“We live in the shadow of death. Pollution has reached alarming levels. Private firms carry out rampant mining by violating all environment norms,” he said.

He cited the example of Ram Kumar Paswan, a Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) employee and a neighbour, who died of tuberculosis two years ago after being exposed to pollution both at the mining site and at home.
“Another resident of our area, Umesh Bhuia, died at the age 28 last year due to breathing-related complications,” Paswan added.
In a bid to complete coal excavation within a stipulated deadline, the private companies engaged by BCCL are not paying heed to basic guidelines like sprinkling water to control dust, Paswan said.
He said ensuring quality education for his children had become a far-fetched dream.
“I am a science graduate from RSP College in Jharia, considered one of best colleges of the state back then. One of my daughters has completed her graduation in commerce from the same college. But the shifting of the college from Jharia to Belgarhia has throttled her dreams of pursuing higher education. She is forced to sit idle at home,” Paswan said.
He said the college had been relocated to an isolated area cut off from all modes of communication.
“Even auto-rickshaws refuse to go. Students have to walk through a deserted stretch before they can reach the auto stand. Girls feel very unsafe. I couldn’t risk my daughter’s security,” he said.
Paswan said he was equally concerned about the higher education of his third daughter, a student of Class XII in a CBSE-affiliated English medium school.
Paswan’s eldest son, who stopped studying after Class XII, works as a supervisor in a private firm in Kerala, while the eldest among his daughters is married. His second son is an apprentice in BCCL and the third son is a CRPF jawan posted in Ranchi.
Questioning the rationale behind shifting of the RSP College, Paswan said: “The college was relocated because it fell in the subsidence-prone zone. If it is true, then how come the Jharia-Dhanbad main road adjacent to the college’s boundary wall was widened at a cost of Rs 44.83 crore by the road construction department?”
He said he was finding it difficult to get his two employed sons married because parents of the girls were not willing to let their daughters marry a person living in such conditions.

The statewide 24-hour strike, called by the Tripura PCC and the Tripura
Pradesh Youth Congress, in protest against baton charge by police on Citizenship (Amendment) Bill agitators here on Wednesday had a partial impact across the city on Thursday.
In a related development, the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT), the Joint Movement Against Citizenship Amendment Bill (JMACAB) and royal scion Pradyot Kishore Manikya Deb Burman separately met Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Thursday and urged him to scrap the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the state.
The JMACAB is a joint forum of different tribal political parties and civil society organisations.
Its leaders decided to call off their protest against the CAB for the time being on Wednesday after chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb had assured them that he would arrange a meeting with Shah.
The chief of the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (INPT), a part of the JMACAB, Bijoy Kumar Hrangkhawl, said: “We met Shah today and discussed the CAB which has already been passed in both Houses of Parliament. Voicing our concern, we told him that the bill could lead to loss of our identity and rights. He assured us of all possible help.”
A delegation, led by the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT), an ally of the ruling BJP in the state, also met Shah on Thursday and demanded implementation of ‘Tipraland’ — a separate state of indigenous people living in Tripura — and scraping of the CAB.
“The delegation of eight teams, led by us, met Shah. We raised the issues of CAB and ‘Tipraland’. We told him that the CAB has already been implemented in the state and we will become minorities in Tripura. He said he would protect our culture and identity and told us not to worry. Most probably he will call us again after 15 days,” forest minister and IPFT general secretary Mevar Kumar Jamatia told this correspondent.
Pradyot said during his meeting with Shah, he told him that the CAB cannot be implemented in Tripura as it violates the Instrument of Accession.
“We told him: ‘If you do that we will move the Supreme Court.’ I said a state like Tripura which shares border with Bangladesh, has not been exempted from the bill, but Mizoram, Manipur and other states who do not have international boundaries are out of the purview of the bill. However, Shah told me that he would look into the matter,” Pradyot said.
On Thursday Shah tweeted: “Met with delegations of IPFT and Joint Movement Against CAB from Tripura and discussed their concerns over CAB. Modi government will try to solve their issues in a positive way. I thank them for their appeal to maintain peace and call off the strike.”
He also wrote: “Had a meeting with Shri Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman, head of Manikya dynasty, the royal family of Tripura and Patal Kanya Jamatia, President of TPF (Tripura People’s Front).”",states
"Mizoram CM backs protests, bandh against Citizenship Bill"," Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga on Monday said the state government is strongly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, and extended support to Tuesday’s bandh in the Northeast called by the North East Students’ Organisation (Neso) in protest against the Centre’s bid to pass the bill in Parliament.
Addressing an inaugural programme of the party office here on Monday, Zoramthanga said the Mizo National Front (MNF) had been opposing the bill from the very beginning. He said the bill is an attempt to make illegal migrants eligible for Indian citizenship on the basis of religion.
The bill, Zoramthanga alleged, was against the principle of secularism and if passed, would be “harmful” to states like Mizoram where there is a large number of illegal Buddhist migrants from Bangladesh.
“We extend support to Neso and its members including the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) for calling a 12-hour strike in the Northeast on Tuesday to protest against the Centre decision to get the bill passed in Parliament,” he said.
The Young Mizo Association (YMA), Mizoram’s largest civil society organisation, also extended support to the MZP on the statewide total shutdown on Tuesday to protest against the bill. A statement issued by the organisation said it had strongly opposed the proposed bill “which seeks to grant citizenship to many foreigners”.
The organization also said it had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Rajnath Singh informing them of its strong opposition to the bill.
CM’s claim: Zoramthanga said Socio-Economic Development Policy, the state’s flagship programme, would be implemented to cover every citizen.
He said ownership and transfer of land would also be implemented properly in accordance with the Mizo Peace Accord and power conferred by the Centre. Zoramthanga said that his government was acting swiftly to fulfil its poll promises.
He said his government had closed nine liquor shops run by government agencies and declared days between December 21, 2018 and January 14, 2019 as “dry days” to impose total prohibition.
As for privately run liquor shops, he said a legislation had to be passed in the Assembly and the state government would extend the period of dry days if necessary.
Zoramthanga that his government had also begun road repairs across the state.
He said his government would take massive effort to usher in speedier development.",states
Amnesia pills for Jharia MLA accused in 2017 murder case," Jharia MLA Sanjeev Singh, the prime accused in the 2017 murder of his cousin and Congress leader Niraj Singh, was examined for amnesia (loss of memory) at Ranchi Institute of Neuropsychiatry and Allied Sciences (Rinpas) on Monday.
The court of a Dhanbad additional district judge had on January 5 directed the BJP MLA’s treatment at Rinpas after divisional jail doctors found him medically unfit.
Sanjeev, behind bars since his arrest on April 11, 2017, was brought 150km to the mental health institute in Kanke, near the capital, around 1.15pm amid tight security and in a bulletproof car. He was examined by a panel of three doctors till 4.45pm before being escorted back to jail.
A Rinpas insider said the MLA underwent a series of tests to ascertain the degree of memory loss, if any.
“Sanjeev Singh was brought here following complaints of amnesia, besides insomnia, restlessness and loss of appetite. Three doctors examined him and he underwent tests. He didn’t require admission and was only prescribed medication,” the source said. Rinpas superintendent P.K. Sinha confirmed that the MLA was examined by doctors at the institute, but refused to share details. “Patient information is confidential. We are under oath not to divulge anything,” he said.
Sanjeev’s lawyer Mohammed Javed said they were glad the court had heard their petition to send the MLA “to a higher centre” for medical treatment. “We had submitted a petition on January 3 and the court on January 5 ordered his transfer to Rinpas. He was examined at Rinpas and is expected back in the coal town by late evening,” Javed said.
Former Dhanbad deputy mayor Niraj Singh, along with his four aides, was shot dead in Saraidhela on March 21, 2017.
Arrested on April 11, 2017, the MLA was shifted to Birsa Munda Central Jail in Ranchi a week later on the order of then IG (prisons) Suman Gupta for security reasons. He was brought back to Dhanbad divisional jail on February 28, 2018, following a high court order.
Dhanbad police had submitted charge sheets against 11 accused last year and on January 4, framed charges against six including Sanjeev.",states
NRC here to stay: Rajnath," Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday claimed that the BJP would form a majority government in Jharkhand.
Singh, addressing a public meeting at K.B. High school ground in Dumri, said the BJP had people’s support as it fulfilled its promises, such as abrogating Article 370, making triple talaq punishable under law, and announcing a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya following the Supreme Court verdict.
On the Opposition’s criticism on the NRC, Singh said: “Is it not our responsibility to identify infiltrators in the country? We will neither accept them as Indian nationals nor grant them citizenship.” He asserted the NRC would be implemented across India.
He said the Raghubar Das government in Jharkhand “changed the image and fate of the state in the last five years by providing a stable and corruption free government.”
“This election is not about an individual, not to make anybody MLA or minister, this election is to change the fate of Jharkhand. You have to elect the party which can fulfill goals,” Singh said. “While (BJP) Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee created Jharkhand, (BJP) Prime Minister Narendra Modi nourished it.”
Slamming the JMM, he said it neglected the plight of tribals. Urging people to vote BJP candidate from Dumri Pradeep Kumar Sahu into power, he also spoke of the BJP’s achievements in giving people homes, gas connections and health schemes.",states

Trinamul ups ante on citizen bill," The Trinamul Congress has launched its campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in north Bengal by organising a meeting in Malda and taking out processions across the region.
Around 3,000 Trinamul supporters on Thursday attended the meeting near the district collectorate in Malda where tourism minister Gautam Deb and former MP Mausam Benazir Noor renewed the vow to oppose the CAB and the National Register of Citizens in Bengal.
“People across north Bengal, particularly those living closer to the Assam border, fear the NRC and the CAB. We want to reiterate that our government and party will not let the BJP take up any of these exercises in the state. We want people to be aware of the consequences they might face. I will visit districts like Alipurduar and Cooch Behar and speak to people to ease their feeling of insecurity,” said Deb.
Noor, who is also the Malda district Trinamul chief, sounded confident of reviving the party’s support base.
“The turnout at the meeting exceeded our expectations. This shows people have realised how the BJP has plunged them into uncertainty and that we were correct in highlighting the problems they might face if the NRC or the CAB is implemented in Bengal. We need to get more and more people in support of our stand,” said Noor.

Trinamul held marches at several places in north Bengal against the CAB and the NRC, especially at places with sizeable population of minorities and located close to the Bangladesh border.
The BJP had won seven out of eight Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal in the recent election. Trinamul leaders said although they had tried to revive the party’s suppose base in north Bengal after the polls, it didn’t work much.
However, after the final list of the NRC was published in Assam, the BJP had to face awkward questions from people in most districts of the region.
This was because of two reasons. “First, many people who are from north Bengal but stay in Assam could not find their names in the final list which left their family members worried. Secondly, consistent ranting by state BJP leaders that the NRC and the CAB will be implemented in Bengal disappointed a large section of people,” said an observer.
With 20 civic bodies going to polls in north Bengal next year, Trinamul has projected itself as the sole crusader against the CAB and the NRC. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee repeatedly vowed that both the exercises would not be allowed in Bengal as long as Trinamul was in power in the state. ",states
Sweet eats & soulful songs," Capital residents who couldn’t attend the famous Poush Mela at Santinekatan in Bengal can look forward to having a feel of it here itself.
Majlish, a socio-cultural organisation of Bengali speaking employees of Mecon and Ranchi-based SAIL units, will organise a three-day Poush Mela at Mecon Community Hall from January 11 to 13.
Coal town, on the other hand, had its first brush with Poush Mela. The two-day festival, organised by Lindsay Club at its auditorium in Dhanbad on January 5-6, got an overwhelming response.
In Ranchi, the mela may not match the scale of the over 100-year-old fair in Bengal, but captures its essence well.
“We’ll bring in a Baul group and a troupe of Santhali dancers from Birbhum in Bengal,” said Golap Mohammad Choudhury, cultural secretary of Majlish.

Guest artistes from Calcutta will sing Bengali folk songs.
While Anil Das and his group will present Baul songs, a 14-member troupe led by Dolan Mahali will perform Santhali dance. Raj Kumar Roy and Amit Pahari will regale the audience with folk songs. Members and their kin can take part in song, dance and fancy dress competitions.
Choudhury said around 20 stalls would be put up at the mela site. They will sell boutique items and apparel from Santiniketan, knick-knacks and food items.
“We will also organise an art exhibition at the fair to display works of art by local artists,” the cultural secretary of Majlish said.
In Dhanbad, over 9,000 people visited the fair and enjoyed mouth-watering dishes served by 13 food stalls. “The footfall has surpassed our expectation,” fest coordinator Shuvashish Paul said.
Such was the rush, that a majority of stalls ran out of food on the first day.
“Most stalls were put up by club members. Therefore, the quality of food was very good. The dishes were also affordable,” Paul said.
He said bauls from Bankura and Naihati in Bengal were the major attractions.
Suman Banerjee, who owns an electronics shop at Vinod Market in Hirapur, said, “The fest gave Dhanbad residents the opportunity to enjoy some traditional Bengali dishes.”
Chandan Daibagna, a food stall owner, the demand for fish cutlet and fish Fry was so high that they went out of stock within the first three hours itself.
“I sold items worth Rs 16,000 during the inaugural day,” he added.",states
Gogoi dubs Sonowal ‘spineless’ over Citizenship bill," Former chief minister and Congress leader Tarun Gogoi on Sunday again hit out at Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, describing him as “spineless” and a “duplicate jatiyo nayok (national hero)”.
The day also witnessed a group of women protesting in front of the BJP’s state head office here, accusing Sonowal of hoodwinking the people in the name of protecting “jati, mati, bheti”.
“I have never seen such a power hungry chief minister. His concern is his chair, not the people. He is a spineless chief minister,” Gogoi said.
Sonowal had reiterated that his government was committed to safeguard the interests of all local communities on Saturday.
On the previous day, he had been seen clapping at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in a meeting in Silchar that he hoped that the bill would be passed in Parliament soon.

“Sonowal talks about safeguarding the indigenous people. How will he do that? By passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016? On Friday he clapped at Modi’s announcement. After supporting the bill, whose safeguard he is talking about?” Gogoi asked.
“Now it has been proved that Sonowal is a duplicate jatiyo nayok. He is a puppet chief minister who dances as has been asked to dance,” he said. Assam PCC president Ripun Bora on Sunday said the decision to pass the bill was nothing but a historic injustice to the people of the region, adds our correspondent from Tezpur.
The senior Congress leader addressed a press conference at a circuit house and said the party will stage a series of agitations called Jagaw Assam-Basaw Assam to mobilise the common people against the bill. He added that they would also stage a protest outside Parliament on Monday.
“It is a total dishonour shown to the people of Assam, as despite strong protests from all fronts, the Prime Minister is going to pass it,” he added.
Bora also criticised the AGP and said the regional party of the state was betraying the soul of the 850 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the self-determination of the people of Assam.",states
Rahul hurls onion barb," Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in two rallies at Rajmahal and Mahagama in tribal heartland Santhal Pargana on Thursday, described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as someone who was turning India into a scared nation where people are weak and divided.
At both rallies, the crowd was nearly 9,000, which political watchers in Santhal Pargana said was a fair figure, given the geographical terrain and the organisation strength of today’s Congress.
Rahul urged people to vote for Congress candidates Kutubuddin Sheikh (Rajmahal) and Deepika Pandey Singh (Mahagama), and elect the Opposition alliance of the JMM-Congress-RJD to power.
At the first rally at Charwaha grounds, Rajmahal, Rahul promised to waive off farmer loans up to Rs 2 lakh if the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance was elected to power in Jharkhand. “The Congress governments in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh procure paddy at Rs 2,500 per quital. Farmers in Jharkhand will also get the same rate if we win the election,” he said.
He alleged that Modi became the Prime Minister to divide the nation and people on the lines of caste and religion and that the PM did not realise how people were suffering due to inflation.

“Why doesn’t he say in his speeches that the price of onions is Rs 200 per kilo,” he asked. “Only the PM is unaware of inflation because he lives in some other world. Only his 15 to 20 industrialists friends like Adani are happy. Modi waives off their loans and fleeces money from people to pay them. Some five years ago he became PM and announced a fight against black money. He announced demonetisation and robbed the poor, the farmers and the masses.”
After the rally at Rajmahal, Rahul flew to Mahagama where he addressed a rally at Barbadda High School grounds. Here, he raised the problem of drinking water. “Do you have a hand-pump in your village? Does it work? Do you get pure water?” he asked the crowd.
When many answered no, he said: “Can you imagine that in the 21st century you don’t have even basic facilities like water? Do you know why? Modi diverts money for public welfare to the pockets of industrialists. Mobile telephone services have become costly. But before increasing the tariff of mobile phone services, Modi gave Rs 60,000 crore to telephone companies. Modi talks about the moon and rockets but he won’t ensure water for you. Of course Adani enjoys mineral water,” he said.
Rahul alleged the Jharkhand government had formed a land bank to grab the land of tribals and farmers. “Open any news channel and you will see Modi. You will neither find me nor Hemant Soren because media houses are owned by those Modi works for,” he said.",states
"Aged lady stabbed 24 times, head severed"," A 65-year-old woman was found murdered with around two dozen stab wounds on her abdomen and chest and her head severed in the house of her youngest son where she had been staying alone for a few days.
Police said Urmila Devi was found lying on a bed in the ground-floor apartment in Garcha First Lane, a stone’s throw from Hazra Main Road and Dover Terrace.
The owner of the two-storey building lives on the first floor.
The apartment’s door was open when the family’s domestic help Lakshmi turned up around 10am. She was apparently the first to spot the body.
“Urmila’s legs were dangling. Clothes from a chest of drawers were strewn all over the room,” a neighbour said.

Officers suspect the woman had been dead when her head was severed.
“The motive is not clear. A preliminary investigation suggests her head was severed and a deep slash wound was made on her abdomen after her death. The post-mortem report will reveal the cause of death but apparently it looks like the 24-odd stab wounds on her chest and abdomen were enough to kill her,” said joint commissioner of police, crime, Murlidhar Sharma.
Another officer said this could be a murder for revenge.
Urmila’s mobile phone, gold earrings, gold bangles and gold chain were intact.
The police questioned the man who would visit the apartment around 6am every day to supply water.
Urmila’s family, originally from Punjab, has been staying in Calcutta for years. The police said the family ran several businesses.
The woman, a widow, had been staying in the rented house of youngest son Balraj Kumar over the past three days. Neighbours said she was alone because Balraj and his family had gone to Cooch Behar to attend a marriage.
Urmila used to spend most of her time at her ancestral house in Punjab. When in Calcutta, she would mostly stay with the widow and teenage daughters of her eldest son Mandeep at their Ritchie Road house. Urmila’s second son Deepak lives with his family in Siliguri.
“She was staying here (in Balraj’s house) to guard the empty house. Last night, her eldest son’s daughters brought her dinner around 10.30pm,” said a neighbour.
Investigators said one of the neighbours told them that he had heard Urmila cry out the name of one of the granddaughters around 12.30am, after which there was a sound of a door slamming shut.
“Going by the neighbour’s account and the state of rigor mortis, we suspect the victim was killed between midnight and 4am,” the officer said.
The police said there were no marks of breaking the door, suggesting the assailant either found the door open or was allowed to come inside.
“Usually my mother would lock the doors by 10pm and open them again around 6am. Since she was alone she might have been retiring early,” Balraj told Metro over the phone while returning to Calcutta on Thursday evening.
Urmila’s husband had rented the Garcha First Lane house decades ago. Balraj has been staying in the house with his family since his father’s death.
Neighbour and friend Goutam Chanda said Urmila was a “strong woman” and would often walk to the nearby gurudwara. “I saw her day before yesterday. She was with her granddaughter. She said she was going to the market,” said Chanda.
Some neighbours said a liquor shop in the neighbourhood — its gate is very close to Balraj’s house — was a constant source of trouble.
“This place has become unsafe because of that (liquor) shop. Drunken brawls have become common in this neighbourhood. We had sought help from Gariahat police station but no action has been taken,” said a resident. “We will meet the residents soon and discuss how security can be improved,” said an officer of the police station.",states
Manipur honours its brave mothers," On the occasion of Nupi Lan Day (women’s war) at Nupi Lan Memorial Complex here on Thursday, the Manipur government paid rich tributes to the brave mothers of the state who fought against the British forces.
Manipur’s women had risen in agitation against the British regime to protest the mass exploitation and artificial famine in 1904 and 1939. The agitation later evolved as a movement for the constitutional and administrative reform of the erstwhile kingdom of Manipur.
Participating on the occasion, chief minister N. Biren Singh on Thursday assured the gathered audience that the government was fully committed to uphold the dignity and honour of women.
He said the state government has established fast-track courts to deal with crimes against women to deliver speedy justice.
Special women cells have also been opened in all the police stations in the state, he said. Biren Singh said, “It is indeed a matter of pride that many Manipuri women are at the forefront in various fields in the country.”

He said Manipur topped in women ownership of micro, small and medium enterprise businesses in the country.
Manipur women owned 50 per cent of the MSME businesses when compared to the national figure which is about 20 to 30 per cent.
He said there is a need for another Nupi Lan to fight against various problems prevailing in society such as the drug menace and alcoholism.
Deputy chief minister Y. Joykumar Singh, who was also present, stressed on the courage of the mothers who fought against the British and added that “we must not forget their supreme sacrifice”.
Later, a play based on Nupi Lan was staged by joint artistes of the Nupi Lan Memorial Association and Nupi Lal and Khongjom War Memorial Society to mark the occasion.",states

The police said they started attacking shops all of a sudden at Motphran. They ran towards Umsohsun and torched a vehicle parked in front of Hanumanbux Motilal Merchant Shop around 3pm.
They hurled petrol bombs at a vehicle (ML05-N-6001) belonging to the owner of the shop. The fire was doused by a fire tender.

Swing between hope & despair," Subhash Barman, 43, was not sure how to react. Having lived his entire life as a refugee, the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill kindled hope of a permanent refuge but fear looms large as protests against the bill are spreading like an epidemic in the state.
Barman is one of the 274 odd Hindu refugee families from erstwhile East Pakistan, settled at Choudhurypara in Bangaon in Kamrup district of Assam in the late 1960s, who were hopeful of getting Indian citizenship after the bill was passed.
Barman was not even born when his father fled to Assam in 1968 from Durgapur area of Mymensingh district of erstwhile East Pakistan after communal riots broke out in the neighbouring country.
Like Barman, the descendants of the 274 families, who now number about 2,000, were left out of the final National Register of Citizens (NRC). Mostly belonging to the Koch Rajbongshi, Hajong and Garo communities, this bunch of Hindu refugee families had applied for inclusion in the NRC but the lone document with them — refugee certificates — were allegedly not accepted by the NRC authorities.
“The question of our identity has become the biggest nightmare now. My father migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan. I was born here in a refugee camp and brought up with the local kids. Our family received land allotments in the late 1980s. With our names stripped off the NRC list, CAB was the lone resort for us. But with protests escalating over the passing of the bill, we are unsure of our future,” Barman said.

Refugee certificates had been issued to them by the then ministry of rehabilitation. The certificates, now faded and brittle, read that they had arrived in Indian due to religious persecution and without any identity documents between 1964 and 1968.
Sushil Das, who still lives in the refugee camp Barman was born in, said, “After living in a refugee camp (Bamunigaon Permanent Liability Home) for a couple of years, the state government allotted small pieces of land to each family. After living here for over half a century and at least two generations later, we don’t consider ourselves to be outsiders. Moreover, our families also reached here before the cut-off date of March 25, 1971. But what’s going to happen to us? We don’t have money for a lengthy and costly legal battle.”
Many families had used the allotted land for cultivation and stayed at the camp.
The ruling BJP said the government had brought in the bill, looking at the crisis of these people. “All these people need to apply for citizenship according to the guidelines set under CAB. If they manage to prove that they fled Bangladesh because of religious persecution or in fear of religious persecution, their application will be assessed before they are granted citizenship,” said BJP spokesperson Rupam Bhuyan.
He said unlike people’s apprehension that hundreds of Hindu Bengalis would enter Assam after the bill is passed, the persecuted Hindu Bengalis are already living in the country.
A BJP internal survey revealed that out of the 19 lakh people who were left out of the final NRC published on August 31, 5,04,800 were Bengali Hindus.
On Monday, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, while advocating the bill in a public function, had said, “There are propaganda and rumours being spread over CAB. No one will enter India from Bangladesh and the bill will enable only some five lakh people to apply for citizenship.”
Sources said the BJP is planning to complete the process of giving citizenship to them before the 2021 Assembly elections.",states
A dirt track too far from democracy," It was not the Maoist diktat but anger against the administration’s decision to relocate polling booths that made most Hesakocha villagers skip voting on Thursday, the third phase of the state elections.

Both these booths had been relocated near Utkramit Madhya Vidyalaya, Palna, over 13km from Hesakocha.
Asked why only 11 persons voted, gram pradhan Karna Singh Sardar, 46, pleaded helplessness. “Till 2014 Hesakocha residents voted at the Nav Prathmik Vidyalaya that was a 1.5km walk. This year, during Parliamentary polls, the administration located booths to Palna, citing security reasons,” he said. “Even in the height around 40 per cent villagers trudged all the way in the height of summer and voted, but we expected the administration to reconsider its decision by Vidhan Sabha polls. But no, the administration again set up booths at Palna, over 13km from our village, with no public transport and horrible mud roads. So most villagers this time decided against voting.”

Speaking to The Telegraph around noon, he admitted he hadn’t voted too.  CPI(Maoist) posters for “vote boycott to protest police oppression and killing of innocents” are pasted along the walls of thatched huts in the village. But villagers told The Telegraph that their decision had nothing to do with the Maoist diktat.
The gram pradhan admitted that Maoists pasted the posters on Wednesday night and even announced over microphones asking villagers to abstain from voting. “We can’t prevent them from pasting posters. Police seldom come to our village due to bad roads. There is no security. But still, Maoists had no hand in our not going to the polling booths. In 2014 too, Maoists had given a vote-boycott call. But people, including women, had voted then as the polling booth was near,” he said.
Hesakocha forest is used by rebel outfits, including the current area commander Maharaj Pramanik, to move between Chandil-Chowka and Tamar. In 2014, Maoists had beheaded a man from here that they believed was a police informer. They also torched several earthmovers for road construction in 2016 and 2017.
Madi Munda, 43, a farmer of Hesakocha who was one of the rare ones to vote, said he cycled all 13km of the dirt track that passes for a road. “Apni dekhchen road ki rokom achhey (See the state of the road),” he said in the Raarh Bangla dialect used by people here, adding it took him one hour to cycle to the booth and would take him more time to cycle back. “I am tired,” he said. “There’s virtually no road. That’s why no vehicles run. If one wants to walk, it can take three hours, one way. Who will come to vote taking so much trouble? That too during harvest time?”
Seraikela-Kharsawan DC Anjaneyulu Dodde admitted it was inconvenient. “We are aware of poor voting at the two polling booths. We relocated the booths due to security reasons. I will have to check with local officials if they arranged any transport for villagers on voting day today (Thursday),” said Dodde, also the district electoral officer for Ichagarh Assembly seat.",states

"BJP lied on granting scheduled tribe tag, says Morcha chief"," Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Binay Tamang on Saturday accused BJP leaders and his rival Bimal Gurung of “lying” on recognising 11 Darjeeling hill groups as Scheduled Tribes, waving a purported email on a central team’s visit next week.
Tamang cited the email and said it showed the Union tribal affairs ministry would send a committee to Gangtok on Monday to look into similar demands from groups in Sikkim.
The email’s disclosure comes two days after Roshan Giri, a confidant of former Morcha chief Gurung, posted a video of a purported interaction between some leaders of his faction and Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram.
The Union cabinet had on Wednesday approved an amendment bill to recognise some groups in Arunachal Pradesh as STs. There was no mention in the bill of demands for tribal status by the groups in Darjeeling, supported by the Bengal government and all hill parties.
In the clip released on Thursday, Oram is heard saying that if the “Bharat Sarkar” wants, the hill groups can be granted tribal status “overnight”. The purported statement had come amid Parliament’s winter session that ends on January 8.
On Saturday, Tamang cited the email and said: “They talk about passing the bill in the winter session whereas the committee hasn’t even completed its work.”
Tamang warned that “this lie” would cause “the political death of the BJP”. “This lie will cause the political death of BJP, Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri. They must explain why they served lies to the hill people on such an important issue.”
The purported email was sent on Thursday, the same day the video of Oram meeting Gurung faction leaders, along with Darjeeling BJP MP S.S. Ahluwalia, was circulated.
In September last year, Tamang had cited an RTI reply which indicated the Registrar-General of India had twice rejected the Bengal government’s recommendation to grant ST status to the 11 hill groups. ",states
Triangular fight between crorepatis," “Is baar koi Modi lahar nahi hai yahan. Is baar teen logon ke beech siddhi ladayi hai (No Modi wave here this time. Hazaribagh is witnessing a three cornered war on local issues).”
This nugget of political wisdom comes from Banshi Lal, a jhaalmuri (spicy puffed rice) seller of Hurhuru mohalla that falls in Hazaribagh constituency.
The prestigious Assembly seat under Hazaribagh Lok Sabha seat that votes on Thursday is locked in a direct fight between sitting MLA and BJP candidate Manish Jaiswal, Congress’s R.C. Prasad and JVM nominee Munna Singh.
An industrialist, with investments scattered in the education sector, Jaiswal is one of the richest candidates this Assembly elections with declared assets of around Rs 27.04 crore. But he’s up against four more crorepatis in fray, JVM’s Singh with Rs 19.15 crore, Congressman Prasad with Rs 10.64 crore, Lok Janshakti Party’s Mukesh Kumar with Rs 10.83 crore and AIMIM’s Nadeem Khan with Rs 1.21 crore.
Jaiswal, who shifted to the BJP from the JVM in 2013 and won the 2014 Assembly polls piggybacking on the Modi wave, is confident of his victory this time too.
“Maine neta nahin, beta bankar kaam kiya hai,” he says with folded hands during meetings and rallies, as he speaks about “roads connecting villages to the town, sanctioning the ambitious Konar drinking water project in the town”.
But despite Hazaribagh being a BJP stronghold, this time Jaiswal seems to be facing a tough challenge from Singh who is eating into BJP votes. Prasad is banking on traditional Congress votes as well as of those unhappy with the workings of the Raghubar Das government.
Rivals Singh and Prasad often mock the “double-engine sarkar” that the BJP refers to. Singh charged Jaiswal with not looking into whether new roads were made well and alleged widespread corruption in their construction. He pointed out that nothing much had been done to beautify the town’s pride, Hazaribagh Lake. “In paanch salon mein weh sanvedanheen rahe (He remained insensitive during these five years),” alleged the JVM candidate who had formed ‘Team Munna’, a group of young volunteers who arrange blood donations and help the needy.
Prasad, on the other hand, promised to develop the seat taking everyone into confidence as stakeholders.
A voter said this election promises to be interesting. “Jaiswalji is popular and accessible, but Munnaji (JVM’s Singh) has suddenly become rather well-liked among a lot of people. Munnaji was in the Congress.
“When he was denied a ticket, he switched sides and joined the JVM. But Munnaji has his own followers, no matter which party, and has disturbed the BJP’s calculations.”

Ichagarh’s dam-damned in focus once again," Resentment among those displaced for the Chandil Dam over the failure of successive governments to arrange for special rehabilitation compensation package for them is set to be a major issue for the Ichagarh Assembly seat that votes on Thursday.
Thousands of families were displaced for the dam, which was constructed under the Subernarekha Multipurpose Project (SMP) in the 1980s. They are yet to receive proper compensation and rehabilitation.
“Before displacement everyone had a few acres of land but everything was lost after the submergence threat by the Chandil Dam, forcing us to shift to rehabilitation land. But life is miserable,” said Inderjit Sonar, 50, a resident of Khukru rehabilitation centre under Khukru block of Ichagarh constituency.
“There is no proper electricity nor drinking water. We are yet to get a suitable job which was promised by the government. We had hopes from the ‘double-engine sarkar’ but nothing happened even under this government,” Sonar added.
As per the data given by the SMP office, a total of 116 villages were displaced and 19,115 families were affected by the dam. Land for rehabilitation has been allocated to over 1,400 families while compensation amounts of Rs 6.75 lakh have been given to nearly 10,774 families. However, they are demanding special compensation package including proper arrangements like schools, drinking water supply and playgrounds at the 13 rehabilitation centres and a job to one member of each affected family.
“Every year the political leaders put the matter of displaced people on top of their agenda in the run-up to elections but forget them soon post-election,” said Prakash Kumar, a Chandil-based trader.
Sitting BJP MLA Sadhu Charan Mahato said: “I had been raising the issue of Chandil Dam displacement and very soon the Centre is going to announce a big decision on the Chandil Dam displacement issue.”
JMM candidate Sabita Mahato also promised to solve the issue.
“There has been a BJP government most of the time in the state and this time there was BJP government at the Centre and the state but they failed to sort out the issue. Arranging compensation and proper rehabilitation would be top of my agenda this time,” Sabita said.
Ichagarh Assembly seat has 2.92 lakh voters and 337 polling booths. In the 2014 state polls, winning candidate Sadhu Charan of the BJP polled 75,634 votes (42.65 per cent) while Sabita, wife of the late JMM senior leader Sudhir Mahato, polled 33,384 (18.2 per cent). Arvind Kumar Singh polled 28,999 (16.35 per cent). All three are in the fray this year too; there is also Hare Lal Mahato of the Ajsu Party.",states
Veggie bowl wants ketchup to fight poverty," Simaria, an Assembly constituency under Chatra Lok Sabha seat that is among the 17 seats in the third phase of voting, is known as one of Jharkhand’s vegetable bowls, especially for growing tonnes of tomatoes and green chillies.
But instead of selling tomatoes and chillies at throwaway prices to middlemen, farmers, especially the young, want ketchup factories in Simaria, some 120km from state capital Ranchi. A reasonable demand no political party has heeded. Simaria farmers continue to be dependent on rain-fed agriculture and sell their produce at local haats. Produce and prices are unpredictable, poverty is not.
Simaria seat, which has six blocks, including Tandwa that earned a name due to three big coal projects including the NTPC 1980MW Super Thermal Power Plant and CCL’s open-cast projects at Amrapali and Magadh, also has industrial potential. But local youths have not yet been absorbed in these projects (who is saying this?).
For years, youths from Simaria migrate in droves for jobs as under-construction workers, a lucky few pick up a skill on the way such as welding and earn more.
This election, people of Simaria have flagged the issue of job opportunities here. But job opportunities hardly find mention during heated poll rallies. Personality clashes and ideological warfare do.
In the 2014 polls, voters here voted for JVM candidate Ganesh Ganjhu, the brother of Brajesh Ganjhu, the supremo of a banned rebel outfit, the Tritiya Prastuti Committee.
Ganesh, who debuted in 2009 on a JMM ticket, soon shifted to the BJP. But a shock awaited him this elections, when the saffron party denied him a ticket, and fielded grassroots party worker Kishun Kumar Das.
For Das, too, the going has not been easy. With the BJP-Ajsu alliance falling through, BJP’s former junior ally has fielded Manoj Chandra, the son of former Simaria MLA, late Ramchandra Ram.
The twist came when the Congress — which got Simaria as a part of its seat-sharing math with the JMM and RJD — gave a ticket to former MLA Yogendra Nath Baitha. In the fight, the other well-known contestants are CPI’s Binod Bihari Paswan and the JVM’s Ramdev Singh Bhokta, though in all 18 contestants are in the fray. Which specific block each of Simaria’s popular contestants hails from may also have a bearing on votes, a local political watcher said. “BJP’s Das is from Tandwa block, Manoj Chandra of the Ajsu Party and Paswan of the CPI are from Simaria, JVM’s Bhokta is from Giddhore and Baitha from Itkhori. Only Lawalong and Pathalgadda blocks under the constituency have no known faces this polls. If people of each block votes for their local candidate, votes will be divided and the victory margin will be narrow. Moreover, who woos votes of Lawalong and Pathalgadda will become important. Nothing can be said for sure,” said the local expert.
He added with a chuckle: “Actually, if you look at Simaria’s poll history, this seat is one of a kind. So far, voters here have given a chance to the BJP, the Congress, the CPI, the RJD and the JVM.”
A BJP leader claimed they were “fully hopeful of Das winning this seat”, even though he admitted Chandra, Bhokta and Paswan had kept themselves active in public life.
Voters seem to be playing it by the ear. Septuagenarian Nandkishore Yadav of Tandwa said: “Other than green vegetables, Simaria is also known for producing milk, but this naturally blessed place is so poor. We want some concrete plans so that our sons don’t have to leave us and go to cities in search of jobs. We have changed our MLA a number of times but not got what we wanted. We want a ketchup factory and milk processing unit to come up here and put a check on migration.”
Student Aniket Kumar of Chatra College agreed with the old man.
“Badlav ke bawajud bhi is ilaake ki kuch khas tarakki nahi huyi (There have been a lot of changes, but not much progress here),” he said. Asked which way the wind is blowing, he shrugged.

Ranchi's RIMS hospital cleared of squatters," A team from Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) removed encroachments from RIMS premises, Kutchery Chowk, Jaquir Hussain Park and Radium Road on Saturday to ensure smoother movement of traffic through these areas.
During the drive, which started at 11.30am and continued till 5pm, as many as five makeshift kiosks selling breakfast snacks and six hand carts selling fruits were seized from the RIMS premises.
From Kutchery Chowk and Jaquir Hussain Park localities, 18 tables and chairs, three benches, three plastic water containers, 12 pieces of tarpaulin and flower pots, besides other items were seized. These apart, several temporary structures were also removed.
On Radium Road, a tilkut shop that was eating into road space was removed after uprooting bamboo poles used to set it up. Later, the RMC team seized the poles.
A resident of Bariatu, Deepak Kumar was upset at the drive since food vendors, from whom relatives of patients at RIMS bought snacks, were no longer there.
“Relatives of patients admitted at RIMS depend on vendors for fruits and other items of day-to-day use. After the drive, they suffered a lot as they had to go out of the RIMS campus to buy necessities,” he said.
City manager Sourabh Kumar Verma, who led the RMC’s enforcement team, said apart from removing encroachments, they also acted against the use of plastic carry bags.
“After the anti-encroachment drive, we also carried out a drive against plastic bags at Morbadi ground. We imposed fines on vendors found using plastic bags. We collected Rs 4,100 in fines from vendors on Saturday. In the last four days, we collected Rs 17,000 fines,” Verma said.
Verma said the RMC would continue with the drive. “Keeping city traffic in mind, our drive (against encroachers) will continue. No one has the right to disrupt traffic,” he said.",states
Hemant to flag off special train of workers from Dumka," In a first, chief minister Hemant Soren will flag off a special train, carrying around 1500 workers, for BRO projects on Friday – a development that comes close on the heels of the state government's consent to the organisation for recruiting workers from the state provided they register as an employer under the provisions of Interstate Migrant Workmen Act.
Additional Director General of Border Road Organization (BRO), Anil Kumar met Hemant at the Jharkhand Ministry on Thursday and assured to take necessary steps in connection with the government's conditions for sending workers to the frontiers for road construction works, an official from the chief minister's office said.
An MoU will be signed by the BRO officials and Dumka district administration before the workers leave in the special train from Dumka district, a press handout from the government said. Kumar said that BRO has sought the permission of Ministry of Defence to make an MoU between BRO and Jharkhand Labour Department too.
After approval of the Ministry of Defence, the process of MoU will be completed so that the Labour Department can provide proper support to the BRO, Kumar said. While the government did not clarify where the workers were headed, a close aide of the chief minister said that they would be sent to Jammu for road construction works.
Hemant, during the meeting, asked Kumar to maintain transparency in their appointment process and do away with all middlemen. “The workers should be treated well,” he said.
The Jharkhand CM said that workers of Jharkhand should be ensured timely remittance of wages to their bank account every month under the provisions of labour laws. Since these workers do road construction work in difficult terrains under challenging conditions, their safety should also be taken care of, he added.
The BRO has taken all appropriate steps for safety, wages and welfare of the the workers who are going for the road construction work in the border areas of the country, Kumar assured Hemant during the meeting.
The BRO, officials said, had a machinery called 'mates' in place. These mates worked as agents and brought cartels of workers from Jharkhand's poverty-stricken Santhal Pargana region to work in the BRO. A major chunk of the wages were allegedly taken away by the mates and the workers got little money to meet their ends, officials said.
Workers from tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand have been serving the BRO since 1970s. However, the process was never regulated. If highly placed sources in the chief minister's office are to be believed, then Defence Minister Rajnath Singh himself asked Hemant to intervene in the matter after the latter apprised him about the state of affairs.
The government's move assumes significance as tension simmers at the Line of Control between India and China. Besides, migrants from Jharkhand, mostly trafficked by slave trading agents, have been subjected to inhuman treatment in other parts of the countries since decades. Jharkhand is also one of the worst-affected states when it comes to human trafficking. ",states
"Public coined Corona Express, not me: CM Mamata Banerjee"," Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday clarified that she had not coined the term “Corona Express” to describe the Shramik Special trains and was only quoting “the public”, a day after Amit Shah had said Bengali migrant labourers would not forgive her for the remark.
“Many of you (the media) misinterpreted… I had never said Corona Express. I had said the public had said. If you take out my statement of the first day (May 29)… I was telling you that the public had been saying so,” said the Bengal chief minister.
“Amphan on one side, Covid-19 on another, a nationwide atmosphere of fear, destruction in work, decimation of plans…. On top of that, amid even a pandemic, instead of standing by the people, rajniti korar j ekta obibechawk durobhishondhi (the inconsiderate malice of doing politics)…. What we can see is that there are only a few who would speak for the people today,” she added, apparently referring to the Union home minister.
Shah had spent considerable time of the BJP’s virtual rally for Bengal on Tuesday, accusing the Mamata government of being apathetic towards the plight of the migrant workers.
He said he had been shocked when Mamata had referred to the Shramik Special trains — meant to ferry migrant workers back to their home states — as Corona Expresses.
“The Bengali migrant labourer will not forgive you for this. The Corona Express will be the reason for your exit,” Shah said. A Trinamul Congress leader said Mamata’s calm clarification — not the one of her signature aggressive counterattacks — on Wednesday suggested her understanding of the seriousness of the issue and how the BJP was strategising to turn the tables of the migrants crisis on her.
The Trinamul chief had mentioned “Corona Express” twice at a news conference on May 29 while blasting the railway ministry for its alleged mishandling of transportation of migrant workers.
“Why must they (the railway ministry) make four people sit in every seat, for 48-72hours? That too from hotspot states. Why can’t the railway ministry give more trains to ensure social distancing? You won’t do it,” she had said.
Mamata went on: “A mother lying dead in the station, her baby roaming about (referring to the Muzaffarpur incident). Why such utter disregard? In the name of Shramik Express, you want to make Corona Express out of these trains?”
At the same news conference, the chief minister later said: “Do you know what the villagers are saying (about approaching Shramik Special trains)? ‘See, Corona Express is coming! Run away, run away!’ What is this? Law and order problems are being caused because of you (railway minister Piyush Goyal).”
Reacting to Mamata’s clarification, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said on Wednesday: “She doesn’t think before she says things and then she does not own up to what she said without thinking. She has been doing this for a long time. I would advise her to think, long and hard, before saying anything.”",states
TMC worker shot dead," Trinamul worker Amir Ali Sardar was gunned down in Basanti, South 24-Parganas, amid murmurs of infighting within the ruling party.
Sardar’s family said he had left home at 4am when some men shot him at close range.
“Aminuddin and his men from the youth Trinamul were hurling bombs. When my brother tried to stop them he was shot,” alleged Ekramuddin, the victim’s brother. Allegedly, Aminuddin works for MLA Saokat Molla and aide Aman Molla. TMC leader Abdul Mannan Gaji accused MLA Molla of “spreading terror in Basanti”.
Aman Molla called the murder a case of family feud.",states
One Amit counters another with numbers," Amit Shah had a challenger with the same first name on Tuesday.
A visibly prepared Trinamul Congress — assisted by Team Prashant Kishor — took on the BJP’s challenge and worked hard on social media to discredit Union home minister Amit Shah and his virtual rally, before fielding state finance minister Amit Mitra to counter the BJP’s “jumla” with figures.
Lambasting Shah for prioritising electoral politics during the pandemic and in the wake of Cyclone Amphan, Mitra said: “I challenge Mr. Shah… to respond. Where is that cash?”
Trinamul started its “virtual attack” a short while before the Union home minister’s virtual rally began.
Mamata Banerjee’s party, backed by poll strategist Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee, made hashtags such as #BengalRejectsAmitShah and #BanglaChaaynaAmitShah (Bengal doesn’t want Amit Shah) trend with tens of thousands of tweets on Twitter throughout the event, at times bettering the mega machinery of saffron propaganda.
But the “masterstroke”, according to a Bengal minister, was the idea of fielding state finance minister Amit Shah to call Shah out on his “lies”. “Shah had dared Didi (Mamata) to come out with figures to counter him. Our Amit’s figures badly exposed their Amit’s jumla,” said the minister.
Excerpts from Mitra’s rebuttal:
The tendency to ‘copy’:
On December 30, 2016, the honourable chief minister (Mamata) introduced a scheme called Swasthya Sathi, covering 1.5 crore families, 7.5 crore people, so that their medical needs and treatment are taken care of. Benefit of Rs 5 lakh, with 1,518 network hospitals.
Almost two years later, Ayushman Bharat was suddenly heard of...it was but a poor attempt to copy. Our achievements are there on record. Imitation masters. No thoughts of your own?
The peddling of ‘lies’:
He (Shah) said 7.66 crore people are being helped through the PDS. What is the truth? It is 6.01 crore people. Why was the number inflated? Jhoot, jhoot. Our government here has been giving free food grains to 4.09 crore for three months and will do so for six months. You forgot? Will the people forget, you think?
When we (Trinamul) came to power, there were 75 lakh consumers of power in the state, in 2011. That number is over 2 crore — 1.95 crore households — now. Also probably the only state that is power surplus and no power cuts. Total amount from the Centre since 2011, Rs 5,800 crore for the sector. The state invested Rs 27,500 crore in the same time span.
What Amit (Shah) did omit:
Rs 53,000 crore in dues to state, left unpaid by the Centre. Of that, Rs 36,000 crore, directly for centrally supported schemes and central schemes. Besides, GST dues, food subsidy dues and Rs 11,000 crore in devolution. Rs 1,000 crore given so far for superstorm Amphan. When you are addressing Bengal, release a tranche of that Rs 53,000 crore, Rs 15,000 crore, at least.
The state of the economy:
In 2018, due to demonetisation and unprepared GST...2 crore jobs were lost, according to the CMIE.
Now, for seven consecutive quarters, there has been a decline in GDP growth, all pre-Covid. January to March quarters, 3.1 per cent growth, lowest in 11 years. Unemployment rate, in 2018, was the lowest in 45 years.
Today, after Covid-19, it is 23.5 per cent nationally. In Bengal, it is 17.4 per cent, in big BJP-ruled states Karnataka, 20.4, Uttar Pradesh, 21, Madhya Pradesh, 27, Haryana, 35.
All countries in the world are giving 50 per cent in cash…. What did you give? She (Mamata) had said, “big zero”.
Fiscal stimulus? The US gave 2.2 trillion dollars. Economists are now debating whether it (India’s) was 0.9 per cent of GDP or 1.1 per cent? Ten per cent? A hoax.
Say it, ‘we will not give cash’. Migrant workers stand denied.
The whole world is giving cash. Why? Demand will return. The moment demand returns, supply will respond. As soon as that happens, investments will start.
What is actually happening? Banks are putting money back into the RBI. Yes, banks returned Rs 6.3 lakh crore to the RBI…. Because they do not have faith in India’s leadership…. Hence, risk-averse.
Responding to Mitra’s rebuttal, BJP state unit Dilip Ghosh said later that he does not believe in what the state finance minister has to say.
“I have no faith in those figures. This state government has no credibility,” said the Midnapore MP.",states
Main roads of Calcutta still off limits for cycles," Police have issued a notification allowing free movement of cycles in all roads and lanes in Calcutta except for “main arterial roads and flyovers”.
Earlier, cycling during the day was prohibited in many of the city’s roads and lanes.
The move came a day after the state cabinet approved a policy of allowing cycles on “all small and medium roads” on Monday to ease the hardship of people in reaching offices and other destinations in the absence of adequate public transport.
“Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue a notification mentioning small and medium roads where cycles will be allowed. The decision has been taken considering that people are facing trouble to reach offices or workplaces in the absence of Metro,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said at Nabanna on Monday.
Based on the directive, a notification was issued by the police on Tuesday.
“For the sake of convenience of general public and in view of the restrictions imposed on public transport during the ongoing Corona pandemic… do hereby order that bicycles will be allowed in the lanes and bylanes within Calcutta Police jurisdiction. Restrictions will continue on the main arterial roads, flyovers and any other area as notified from time to time,” the notification signed by city police commissioner Anuj Sharma said.
The notification reminded cyclists that they were not above traffic rules. “Cyclists should obey one-way restrictions and other traffic rules and regulations.”
The order came into effect from Tuesday and will be in force till July 30.
Cycling was completely restricted or limited between 11pm and 7am on 62 roads and flyovers in the city. According to the new rule, cycles will be free to move on these roads without any restriction, the police said.
“There are many lanes in the city that run parallel to the thoroughfares. If people want to commute through these, they will not be stopped,” a traffic police officer said.
Cycles will be allowed on thoroughfares only at crossings to reach a lane, the officer said.
Several Calcuttans have started using cycles, mostly because there is not enough public transport to accommodate everyone going to office. Some have been peddling more than 20km to reach their offices in Calcutta to avoid the discomfort of travelling in an overcrowded bus in the absence of local trains.
Traditionally, slow-moving vehicles like hand-pulled carts, rickshaws and cycles are banned on major roads
because they reduce the speed of other vehicles, the police said.
“Just because a cycle does not have a number plate and cannot be identified it does not mean a cyclist will not be prosecuted if found violating traffic rules,” a traffic police officer said.
Allegations often emerge that the slow moving vehicles do not follow the traffic rules and often result into causing accidents when they illegally come out on the thoroughfares.
By officially allowing cycles on the lanes and bylanes, the police would expect the bicyclists to be more cautious about the traffic rules.",states
Aid for stranded Indian students," They have their back to the wall on foreign soil yet cannot afford to return. The lockdown has jeopardised life for Indian students in British institutes of higher education. Now local Bengali associations along with other Indian communities have come to their aid.
“Our weekly earnings from working for 20 hours have dried up with all shops downing shutters. We rely heavily on that money for our rent and boarding. Without a car I cannot reach the Indian grocery stores as taking public transport has risk of Covid-19 infection. My Indian friends at the London School of Fashion too are surviving on bread and soup,” said Samrat Dutta, a marketing student of Kingston University.
Barsha Bhattacharya, an MBA student, was in even worse state. The Bagha Jatin girl had landed barely three months ago to study at the University of South Wales. She came on a student loan and needed a job. But on March 23, lockdown started in the UK. Back in Calcutta, her father was not getting his salary and suddenly she was on her own. “I am desperate for work. Though it is risky to go out, I have my rent, electricity and gas bills to pay at the apartment I am sharing with three others.”
Things reached such a head that for two weeks she survived only on lunch. “But my health deteriorated so much that I had to start eating at night.”
At this point, she heard of a group created by an Indian students’ union to help those facing financial problems and provide them with free groceries. Soon, a month’s supply reached her and Samrat.
The supplies were funded by a consortium of social groups of non-resident Indians. “Thirty per cent of the foreign students here are Indians. When they could not find work and pay rent, many faced eviction threats. Some faced food scarcity. We are working with the Indian National Students Association and other groups,” said Vikram Banerjee of Basingstoke Hindu Society, who is also a member of Sewa Day.
“In Cardiff, we provided funds with which the association helped students. Some got packets of daal, ata, rice, oil etc. Others got supermarket vouchers,” he added.
In Slough, Adda Slough cooks 150 meals twice a day at the local temple. “We are transferring funds to students’ unions,” said president Nilotpal Mandal. “We connected with students in the west London suburbs. Together with our associates, we have helped about 150 students,” said Prasenjit Bhattacharjee, a member.",states
Buses for CMC staff," The state transport department will run buses for Calcutta Municipal Corporation employees from Wednesday from various parts in the city, civic officials said on Tuesday.
The buses will originate from Baruipur-Padmapukur crossing, Barrackpore station, Diamond Harbour station, Garden Reach Borough XV office, Joka, Kalyani, Bandel and Barasat Dak Bungalow crossing.
A CMC employee said it was still not clear if the buses would run to civic offices in the city other than the headquarters on SN Banerjee Road.",states
How a rural stay-safe campaign worked," An imam of a mosque and a leader of the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) in Dinhata subdivision of Cooch Behar are visiting homes in villages with more minority population to spread awareness on the novel coronavirus contagion.
Maulana Adam Shafiullah, the imam of a mosque in Sholmari of Nazirhat in Dinhata, along with Abdur Rauf, the state president of All India Yuva League (the youth’s front of Forward Bloc) who is also from Nazirhat, are roaming the villages to give “correct information” about Covid-19 and distributing food relief and masks among the poor minority families.
Shafiullah told The Telegraph that he felt the task was vital, going by the gravity of the situation. “I felt it important to visit households and tell people how to save themselves from infection. I specifically pointed out that they should refrain from assembling in mosques for weekly prayers to maintain social distancing,” he said.
The imam who keeps moving across villages with Rauf also passed a missive to all imams and muezzins in 36 other smaller mosques under him to step out and campaign among people in their respective areas on social distancing, use of masks and hand-washing. “These three things apart, I also told them to tell people at large to keep senior citizens and children below 10 years indoors,” the imam added.
“We also ask residents to be in constant touch with migrant workers, many of whom are returning homes,” he added.
Rauf added that they asked family members of a returning migrant worker to take the lead and ask the returnee to follow government directives.
Their efforts have led to results in and around Nazirhat, Dinhata-II block, with a population of over 50,000 with a 45 per cent minority population.
People did stay indoors, even during Id, and there were hardly any iftar parties, which otherwise is a common trend during Ramazan.
As of now, Dinhata has reported around 100 Covid-19 cases but many have recovered. The most important takeaway from the duo’s efforts, Rauf felt, was that returning migrant workers followed the government’s directives of quarantine. “People were aware, they acted responsibly, and that’s why the spread of the infection was not as rapid as it might have been in the area.”
Rauf added that they went to Muslim and Hindu households alike.
“In fact, we handed over relief materials to some families of Hindu priests who were in distress as the temples were closed till last week,” he said.",states
Flames leap from oil well," A massive fire broke out at the Baghjan oil well after an explosion on Tuesday afternoon and spread to nearby areas, burning houses and trees and prompting a second round of exodus after the recent blowout-driven evacuation.
Television images showed flames leaping 30-40ft into the sky and ending in a plume of black smoke that people said was visible from Tinsukia town, 15km away.
A fire-fighter from ONGCL suffered “minor injuries” in the blaze, which set off “violent” protests that led to a few Oil India employees being “manhandled” and a few vehicles damaged, an Oil India official said.
A company official said “the army has been deployed to assist the police and maintain order” while the chief minister’s office said the air force was on standby to help fight the fire, if necessary. Some 20 fire tenders were trying to control the fire in the evening.
The 1,610 families evacuated after the May 27 blowout of crude and natural gas and lodged in relief camps 1.5km from the site were hurriedly shifted to new camps 15km away, Baghjan resident Hemanta Moran said, indicating the size of the area endangered by the blaze. Many others from nearby areas were seen leaving on foot and on pickup vans and trucks after the flames began leaping around 1.30pm and damaged “20 to 25” empty houses of the already evacuated families, local people said.
Oil India said the fire broke out during clearing operations in the well, and while plans to control the continuing blowout were being chalked out with a team of three just-arrived experts from Singapore.
It said that following the fire, the entire capping operations would now take four weeks.
The experts from the Singapore-based company, Alert Disaster Control, had arrived in Duliajan, 45km from Baghjan, in the early hours of Monday.
Local people said the fire posed a threat to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park, about 300 metres from the oil well, and the Maguri-Motapung Beel (wetland), 500 metres away.
With local anger, already simmering over the continuing blowout since May 27, threatening to explode after the fire, the CRPF has also been sent in to help maintain order.
Personnel from the NDRF and SDRF are helping with the relief operations at the site, about 530km east of Guwahati.
“Although the fire is still raging, we have managed to contain the spread of the fire to the peripheral areas,” an Oil India official said late in the evening.
He said that because of the fire, the gas and its condensate (chemical spray) would no longer trouble the nearby areas.
Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal spoke to defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan to seek help in dousing the fire.
A CMO statement said Sonowal had requested Rajnath to “deploy the air force for controlling the fire”, and that Pradhan later told him the air force was on standby.
Oil India said that its officials and those of the ONGC were being evacuated from nearby areas.
“Once the situation is normal, the experts from Alert and the staff of OIL/ONGC will move to the site. Oil and ONGC were to mount a joint operation on Thursday to cap the well,” it said.
“The situation demands (an) arrangement of large quantities of water, installation of high-discharge pumps and removal of debris. All the operations as per Alert will take about four weeks. Efforts will be made to reduce this timeframe as much as possible.”
Nirantar Gohain, a local environment activist, said the ecology would be “under threat” if the well were not capped soon.
Congress MLA Debabrata Saikia, leader of the Opposition in Assam, said the state government should pressure the Centre to “bring in American experts, such as (those from) the company founded by the late (oil well fire-fighter) Red Adair to control the situation, instead of some relatively unknown Singaporean company”.
Saikia demanded immediate compensation for the affected families.",states
Reopening of places of worship in abeyance," The Meghalaya government, along with various religious groups, on Tuesday decided to postpone the decision to reopen places of worship.
On June 5, the first meeting between the government and representatives of religious groups decided to reopen the places of worship from June 14 onwards. These places were shut since the first lockdown began towards the end of March.
However, after the second meeting held here on Tuesday, it was decided that the reopening of such places should be kept in abeyance at least till the end of this month.
“A majority of the religious leaders representing churches, temples, mosques felt that we should postpone the decision of reopening the places of worship from June 14,” chief minister Conrad K. Sangma said.
He said the decision to reopen the places of worship was revisited keeping in mind the priority that has been given to health and safety, and the fact that many stranded citizens are still on their way back to Meghalaya.
Conrad said the places of worship will not be reopened till the end of this month.
Towards the end of the month, a consultation would be held to decide the way forward.
There were many who had expressed concern over the decision to reopen the places of worship from June 14 onwards although the state government had issued the standard operating procedures and protocol that need to be observed by all such places. ",states
Communal harmony at Giridih funeral," A funeral in Giridih proved that communal harmony is still a cherished value.
When Lakhia Devi, the septuagenarian mother of Jogeshwar Turi died in Giridih on Saturday afternoon, his Muslim neighbours were first to reach their house and many of them accompanied him to cremate his mother on Sunday.
Though Jogeshwar’s relatives who live in far away could not reach, others living in nearby areas reached for the funeral. They were joined by Jogeshwar’s Muslim neighbours. “This is nothing new as we have always been very close to one another in our tola (locality),” said Sarfaraz Ansari, a youngman of the locality, adding they were peacefully living in the area “just like relatives”.
Jogeshwar is one of the two Hindu families living in Muslim dominated Nicha Tola of Paharidih village under Giridih muffasil police station area though more Hindus reside at Upar Tola, the other locality of the same village. He further informed that they all stand by one another whenever such need arises.
Lakhia Devi was unwell after she suffered a paralytic attack a week ago and breathed her last on Saturday afternoon.
“The funeral was taken out on Sunday after her relatives arrived,” Ansari informed, adding many of them such as Mohammad Shamshad, Mohammad Bilal and Mohammad Tahir joined the funeral procession, did whatever was required and stayed till the cremation was over.
They had attended the cremation even when Jogeshwar’s father who died a few years ago, Ansari further said, adding their Hindu neighbours also do the same whenever there is bereavement in a Muslim family. They also join one another whenever there is a happy occasion, he said.
“We actually also had a sense of gratitude to the lady,” Ansari further said, adding she once acted as a midwife in the village and had helped many women of the village during their labour and even took care of and nursed the newborns. “Some of my uncles got such nursing from her,” he further said, indicating they were thus sort of indebted to the deceased woman.",states
Luxury hotels of Calcutta try to lure customers with discounts and benefits," Eager to get their customers back, most luxury hotels in Calcutta are doing what they have seldom done before.
Discounts of up to 50 per cent on room tariff and other facilities such as spa and sauna, concession on food rates at restaurants, flexible reservation and cancellation policies, digital menu cards replacing physical ones — the city’s star addresses opened on Monday after 74 days with a range of offers aimed at restoring the pre-Covid occupancy.
The tariff of a deluxe twin room at JW Marriott is Rs 9,500 per night (without taxes). The EM Bypass hotel is offering almost half the price between June 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, if the booking is done this month, according to its website.
The condition is that the bookings are non-transferable, meaning the person booking a room cannot transfer the booking to another individual.
The Oberoi Grand is offering a 20 per cent discount on room tariff if the booking is made through its website.
A customer ordered a 12-inch thin crust chicken pizza at The Bridge, a restaurant at The Park, on Monday. It cost Rs 1,210, instead of the usual price of Rs 1,593 (both include 18 per cent GST). The discounts on other food items ranged between 15 and 20 per cent.
Hospitality majors such as Marriott, Taj Bengal and The Park said the idea was to increase the footfall after a prolonged lockdown and cater to the needs of the customers looking for food and room while keeping in mind the liquidity constraints.
Not everyone has gone for a reduction in tariff — some are packaging benefits as part of the booking. Taj Bengal, for instance, is offering daily hotel credit of Rs 3,000 per room per night, which can be used for food and beverage, spa and laundry. The hotel is also offering upgrades to the next room category (except suites) based on availability and 20 per cent discount on salon and spa as part of the booking.
The hotel is also offering flexible cancellation to avoid a penalty of one night, plus applicable taxes and fees, said officials.
A major change is replacement of physical menu cards at restaurants in the hotels with digital ones. A guest has to scan a QR code to get the digital menu card on his or her mobile phone.
“This is an innovation keeping in mind the safety and sanitisation requirements. It also has the benefit of tweaking the menu without the need to reprint,” said chef Sharad Dewan of The Park, Calcutta. It also saves cost.
A key concern of most hospitality chains is the non-availability of certain items such as imported cheese, salmon, tuna etc. The other concern is that alcohol cannot be served, based on a government directive.
The footfall at many of the star restaurants did not cross 20 per cent on the first day. The managements hope the offers will help push up the footfall.
“We have introduced a scheme called ‘Save Now Stay Later’ across all our hotels in India. The scheme offers discounts ranging from 30 to 50 per cent. While the scheme is flexible, it’s not transferable. The offer is for a limited period and we will go back to normal rates,” said Gaurav Singh, general manager, JW Marriott, Calcutta.
The hotels have also adopted a range of hygiene norms and are conveying them to prospective customers through various platforms to allay their concerns over contracting the coronavirus.
“We are excited and relieved with the opening of our restaurants, at the same time we also understand that we have to move forward with caution and ensure complete safety for our guests and associates.... Hopefully the situation would gradually improve,” said Manish Gupta, general manager, Taj Bengal.",states
"10,000 homeless as wave wrecks dam"," At least 10,000 people of two gram panchayat areas were rendered homeless on Monday after a 50-metre stretch of a thatched dam on river Goureshwar was swept away by a fresh tidal wave during the early hours in Hingalganj of Hansnabad block of North 24-Parganas.
The dam in Rupmari panchayat area, which suffered serious damage in Cyclone Amphan on May 20 and was being repaired, was swept by a heavy tidal wave that triggered a flood-like situation.
Large tracts of farmland and fish ponds suffered fresh damage due to inflow of saline water of the Goureshwar, which is an estuarine river.
A school run under the Integrated Child Development Scheme also went under water.
The district administration shifted a large number of people to shelter homes and gave them relief materials. However, several people complained that relief materials stayed elusive till Monday afternoon. “Till afternoon (Monday) no one from the district administration offered us food or relief material,” a villager told The Telegraph.

The villagers, however, had an appeal to the government — repair the dam well.
“Let us remain without food or relief items, but repair the dam in a manner that the situation doesn’t recur every year,” said homemaker Chandana Maiti Bera.
Chandana was echoing what many villagers feel — that the administration has not done enough to repair the thatched dam the past fortnight even though the tidal wave was expected to hit the river. Residents have questioned the administration for banking on patch work rather than coming up with a permanent solution to the problem.
“Damage to the dams due to tidal waves has become a recurring problem. We always live in fear of losing everything. The Amphan this year washed away our homes...We were trying to get back to normal life, but the tidal wave during the past few days washed away our efforts. Unfortunately, the irrigation department failed to repair the dam after it was damaged by Amphan on May 20,” said Prasanta Mandal, a resident in Rupmari.
Chandana said she and many others were living on a raised road after Amphan left them homeless. “We feared a fresh tidal wave would not just damage the dam, but the road on which we had taken shelter. Our worst fears came true early on Monday. We are worried that the situation would worsen during monsoon.”
Hansnabad panchayat samiti pradhan Archana Hira, however, tried to refute the allegations of delay in repairing the dam. “The dam was not strong enough since it suffered damage in Amphan. We could not get much time to repair it despite our efforts,” she said.
A source said the local administration had told minister Suvendu Adhikary about the “weak dams” when he visited the area last week so that major repairs could be done.
A state irrigation department official in Basirhat said they were “helpless”. “We could do little as the tidal wave has been coming for days,” he said.",states
Nod for cycling on select roads of Calcutta," The state cabinet has approved a policy of allowing bicycles on all small and medium roads in Calcutta and other major urban areas to ease the hardship to reach offices and other destinations in the absence of metro and local trains.
“The Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue a notification mentioning small and medium roads where bicycles will be allowed. The decision has been taken considering that people are facing trouble to reach offices or work in the absence of metro,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at Nabanna on Monday.
“People’s lives are most important.... Busy roads will be avoided to avert accidents. The Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue the list of roads after careful consideration.”
Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma told The Telegraph: “We are working on a plan so that safety of cyclists is not compromised and... there is no disturbance to normal flow of traffic in the city.”
Cycling is banned 24X7 on 22 thoroughfares in the city, including Park Street, Theatre Road, Camac Street, Red Road, Lalbazar Street, Council House Street, Rawdon Street and all flyovers. On 40 other thoroughfares such as Chowringhee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Central Avenue and some other roads, cycling is allowed from 11pm to 7am.
During the lockdown, many people had cycled to work on these thoroughfares. Police sources said traffic cops had not prosecuted them on humanitarian grounds.
“Usually, slow moving vehicles like a bicycle reduces the speed of other vehicles. That is the primary reason why they are not allowed on major thoroughfares. But we made an exception and did not prosecute cyclists during the lockdown as public transport was absent,” said an officer in the traffic police.
There are separate cycle tracks in several parts of the country for free movement of cycles.
Sources said the proposal — a temporary one because of non-availability of adequate public transport — was put forward by the heads of various departments after it was found that many employees could not reach office on Monday. Government offices started functioning with 70 per cent employees during the day.
Various employees unions said attendance in different departments was around 60 per cent on Monday.
“Many government employees stay in parts of North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly and depend on local trains and metro to reach office. These services are not available, so many employees could not reach office,” said a leader of the Trinamul-backed employees union.",states
Risk zones in Bengal locked till June 30," The state cabinet on Monday decided to extend the lockdown in Bengal’s containment zones till June 30 on the lines of the Centre’s recent notification.

Earlier, the state government had decided to extend the lockdown in containment zones till June 15.

Bengal govt urges operators to run more buses," The state government on Sunday urged private bus and minibus operators to ensure more buses from Monday when more people will be out on the roads as offices, malls and restaurants open.
Some private operators, however, insisted on an immediate fare revision before rolling out more buses and minibuses.
At a meeting with private operators on Sunday, transport department officials asked bus owners to let them know in writing why they wanted a fare hike while explaining income and expenditure. But before that bus owners should ensure more buses on the roads from Monday, officials told the operators at the meeting.
Several operators said they would try and run additional buses but the demand-supply gap would still remain.

Woman and mother die in quick succession in Calcutta," A 56-year-old woman and her mother who had appeared frail to a doctor when he last visited them on Thursday died within hours of each other in Salt Lake’s BE Block on Saturday night.
Sharmistha Kar Purkayastha, 56, former wife of state security adviser Surajit Kar Purkayastha, and her mother Papia De, 77, were found in critical condition at their BE-71 home by some of their relatives on Saturday evening, police said.
A doctor on call examined them and announced they had died. They were declared dead at Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital.
Some relatives of the deceased women had earlier tried to get them admitted to a hospital because they had “Covid-19 like symptoms”, the police said. They apparently preferred staying at home.
The relatives had reached their home on Saturday evening to persuade them to go to hospital.
“On Saturday evening, when some relatives went to visit them, they found Papia De lying motionless…. Sharmistha Kar Purkayastha’s condition was very serious. A doctor reached their home around 9pm and said both had passed away,” Surya Pratap Yadav, deputy commissioner of the Bidhannagar commissionerate, said. “The relatives took both of them to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional hospital where both were declared brought dead.”
Preliminary investigations suggested the relatives had tried to get them admitted to hospital on Friday but failed because the women were unwilling to leave home, Yadav said.
The bodies underwent post-mortem on Sunday. Preliminary reports have ruled out foul play, the police said.
Sharmistha, an MSc in biology with a postdoctoral degree in antibiotics, had worked as the principal of Gyan Bharati Balika Vidyalaya. She had joined the BJP in 2014.
“Sharmistha Purkaystha (wife of Surajit Kar Purkaystha) was found dead in her apartment. She was a member of our party and we demand an independent inquiry into her death,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.
Papia, who had suffered a fractured femur, had returned home from hospital 15 days ago. Some neighbours suspected they had Covid-19 and alerted the civic body.
Acting on an alert from the local councillor, chief medical officer of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Kusum Adhikary went to check on the women on Thursday. “Sharmistha could barely move while her mother was completely bedridden and did not respond when I called out to her,” Adhikary told Metro on Sunday. “Her temperature was normal. But she complained of feeling feverish, weak and drowsy.”
Adhikary said he had told the mayoral council member in charge of health, Pranay Kumar Ray, to get them admitted to hospital.
Ray said they had not shifted the women to a government-run hospital because of their “background” and the fact that they would be held responsible in case anything went wrong. “They are high profile. All the blame would have come on us if anything went wrong.”
Basab Aich, a resident of BE Block, said the women rarely interacted with neighbours. “The news of their deaths has sparked fear of infection among neighbours.”
On Sunday, a team of civic officials sanitised the house and the road in front of it.",states
"Covid-19 cases rise, as do tests & recoveries"," Bengal had yet another record-shattering day on Sunday with 449 new Covid-19 cases — the highest 24-hour rise — that took the total number of cases past 8,000.
This comes only two days after Bengal breached the 7,000 mark, five days since 6,000 and eight days since the milestone of 5,000.
The cases — 8,187, till 9am on Sunday — doubled from 4,000 in 12 days. The doubling from 2,000 had taken 15 days.
A month ago, the watershed moment of May 8, after which the return of migrant workers and others, stranded elsewhere in the country, started in large numbers, the figure was 1,678.
The 13 deaths reported on Sunday took the toll of deaths directly from Covid-19 to 324. There were, till April 30, 72 other deaths of infected people, attributed to comorbidities by the state government.

Of the 396 total deaths, Calcutta alone accounted for 254.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her government have repeatedly attributed the rise to the return of the stranded, the number of which has crossed over 10 lakh. Most are from high-incidence states, many are infected, and an alarming number are asymptomatic.
“Didi (Mamata) has been livid with the BJP-led Centre for rushing lakhs into the state in a matter of days, without planning, after keeping them stranded for months, without food, treatment, money or shelter…. Now, given the way they are being sent back, the (spread of) infection is virtually guaranteed,” said a minister.
Of the 449 new cases (till 9am on Sunday) 428 — over 95 per cent — were from districts experiencing a high volume of returnees. The total number of active Covid-19 cases is 4,488 now. On May 8, it was 1,195.
West Midnapore reported 84 cases, while Calcutta reported 74, North 24-Parganas reported 68, Howrah and Hooghly reported 37 each.
Bengal now has 11,806 quarantine facilities for returnees on Shramik Special trains, which now have 138,419 returnees, more than another 154,682 on home quarantine and 22,695 in other 582 state-run quarantines. On May 8, the state had 4,964 people in institutional quarantine and 9,576 people in home quarantine.
As of Sunday, 247,425 people successfully completed quarantine.
The release following the cure of 184 persons took the number of recoveries to 3,303. The number was 323 on May 8.
Another “good news”, according to the minister, was the rise in tests. With 9,786 tests reported on Sunday — yet another record in 24 hours — Bengal’s tests per million count went past the 3,000 mark. The total number of tests is 271,074.",states

He worked as a contract worker in Chennai on a daily wage of Rs 300 in an engineering plant.
Babloo claims the contractor who had him and others to Chennai has withheld their payments for April and May after the plant shut down in March because of the lockdown.

“Do mahine se payment nahin diya, kisi tarah hum log Jharkhand pahunche, par yahan bhi koi madad nahin mil raha (We were not paid salary for two months. We managed to reach Jharkhand somehow but even here there is no support),” said Babloo who returned on May 24 in a special Shramik train from Chennai to Ranchi.
He was taken to his village on a special bus from Ranchi and was kept in Uchha Vidyalaya in Kurun, Garhwa.
Similar is the condition of Mahto Munda in Rahada panchayat of Kanke block near Ranchi.
“I used to work as a labourer in Visakhapatnam and returned on May 20 by a special train. I am the only earning member and I used to send money for my parents. We were not paid a salary for April and May and had no option but to stay in home quarantine for 14 days.
“As I could not go outside because of the quarantine protocols, I had no option but to eat one time a day with whatever was available in the house. We had no option but to borrow money from known persons for our survival. There has been no government help apart from the free train service,” said Mahto, 25.
On May 13, Jharkhand home and disaster management department secretary Amitav Kaushal had written to deputy commissioners in all the 24 districts to ensure that a one-time dry ration food packet is given during home quarantine period. The dry ration packets would have included 10kg rice, 1kg arhar dal, 1kg chana dal, 1 litre mustard oil and 1kg salt.
“All those undergoing home quarantine had been advised to download the Jharkhand Bazar App so that dry ration packets would be provided at their home from their nearest ration shops. I do not know how the migrants could not get dry ration. We are yet to receive any specific complaints. However, we would look into the issue,” said Ranchi deputy development commissioner Ananya Mittal.
Repeated calls Garhwa deputy commissioner Harsh Mangla and deputy development commissioner Naman Priyesh Lakra on their mobile phones on Saturday went unanswered.
An advocate in Ranchi Anup Kumar Agarwal said he would be lodging a PIL in this connection at Ranchi High Court on Monday.
“We have collected details of several migrant workers from across Jharkhand who used to spend their home quarantine period in abject poverty because of the lack of government support. I would be filing a PIL in this connection at the high court on Monday,” said Agarwal.
Special secretary state disaster management Manish Tiwari promised to take up the issue with the respective deputy commissioners.
“We had asked all the deputy commissioners to ensure dry rations for migrants undergoing home quarantine. We would take up the issue with the district administration,” said Manish Tiwari.",states
Hiss! Slithery visitor at Burdwan quarantine centre," An unwelcome guest on Friday — a poisonous snake — in the toilet of a quarantine centre in East Burdwan’s Kalna, has rattled a group of 45 migrant workers, including two women, staying there.
The migrants, quarantined at a school building that has been turned into a quarantine centre, said the snake was a krait.
Since Friday night, the quarantined migrants have been demanding adequate lights and cleaning of the Haldipara RC High School building.
Quarantined inmate Indrajit Pal said he was spared a “sure snakebite” as he had switched on his mobile phone’s flashlight when he entered the toilet on Friday night. “I was barely two inches away from the snake. I was saved as I had turned on my phone’s flashlight in the absence of any light in the toilet. I am lucky to be alive,” Pal said.
He added that none of them at the quarantine centre had slept the night.

The Bengal state government has made it mandatory for migrants coming from five states, including Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat, to stay institutional quarantine for 14 days to contain the spread of Covid-19.
An official in Kalna said hundreds of school buildings had been acquired overnight for institutional quarantine after the flow of migrant workers returning to Bengal increased since mid-May.
“The schools remained closed since mid-March and had not been cleaned. As it is raining almost every day, snakes are trying to take shelter in such buildings. We have directed the local BDOs to ensure that the centres are free of snakes,” said the official.
A source said the 45 migrant workers institutionally quarantined at the Kalna’s Haldipara school since the past 10 days, had returned from states such as Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana.
“We did not come back to die of snakebite. The bathroom and a large part of the school campus don’t have lights. We informed the local panchayat member on this but nothing was done. We are just too scared,” said Rocky Mondal, who returned from Delhi 12 days ago.
Trinamul gram panchayat member Sanyasi Das admitted to the problem: “I have informed the local administration. There is a pond beside the school and I think snakes are coming from there.”
Kalna SDO Suman Sourav Mohanty said local block officials were looking into the problem.
However, the problem of snakes is not restricted to one quarantine centre. A migrant labourer, Biswajit Khara, was bitten by a poisonous snake at the Jadupur Primary School in West Midnapore and had to hospitalised on June 3 night. “He was saved as he was taken to the hospital within half an hour,” a health official said.
In both Kalna and West Midnapore, inmates managed to kill the snakes.
Suri resident Dinabandhu Biswas, a biology teacher and member of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, said rainwater forced snakes to wriggle out of their holes to look for shelter in dry places, including abandoned homes.",states
Help for job-hit train hawkers," Forty persons with visual impairment, many of them out-of-work hawkers on local trains, got a few days’ dry ration from two NGOs on Saturday.
People who depend on a day’s work for a day’s meal have been hit hard by the lockdown, which had come into force on March 25 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Among such people, the differently abled have been hit the hardest, said social workers who organised the aid on Saturday.
Pannalal Chakrabarty, 42, was one of the recipients. Chakrabarty, a resident of Durgapur in South 24-Parganas, was born with visual impairment and by the time he reached his teenage years, he was 100 per cent blind.
Chakrabarty and his wife Kanaklata, also blind, sold incense sticks on local trains between Sealdah and Ballygunge. With suburban train services suspended for over two months, the couple are done with stretching their little savings to the last penny.

“We used to earn Rs 150 to 200 every day. The savings we had is over. For the past two weeks, we have been living on help from NGOs,” said Chakrabarty.
Each recipient got a 15kg kit that contained rice, dal, potato, oil, soybean and biscuits. A pair of masks were also provided to each recipient.
“The stock should last a fortnight for a family of four,” said Chiranjit Gayen, a representative of Goonj, the NGO that provided the kits.
The recipients were selected by The Society for the Welfare of the Blind, a non-profit that works for the uplift of people with visual impairment.
“Many people who have lost their livelihood because of the lockdown are trying to make a living by switching professions. A mechanic is now selling vegetables. But blind people find it difficult to switch professions,” said Biswajit Ghosh, the secretary of the NGO. He is principal of the Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy in Narendrapur.
The NGO gave Rs 300 to each of the recipients.
The organisers went to several places in the city and its southern fringes — Baruipur, Garia, Tollygunge Phari, Ballygunge station, Kasba and Ultadanga — to distribute the kits on Saturday.
Debasish Das, 48, was one of the recipients of Saturday’s aid. A resident of Kalyanpur, the station after Baruipur in the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour section, Das supplies phenyl bottles to stalls at Jadavpur and Ballygunge stations.
“Some stores outside the station are open. But there is no way I can reach them without the train services,” said Das. “I worked hard for a living but there was a dignity in that life. Life dependent on charity is miserable,” he added.",states
Three-official panel on bus fares," The state government has set up a three-member committee to look into the demand for a hike in the fares of buses and minibuses.
The committee is made up of three officials of the transport department and the mandate is to look into all demands of the bus and minibus operators, including bringing workers within the insurance net and waiving fees for certain tests.
“The committee will start working from next week and will submit a report to the government within 30 days,” said an official of the transport department. “To begin with, the committee will start hearing out representatives from different bus and minibus unions.”

Buffer or clean zone? Find out online," A list identifying all Covid “affected”, “clean” and “buffer” areas in the city has been uploaded for the first time, helping Calcuttans figure out the specific restrictions and relaxations applicable to them and others at a time the lockdown is being eased.
The list of affected, clean and buffer areas can be found on wb.gov.in> district wise affected areas and buffer areas> know more> Kolkata.
Similar lists for the districts are also posted on the website.
Until now, only containment zones had been identified online. Now, the additional categories of “clean” and “buffer” are also specified.
The Bengal government has divided a Red Zone (any district from where at least one Covid-19 case has been reported) into affected areas, buffer areas and clean areas.
An area from where no Covid-19 case has been reported in 21 days is tagged clean, while one from where at least one case has been reported during this period is tagged affected.
The immediate vicinity of an affected area is called buffer area if it is not clean.
Relaxations of lockdown restrictions depend on whether a locality is in a clean, buffer or an affected area. No shop can be opened in an affected area/ containment zone and no one can enter or leave that area without a valid reason.
On the other hand, a large number of activities are allowed in clean areas. In buffer areas, all activities that are allowed in a clean area are permitted, but with 25 per cent staff strength.
Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the expanse of an affected area had been reduced for the benefit of people in the neighbourhood. As many offices have opened, the civic body and the police have jointly made a plan to ensure as few houses are sealed as possible.
If someone living in a housing complex with multiple towers test positive, only the tower where the person lives will be considered a containment zone or affected area. People living in this tower will remain confined in their homes for 14 days. Those living in other towers of the complex can go out for work, said an official.
The entire housing complex will be considered a buffer area.
For a large standalone building, the entire building where a person tests positive will be classified as an affected area but not the lanes around it or adjacent buildings.
In some cases, police and the CMC are considering only the flat or the floor as an affected area. Here the buffer area will include 10 buildings on all sides.
For a small standalone building, the entire lane will be classified as an affected area if the building where someone tests positive is in a small lane.
If the lane is quite long, five buildings on all sides will come under affected area. Ten buildings on all sides will be part of the buffer area.",states
"Bengal aims for 15,000 Covid-19 tests a day"," The state health department has decided to increase the number of daily Covid-19 tests from around 9,500 now to 15,000 by the end of this month, officials said.
Health department officials said there was a need for more tests because migrant workers had started returning in hordes from other states to different parts of Bengal.
A number of steps are being taken to ramp up Bengal’s testing capacity.
From next week, the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, which has been converted into a tertiary-level hospital to treat Covid-19 patients, will start conducting the RT-PCR test for the novel coronavirus.
“A formal approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research for the RT-PCR test at the laboratory set up at the College Street hospital reached the state government earlier this week. The medical college will start collecting samples from next week,” a health department official said.
Now, swab samples of patients admitted to the hospital are sent to the School of Tropical Medicine for tests.
“Once the new laboratory starts functioning, the School of Tropical Medicine will be ready to accept samples from other places. The detection of coronavirus cases at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital will now be faster,” the health department official said.
An RT-PCR machine was installed at SSKM Hospital three days back, taking the number of machines to detect the novel coronavirus in swab samples at the premier government referral hospital to three.
The machine that has been installed at SSKM was lying defunct at ESI Hospital in Maniktala. The health department brought in technicians from Chennai to get it repaired.
The hospital has been conducting over 1,000 tests every day, the highest followed by Niced Beleghata and the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri.
The health department has bought six RT-PCR machines, which will be distributed to various testing centres by next week. “The medical colleges in Diamond Harbour, Rampurhat and Cooch Behar will get one machine each,” an official said.
The health department has placed an order to buy a fully-automated testing machine from a US-based company that could carry out RNA extraction and test samples without any human intervention. Officials said the machine could perform over 3,000 tests every day.

"Infections, recoveries soar in Bengal"," Bengal on Saturday reported 435 new Covid-19 cases, a yet another 24-hour high.
However, the state also clocked a 24-hour high in daily testing, with 9,771 tests.
This apart, the total number of cured cases went past 3,000, with 207 releases till 9am, according to the state bulletin. The total number of cured cases rose to 3,119, a rise of 11 times since 296 a month ago.
The recovery rate — which more than doubled from 19.12 per cent a month ago — was 40.3 per cent on Friday. Even a week ago, it stood at 38.4 per cent. Calcutta reported the most recoveries, 1,073.
However, the 17 deaths reported on Saturday took the toll directly from Covid-19 past the 300 mark, to 311.
Of the 435 new cases, 419 or over 96 per cent were from districts with a high volume of migrant-worker returnees. Calcutta reported 94 new cases, neighbouring Hooghly, North 24-Parganas and Howrah 82, 60 and 56, respectively.
“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly attributed the spike, correctly, to the return of lakhs of migrant workers and others, especially from high-incidence states, over the past few weeks. Many of them have tested positive. It is entirely the responsibility of the Union railway ministry,” said a minister. The total cases on Saturday rose to 7,738, which was 5,130 a week ago and 1,548 a month ago.
“We, however, will do everything possible to take care of our returnee brothers and sisters,” he added.
Bengal now has 11,716 quarantine facilities for returnees on Shramik Special trains, with 1,39,488 people. This is over and above another 1,52,173 in home quarantine and 22,669 in the other 582 state-run quarantine facilities.
“The good news is 2.34 lakh have successfully completed quarantine. Of the 3.14 lakh people in quarantine now, another lakh will have completed it successfully in a week or so,” said the minister.
With the rise in cases, the occupancy in the 8,785 Covid-19 beds — in the 69 dedicated hospitals — also rose to 20.17 per cent, from 13.27 per cent a month ago.
The 9,771 tests reported on Saturday took Bengal’s tests per million count to 2,903. The total number of tests rose to 2,61,288. A month ago, Bengal was recording around 2,600 tests a day. However, the positive confirmation rate rose from 2.64 a week ago to 2.96 per cent now, indicative of higher levels of Covid-19 spread.

Camera detecting body temperature cuts queue at Calcutta airport," Domestic fliers arriving at the Calcutta airport now don’t have to stand in long queues to get their body temperature checked by hand-held devices or fill in a self-declaration form.
Thermal and optical imaging cameras to detect body temperature have been installed near three gates in the arrival area and outside one entrance at the departure level of the airport, officials said.
The camera is grabbing the image of a passenger passing in front of it and the body temperature and thermal image of that person is shown on the monitor placed along with the camera. The doctor sitting in front of the screen can see the thermal image and the body temperature reading of the passenger.
If the image is white, it would mean the person has temperature above normal. He or she will be taken to a hospital for a Covid-19 test or advised quarantine.
Airport officials said the cameras had been installed near gate numbers 3A, 3B and 1B in the arrival section and near gate number 3C in the departure section, airport officials said.
One camera has been installed for international arrival passengers before the immigration clearance.
The state government has installed the cameras and handed over to the airport authorities for maintenance.
Now, 60 domestic flights are arriving in Calcutta every day on an average with 9,000-odd passengers. Airport officials said initially there were long queues of passengers who needed to fill in the self-declaration form and also get their body temperature checked with a hand-held device.
It took about half an hour for a passenger to leave the airport after arrival because of the congestion. Airport officials said it was becoming difficult to ensure social distancing when so many passengers were queuing up.
“We had requested the state government to install thermal cameras which would help ease the congestion. Now, the passengers can just collect luggage from the conveyor belt and walk out of the terminal,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.
He said one camera was installed in the departure area as a pilot project to see whether it could be used at other gates. During departure, the passengers have to stand in queues to get their baggage sanitised, body temperature checked and then tickets and ID proof checked remotely through a camera.
“We have to see whether installing a camera can actually help reduce queue at the entry gate to the departure area, said Bhattacharya.
Similar cameras have been installed at other airports, including the ones in Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram, officials said.
At the Calcutta airport, arrival passengers no longer have to fill in a self-declaration form. “The passengers are already filling in the form online. Airlines are issuing the form during ticket booking. So, we had requested the state government to do away with the system of filling in the form at the airport after arrival,” director Bhattacharya said.
The new system kicked in on Monday.
“Apart from taking time, multiple touches were involved when a passenger was filling up the form,” he said.",states
Old habits die hard for Meghalaya drug users," Fears of return to drug use and overdose cases among users have been preying on the minds of medical practitioners and activists here following the opening up of activities after a long-drawn lockdown.
The lockdown had reportedly brought about a positive change among drug users here.
“There were many drug users who had turned to opiate substitution therapy and detoxification during the lockdown since the supply was low and the street price of heroin hit the roof,” Meghalaya Users’ Forum president Neil J. Khongwir told The Telegraph.
He said around 550 drug users had taken the therapy from three institutions during the lockdown period. All of these were new to the therapy.
Khongwir said these were also injecting drug users. Heroin is the major drug being used in Meghalaya, and it came at a high price during the lockdown.
Heroin is packed in pieces of paper commonly referred to as puria (packets). The street value of each puria during the lockdown had touched Rs 2,000, he said.
“Many drug users would need around three purias a day. The price was too high for many who could not afford. Even when the price was high, the heroin was not pure. It was adulterated with substances like Rasna powder and Paracetamol tablets in order to increase the quantity,” Khongwir said.
However, with the recent ease in restrictions, the price of each puria had dropped to Rs 1,000, he said. During the pre-lockdown period, the price was not more than Rs 250 to Rs 300 per puria.
Rica Lamar of the Manbha Foundation, which works with drug users, said the fear now is on two counts – drug users returning to their old habits, and cases of overdose.
“I have had many users who came to me for detoxification and medication during the lockdown. There were some who were admitted into rehabilitation centres too. But now, we fear that many of them could return to drug addiction, and we could receive cases of drug overdose,” Lamar, a medical practitioner, said.
To counter drug overdose, she said that the foundation would train their outreach workers and staff to administer Naloxone to those who would need the medication.
Naloxone is commonly used to counter decreased breathing in opioid overdose.
The lockdown had given a chance to many drug users to change, and it was also an opportunity for family members to know and understand what their loved ones who are using drugs were going through, Lamar said.
The Telegraph also caught up with two youths, who are in their twenties, and who had recently gave up drug use to start life afresh.
The youths explained the hazards involved due to drug use, and the significance of will power to change for the better.
“I suffered a lot. It was like hell for me. Each day, I needed heroin packed in one tin of golden tobacco for personal use. Had I been a drug user during the lockdown, I would have faced difficulties. But for the past five months, I had given up, and am on medication,” one of them who had been using drugs for five years said.
Meghalaya police, especially in East Khasi Hills and East Jaintia Hills districts, have been proactive in cracking down drug supply. There have been several seizures of heroin and meth tablets worth crores of rupees.",states
Oil India for blowout death claim probe," Oil India Ltd on Saturday appealed to the Tinsukia administration to probe the reported death of four persons from a nearby village allegedly because of pollution caused by the May 27 oil well blowout.
Oil India has also requested the administration to engage 20 local fishermen to “identify oil spill, if any” in the affected Baghjan area so that immediate action can be taken.
The company took the steps on a day the affected people organised a four-hour dharna from 11am seeking immediate implementation of their demands, including capping of the oil well that is oozing natural gas and condensate, and disbursal of emergency cash relief to tide over their losses.
OIL India had on Friday announced a compensation of Rs 30,000 for each affected family after the district administration submits a list of such people. The decision was taken at a tripartite meeting involving the local deputy commissioner and representatives of the affected people. The list is likely to be ready by Monday.
Earlier, the company had said that based on figures provided by the district authorities, 1,610 families had been evacuated to four relief camps.
A senior Oil India official told The Telegraph that they were having to contend with inclement weather and unsubstantiated reports about death and destruction. It has been raining in the area for the past three days.
“We don’t want to join issue with anyone because it will be our word against theirs. We are focused on capping the gas leak and compensating those who have suffered due to the blowout. We have urged a neutral person (deputy commissioner) to verify the cause of the deaths and also submit the headcount of the affected so that we can extend emergency relief,” the official said.
A situational report issued subsequently by Oil India said gas and condensates continued to flow uncontrollably from the well but that “utmost care has been taken to arrest condensate spillage to surrounding areas” and that a “bund has been created around the well site to prevent the contaminated water runoff to surrounding and nearby water body”.
Oil India also said that “poor” weather was hampering activities related to movement of men and machines and development of an approach road for removing equipment from the site.
The company has engaged local fishermen with boats to identify oil spill, if any, at Maguri Matapung Beel (a lake) so that immediate remedial action can be taken. A Guwahati-based firm has been engaged for bio-remediation of the oil spill, the Oil India statement said.
On moving the district administration for a neutral probe, the statement said the step was taken to ascertain the real cause of the deaths following local media reports “ that four persons have died in Natun Gaon (a nearby village) possibly due to pollution from the blowout”.
Several affected people had told this newspaper that the “condensate” or chemical spray from the blowout had adversely affected nearby water bodies, tea gardens, betel groves, crop fields and livestock, apart from birds, in the eco-sensitive area.
The continuous, ear-splitting noise — like that of an airplane taking off — and the air pollution that caused breathing difficulties have forced the evacuation of the villagers.Oil India has asserted that no human life has been lost due to the release of natural gas, crude oil spillage or condensate because of the company’s operations over the years.
“There are 24/7 paramedical staff at the relief camps and doctors are constantly addressing the health issues of the local people staying in the relief camps or visiting the mobile health camps in the relief camps. As on date, there is no report of any such very serious health issues due to the blowout,” the statement said.
The Oil India official said around 250 of its employees, including those on contract, were working at the site and nobody had complained of any serious health issues except itching in the eyes at the site. He said that at the most, people living within 1.5km of the site would be affected to some extent by the blowout.
Hemanta Moran, who participated in Saturday’s dharna, said nobody had died in Baghjan and that Natun Gaon was about 2.5km from the site of the blowout. “We are also hearing about the deaths and that they had health issues. The overall situation remain unchanged,” he said. He said a dharna would be held every day at the relief camp till their demands were met. ",states
Best of the North East region awaits cinema buffs,"  Some of the best films from the Northeast will be screened during the third edition of Guwahati International Film Festival (GIFF), which starts in the city from October 31.
The seven-day festival, organised by the Assam government-owned Jyoti Chitraban, in association with Dr Bhupen Hazarika Regional Government Film and Television Institute, will be held at the three auditoriums at Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra and one at Jyoti Chitraban.
Speaking about the films to be screened during GIFF, festival director Monita Borgohain said they have chosen some of the best in the country and abroad, besides films from the Northeast.
“Normally, we can watch films from different countries on various platforms but hardly get to watch our own films. This festival will provide a platform to watch the best contemporary films made in our region. There are some talented filmmakers in the region who have been doing excellent work,” Borgohain told The Telegraph.
Among the films screened will be Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus) winners like Bulbul Can Sing (Assamese) by Rima Das, In the Land of Poison Women (in Pangchenpa dialect of Arunachal Pradesh) by Manju Borah, Ma’ama (Garo) by Dominic Sangma and Mishing (in Sherdukpan dialect of Arunachal Pradesh) by Bobby Sarma Baruah.
Aamis by Bhaskar Hazarika, which recently won two awards at the third edition of Singapore South Asian International Film Festival, will have its Assam premiere. Jwlwi — The Seed, a Bodo language film by Rajni Basumatary, who played Mary Kom’s mother in her biopic, will also have its world premiere. The film deals with the struggle of families who lost their near and dear ones when insurgency was at its peak in Assam and in other parts of the Northeast. “Besides, we are lucky to have Aribam Syam Sharma’s latest film Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi (The Guest), which will have its world premiere,” Borgohain added.
In the Land of Poison Women is based in Arunachal Pradesh, near the border of China-administered Tibet. It deals with the blind belief in the Pangchenpa community that women have poison in their nails and when they serve food to the males, the latter die immediately or slowly.
Dominic Sangma’s debut feature film Ma’ama narrates the story of Philip Sangma who is searching for his dead wife, Anna.
Mishing deals with the folklore of the Sherdukpen people.",states
Prepaid cabs from LGBI to rest of North East region capitals,"  Prepaid taxi service covering the entire Northeast has been launched from Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International (LGBI) Airport here on Thursday.
The taxi services were inaugurated at the airport by Guwahati (West) MLA Ramendra Narayan Kalita, Airports Authority Of India (AAI) regional executive director Sanjeev Jindal, airport director Ramesh Kumar, and other officials of the state police department.
Addressing the media about the new taxi services in his constituency, Kalita said it was a historic move by the AAI and the police department where a prepaid service for the passengers travelling through Guwahati airport has been launched for the first time in the Northeast.
“The launching of this prepaid taxi service will help boost tourism, provide jobs to local people and benefit passengers coming to Assam and the Northeast as Guwahati is a door for tourism in the state and one should get services right at the airport for all types of conveniences,” he said.
Along with connecting with the capitals of the northeastern states, the prepaid taxi service is also scheduled to cover small distances of upto 0.5km. Airport authorities said the taxi service would also connect Bhutan.
Jindal, while expressing concern for the local taxi drivers and tour operators, said, “Their interests will also be kept in consideration as they are also one of the main stakeholders in operating the cab services for Guwahati airport. It will offer competitive rates and a healthy atmosphere for all taxi drivers with ample space for extending services to other locations. The AAI will also provide basic amenities to taxi operations at the parking area like seating shed, toilets, drinking water and assistance booths.”
“I request the taxi drivers, tour operators and stakeholders concerned to keep the parking area clean. We have witnessed over 27 per cent growth in the passenger movement from this airport and there are lots of opportunities for further growth here,” Kumar said.
“As international flights have started their services from LBGI Airport, more cabs will be added according to the requirement and timing of the flights,” he said.
A pre-paid taxi service booking counter is available at the arrival area of the airport and the taxi can be booked and hired from the city side of the arrival gate, a press release said.",states
Jamshedpur bullish on night curfew," The steel city, which started reporting Covid-19 cases from the second week of May, has put the administration on high alert.
Till lockdown 3.0, grocery, fruit, milk and vegetable shops remained open in the steel city well past 7pm as they came under the essential items.
Not any more.
Now, all shops selling essential commodities, except medicine stores, will have to down shutters in the city at 7pm when the night curfew kicks in.
City SP Subhash Chandra Jatt said a directive has been issued to all police stations and the patrolling personnel on jeeps and bikes to ensure that all essential shops such as grocery, vegetable and fruit shops are closed after 7pm. “Only medicine stores, dispensaries and health centres will remain open after 7pm in view of the home ministry directive on night curfew,” said the SP.
“The directive of Union home ministry clearly underlines that only for exceptional emergencies can people be allowed on roads between 7pm and 7am,” added city SP.
East Singhbhum administration has made it clear that companies operating in city areas will not be allowed to open. “The directive by the state government is quite clear that companies will only be allowed to function outside municipal corporation areas. In Jamshedpur most big companies are located inside the city and won’t be allowed to function till May 31,” said DC Ravi Shankar Shukla.
He added that they were following state orders such as allowing shops selling construction materials, storehouses (godowns), hardware shops, book and stationery shops and retail outlets of telecom firms to open in both urban and rural areas. However, shops selling mobiles, watches, consumer electronic appliances allowed to open only in panchayat (rural) areas. Private firms have been allowed to open with 30 per cent attendance.",states
Calcutta students share dengue tips," Groups of schoolchildren went door to door in their neighbourhoods to create awareness on how to keep their surroundings clean and prevent dengue.
Students of Sri Sri Academy and Apeejay School Park Street visited slums near their schools and urged residents not to store water for several days, leave stored water uncovered and let water stagnate. They also asked everyone to use mosquito nets and repellents.
Students of Bhavan’s Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir in Salt Lake interacted with children of the neighbourhood slums and spoke to them about cleanliness.
Groups of eight students from classes VIII to XII at Sri Sri Academy visited three homes and two stores around Chetla over 10 days. They handed over “meaningful hampers” containing articles such as mosquito nets, phenyl, repellents and cloth bags.
Dengue has claimed several victims in the city this season. The dengue-causing Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds in fresh water.
The students’ campaign was aimed at sensitising people and bringing about a change in their attitude.
“The children told the residents of the areas they visited to maintain hygiene because many of them are not aware of cleanliness standards or the consequences of not meeting them,” said Suvina Shunglu, the principal of Sri Sri Academy.
“We told them not to throw waste on the road but in dustbins, which should be cleared in vats,” said Samridhi Rajgaria, a Class IX student of Sri Sri Academy and a member of the school’s Interact Club.
The teachers said such interactions with the community help students come out of the “bubble” they live in.
“The idea of giving repellents was to create awareness and make our children realise what they have studied filters down to people who perhaps have never gone to school,” said Radhika Bagadthey, the teacher-in-charge of the Interact Club of Sri Sri Academy.
Students also spoke about the need to cut down on the use of plastic.
The students of the Interact Club of Apeejay School Park Street visited three slums in the neighbourhood to speak to them about clean habits and use of mosquito nets as protection against dengue.
“The children from these homes come to the schools’ Anand Children’s Library for regular classes and our students thought of visiting their homes to sensitise
their parents or guardians about dengue,” said

Kasba godown in flames," A fire broke out in a godown stacked with electrical items on RK Chatterjee Road in Kasba, spreading panic among residents in the congested locality.
Three fire tenders took over an hour to control the blaze. Police have started a case against the owner, Tarak Dutta.
The godown — used for storing pedestal fans, generators, wires and plugs — has been sealed.
Residents said they spotted thick black fumes coming out of the godown, located on a small plot next to a pond and surrounded by highrises, around 10am.
Some youths swung into action, trying to douse the flames with water fetched from the pond. Others alerted the fire services department.
“Two youths had opened the godown and set wires on fire outside. They do that almost every day to extract copper from the wires. It appears a spark from the fire had landed inside the godown,” an officer of Kasba police station said.
Within minutes, the godown was engulfed in flames.
A number of residents said they had been protesting for some time against the practice of setting fire to cables outside the godown.
Fire operators said the lone generator inside the godown did not have any fuel.
“Had the generator contained fuel, the blaze would have been uncontrollable,” a fire-fighter said.
Anandapur fire
A fire broke out at a plastic godown in Anandapur’s Chowbagha on the southern fringe of the city on Friday around 9.30pm, reports PTI.
Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot.
“The situation is under control but we are trying
to douse the fire so it does
not spread further,” police said.
No one was trapped or injured.",states
Phonta in return of new life," The 30-year old woman who underwent a heart transplant surgery on Thursday gave bhai phonta to the doctors with powdered paracetamol on Friday.
Tanaya Pandit from Raghunathganj in Murshidabad was in the operating theatre between 3.45am and 5am on Thursday and regained consciousness around 9am on Friday. She was taken off ventilation soon after and surprised everyone with her first wish — she wanted to give bhai phonta to the doctors at Fortis Hospital Anandapur.
“We were extremely surprised that she actually
remembered which day it was so soon after being taken off ventilation and even remembered it was Bhai Phonta,” said cardiac surgeon Tapas Raychaudhury, who along with surgeon K.M. Mandana had led the team of doctors that
conducted the surgery on Thursday.
In the absence of chandan (sandalwood paste) and kajal, traditionally used to give phonta, the nurses of the isolation room in the intensive care unit, where Tanaya is recuperating, ground a paracetamol tablet and created a paste with water for her to give a phonta to Raychaudhury around 1pm and Mandana a couple of hours later.
“She did all this 30 hours after the surgery and just three hours after being taken off ventilation, which is remarkable for a recipient in a heart transplant,” said Raychaudhury.
Tanaya, who has done her post graduation in economics from Visva-Bharati, has been suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart muscles loosen and its pumping capacity reduces, since 2010 and doctors had said heart transplant was the only answer.
Tanaya’s blood parameters were stable and pulmonary artery pressure normal on Friday. Immuno-suppresants have been introduced so that the body does not reject the new heart, doctors said.
Raychaudhury attributed her initial speedy recovery to her age and the fact that the transplanted heart was a perfect match. But she must be kept under strict monitoring to guard her from infections, he said.
“Being young, all her other organs were very healthy. So, we were sure that if the heart transplant surgery went well, she would recover sooner than others,” said Raychaudhury.
Something else that went in Tanaya’s favour was a perfect match with her donor, Debolina Ghosh from Sonarpur, who had been declared brain dead at AMRI Hospitals Dhakuria on Wednesday.
Ghosh, 25, and Pandit, 30, were in the same age group.
“The blood groups of the donor and recipient have to match but in this case some of the sub-groups also matched which was a good indicator,” Raychaudhury said.",states
Concern over Id-ul-Fitr shopping crowds," The Dhubri district Youth Congress committee on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal demanding closure of all garment and footwear shops in this lower Assam town with immediate effect.
The move came after huge crowds thronged markets across Dhubri district for Id shopping after the deputy commissioner, in an order on May 14, allowed opening of cloth, garment and footwear shops on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, following the removal of the orange zone tag from the district.
In the memorandum submitted to Sonowal through deputy commissioner Anant Lal Gyani, the Youth Congress alleged that the decision of the district administration amid the coronavirus pandemic had attracted unnecessary crowds in the markets, hampering the norms of social distancing and also increasing the chance of infection.
According to the memorandum, the district had five Covid-19 patients and nearly 5,000 migrant labourers and students have been put in quarantine.
They said when Covid-19 cases are increasing across the country, if the crowding in Dhubri markets was not curbed, then the people will soon have to cope with the pandemic.
Huge crowds thronged the hawkers’ market here, with customers standing or sitting close together. There are nearly 100 readymade garments shops in the market spread over less than 100 metres.
“We are well aware about the pandemic, but the children won’t listen. We don’t want to break their hearts. After all it’s Id,” said one of the shoppers.
A shopkeeper alleged the customers refused to follow the social distancing norms.
This unprecedented crowd in the markets of Dhubri district amid the pandemic has raised serious concern among the common people.
Earlier, Dhubri MP and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal had appealed to the people not to throng the markets for Id shopping.
A police officer said, “All shopkeepers and customers must follow the norms for their own safety. Otherwise, we will have to face a terrible situation in the coming days.”
He said the shops have been instructed to allow only a particular number of customers at a time and also to provide them hand-washing facilities and sanitisers.
Relaxation has been given for the benefit of the public, so they have to follow the minimum social distancing norms and should avoid going to the markets unless necessary, he said.",states
"Pray at home, says Guwahati mosque"," Ghar pe namaz (pray at home) is the message the city’s oldest mosque, Burha Jame Masjid, is giving the faithful this Id, having decided not to hold public prayers on its premises this year in view of the people’s safety amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Id ul-Fitr is likely to be observed on May 25 (depending on the sighting of the moon).
The mosque committee took the decision on Tuesday after it observed that confusion was brewing among Muslims in the city following lockdown relaxations.
Nizamul Haque, general secretary of the Burha Jame Masjid, told The Telegraph, “With lockdown 4.0 easing public movement, many in the community thought that they will be able to offer namaz on Id day with social restrictions. But we don’t want any such confusion to exist. So we have decided not to hold public prayers this Id for the safety of all. For now, it’s important to observe social distancing strictly. We want everyone to pray at home.”
The committee appealed to all other mosque committees in the state to follow suit and also requested Muslims to refrain from extensive Id shopping. In several parts of the state people were seen going on a shopping spree, throwing all caution, such as social distancing norms, to the winds. Parents were seen shopping in crowded places with their children.
“It’s time to pray for a better future for the entire human race. If we can overcome this crisis, we will get enough opportunity to celebrate in future. But going shopping in defiance of all safety norms is not advisable. We urge everyone to stay away from gatherings,” Haque added.
AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal also said in a video message that shopping on a grand scale would only lead to disaster.
Of the state’s 154 Covid cases so far, over 20 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin in Delhi.
Meanwhile, a massive sanitisation drive is on in the city’s Fancy Bazar area. The market has mostly remained closed for the past six days since the detection of several cases from the area but a few shops have opened in the vicinity.
On Tuesday, the Kamrup (metro) district administration declared parts of two other areas of the city — Biharipatty at Bhutnath and Bishnupur at Fatasil — containment zones after positive cases were detected in the areas.",states
Licence to a homemade heady brew in Shillong," The lockdown to combat Covid-19 and the resultant economic downturn has prodded innovative ideas to seek a turnaround in fortunes.
Remember Nancy Sinatra crooning about strawberries and cherries in her summer wine? The Meghalaya government had adopted a campaign to legalise such fruity tipples 18 years ago, but it is only now that it has evinced interest to issue licences for manufacture and sale of homemade fruit wine.
The Conrad K. Sangma government plans to promote homemade fruit wine and encourage their sale in the domestic and international markets.
It was in 2002 that the Shillong Wine Festival made its foray, and since then, homemade fruit wine producers have been asking the government to legalise the trade.
Michael N. Syiem, who has been at the forefront to organise the festival and demand legalisation of the trade, on Tuesday said fruit wine making should be in the form of small or cottage industry.
“It has been a long campaign with more and more people taking to wine-making at home. During the annual festival, not less than 20 homemade fruit wine makers set up their stalls. We want the winemaking in the form of small or cottage industries as this will create employment and also increase the variety,” Syiem said.
In Meghalaya, wine is prepared from grapes, sohiong (blackberries), strawberry, pear, peach, pineapple, dates, guava, sohphie nam (myrica nagi), plum, passion fruit, watermelon and mulberry, as well as from coffee, orange, ginger, coconut, tomato, hibiscus, rice, celery and green tea.
The government has issued the draft rules for issuing licence for homemade wines by individuals, firms, societies and others.
The holder of the licence for production and sale of homemade wines will be allowed to store and sell his/her finished wines at the production centre, but sales to retail “on” and “off” licence holders should be accompanied by a permit issued by the deputy commissioner.
The licence holder will have to pay in advance an annual fee of Rs 7,500 for the production and sale of potable homemade wines at the designated winery.
Homemade wines can be sold at the winery and Retail ”on” and “off” licenced premises on pre-payment of all government levies.
The draft rules have prescribed that the strength of the homemade wines should not exceed 14 per cent ABV (alcohol by volume).
Moreover, it has been prescribed that the type of yeasts, fruits, the quantity used are to be declared to the deputy commissioner before the process of fermentation is undertaken, batchwise.
Every batch will be allowed to be sold only after certification from chemical examiner/chemist, stationed at the State Excise Chemical Laboratory, or any laboratory in recognised university/institute or any registered laboratory, showing the strength and quality of the wine.
Spoilt or sedimented wine will have to be destroyed in the presence of an excise officer and levies will then be waived.
The government has invited stakeholders to share their views and suggestions on the draft rules, and these have to be sent on or before June 9.
For now, Syiem said that homemade winemakers are looking forward to the government’s final decision.",states

Robbers raid iron plant in Durgapur & confine guards," A gang of nearly 30 armed robbers raided an iron factory in Durgapur town on Thursday night, beat up three security guards and confined them to a room.
The goons brandishing revolvers and iron rods decamped with iron products like manhole covers from the factory on Raturia-Angadhpur industrial estate in the Coke Oven police station area.
“We are yet to estimate the value of the stolen products as the plant is closed on the occasion of Diwali and Bhai Phonta. But as of now, we can say the dacoits have looted a large number of finished products like iron manhole covers kept at the plant,” said Keshari Nandan, the manager of Kajaria Iron and Steel Company Pvt Ltd.
Sources said the plant — a part of Kajaria group — produces iron manhole covers and frames, iron ingots and pig iron moulds and has customers in both domestic and global market.
The security guards said they had become alert after some dogs inside the plant suddenly started barking around 11.30pm. “We started patrolling around the boundary wall of our plant with torch lights but found nothing,” said Umapada Sinha, one of the security guards.
Suddenly, they heard some people speaking from inside a bush. “When we approached, a group of young men armed with rods and guns emerged from the bush and chased us. We were unarmed and were helpless,” said Sajal Ruidas, another security guard.
The goons beat them up and later confined them to a room inside the plant.
One of them said they saw the miscreants passing the iron products over the boundary wall.
The guards somehow managed to break the lock and come out of the room after the goons left and called the police.
The police arrived at the spot within 10 minutes and started an investigation.
Police suspect the robbers packed the looted iron products on a waiting truck outside the plant and fled after finishing the half an hour operation. The police found tyre marks on the field outside the boundary wall which indicates presence of a truck.
Local people said the police usually patrol the industrial belt at night but on Thursday night, they did not see any police patrol team. They alleged that policemen were busy enjoying a folk song programme organised on the occasion of Kali puja near Coke Oven police station. The police, however, denied the charge.
“Primarily, we came to know that the miscreants are based in the locality. Investigation is on and the gang will be arrested soon. Our police team reached the spot soon after we received information,” said Abhishek Modi, deputy commissioner of police (east).",states
Bengal 4 boast Number 10 jerseys," A premier football club in Germany, Eintracht Frankfurt, has honoured a Darjeeling player and three others from Bengal by handing them its official Number 10 jerseys with their names emblazoned.
The four footballers’ talents were discovered by Bengal police which held different soccer tournaments across the state early this year.
For any footballer, Number 10 jersey is the most coveted possession.
The four players — Manish Subba (Pulbazar near Darjeeling), Debkumar Khirali (Lalgarh) and Calcutta boys Loknath Mondal and Sekh Rintu — come from humble backgrounds and their parents do odd-jobs for a living.
Facilitated by Football Next Foundation based in Calcutta, the players are currently on a training-cum-exposure trip to Germany.
Kaushik Moulik, the founder of the Foundation, told The Telegraph over the phone from Frankfurt: “Eintracht Frankfurt decided to honour the Bengal boys by handing them the club’s official Number 10 jerseys with their names printed on them. It was a huge honour for the four.”
The officials of the club presented the jerseys to the players at the home stadium; Commerzbank-Arena, on Wednesday.
Speaking to The Telegraph over the phone from Frankfurt, Subba said: “It was an out-of-this-world experience to receive an official Number 10 jersey with one’s name on it.”
The footballers who reached Germany on November 7 said they were learning new things every moment.
“On the first day, they took us for a tour of the club’s stadium and museum and explained to us how the German football system and the club function,” said Subba, 23. “During the tour, I felt they were basically trying to judge how passionate we are about the game. They were trying to analyse us on different parameters, including our passion for soccer.”
According to Moulik, the Bengal players were told about success stories of footballers from countries like Bosnia, who made a mark in Bundesliga. “The boys also trained with Nicolai Adam (former U-17 coach of Indian football club),” said Moulik.
The Bengal quartet has also
trained with Eintracht Frankfurt’s players and are learning the game’s strategies and techniques. The German club, which was founded on March 8, 1899, is currently playing in Bundesliga, which is the top tier
of the German football league system and placed 7th in the 18-team league tournament.
Darjeeling police, which discovered Subba, also decided to organise a football tourney for students in the age group 10-12 from December 7. Sources said a pool of 20 students would be drawn up and given three years of training, during which they would also be sent to the German club for training.
“What I have found out is that players in the hills are dreaming big. They have dreams to play in English Premier League and Bundesliga and want to be associated with top clubs like FC Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. This is the kind of passion and dream we are looking for,” said Moulik.",states
"Calcutta Metro gives Rs 25,000 as ex gratia to 5 with fractures"," Five passengers who suffered fractures in the melee resulting from the Metro fire on Thursday got Rs 25,000 each on Tuesday in what a railway official described as a “much-needed gesture”.
The five passengers received calls from the office of the chief operations manager before Metro officials visited their homes to hand over the cash.
The callers apologised for the trouble caused to the passengers and promised all possible help in their rehabilitation.
The Metro authorities had come in for a lot of flak for not apologising to the passengers and for not coming out with an offer of compensation.
“The money given on Tuesday was ex gratia, not compensation,” chief operations manager Satyaki Nath said. “It was a much-needed gesture.”
Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines ex gratia as “given or done as a gift or favour, not because there is a legal duty to do it”.
Nath said handing out ex gratia payments was the norm after railway accidents.
Manoj Bhagat, one of those who received the payment, welcomed the move but expressed the hope that it was the beginning and not the end.
The 27-year-old fractured both his legs after he jumped out through a window of the second coach of the Dum Dum-bound train that caught fire minutes after it had pulled out of Rabindra Sadan station.
Several passengers jumped out of the train after smashing windowpanes to escape the smoke that filled up multiple compartments.
Bhagat, who works at a chartered accountancy firm and freelances as a tax consultant, has been advised “bed rest” for at least five months.
“I am almost out of work. I need compensation,” he told the Metro official who had come calling at his sister’s home in Howrah’s Ramrajatala with the money.
“My elder brother is epileptic and has other medical conditions. My mother would not have been able to take care of both of us together. That is why my sister brought me here.”
Bhagat’s sister told the official that his brother, who has both his legs in cast, could not even go to the bathroom on his own.
The official told the family that he was not authorised to speak on compensation but advised Bhagat to file the documents related to his treatment.
“A list of 12 passengers has been drawn up under the supervision of the chief medical officer. Five of them who suffered grievous injuries are entitled to Rs 25,000 each. Those with simple injuries are entitled to Rs 5,000 each,” Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said.
Three of the seven passengers who suffered “simple injuries” were handed Rs 5,000 each during the day. “The other passengers are out of station. They will receive the payment once they are back,” said Banerjee.",states
Calcutta cops seize 200 bikes for rule flout on 31st night," Riding without helmets, rash driving and other violation of road rules resulted in seizure of over 200 motorcycles from Park Street and adjacent roads on New Year’s Eve.
In previous years, riders were allowed to walk away with their two-wheelers after they were made to pay a fine or their licences were seized.
This New Year’s Eve, police in the Park Street area seized the vehicles to deny them an opportunity to repeat the offence while the revelry was still on.
People whose two-wheelers were seized lined up under the Park Street flyover on Tuesday morning to pay the fine and claim their vehicles.
Many of those whose bikes were seized were repeat-offenders and had multiple cases of traffic rule violation pending against them. Officers of the South Traffic Guard told them they would get their vehicles back only after clearing their dues.
A number of “repeat offenders” had to cough up thousands of rupees before they were handed the keys to their vehicles.
A senior officer said this was the first time such a drive had been undertaken against “unruly bikers” on a festive occasion.
“The idea was to set an example. We have seen that bikers, once prosecuted on a festive day, tend to assume that they would not be prosecuted for the same offence again the same day. Hence, they keep violating rules. So, this year we decided to seize bikes,” a senior officer at Lalbazar said.
Usually, the maximum number of traffic rule violations are reported from Park Street, Park Circus, Camac Street, AJC Bose Road flyover and the Parama flyover. The majority of offenders has always been bikers.
“The drive against errant bikers was launched in certain pockets of south Calcutta where people gather to party in large number on occasions such as New Year’s Eve and where violation of traffic rules, often under the influence of alcohol, is rampant,” an officer said.
A section of officers pointed out that booking revellers for violating traffic rules without marring the festive spirit was difficult.
“During festivals it is important to profile the people at fault. People should not feel harassed. For example, bikers without helmets but travelling with family were let off with a warning. But youths speeding without helmets were intercepted and their vehicles seized.
“There were instances of errant bikers escaping cops at one signal but getting caught at the next,” an officer in south Calcutta said.
Police sources said news of two-wheelers being seized on and around Park Street spread by word of mouth, making others cautious.
“We are sure that if we had intercepted 200 bikers and seized their vehicles, the news must have stopped another 100 from breaking the law,” the officer added.
The seized two-wheelers were kept on the ground floor of Chatterjee International Centre, from where their owners could collect them after paying the fine at the South Traffic Guard office under the Park Street flyover.",states
BJP to form Jharkhand government with absolute majority: Rudy," Asserting that the BJP would win with an absolute majority in Jharkhand, the party's national spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said people would cast votes in favour of 'good governance and political stability'.
He insisted that the double-engine government of the BJP at the Centre and the state would ensure an all-round development of Jharkhand.
'The BJP has a long-term vision for the development of the state. If the governments at the Centre and the state are the same then development becomes easier,' Rudy told reporters here on Saturday.
Listing the achievements of the Raghubar Das government, he said the saffron party has worked for tribal welfare, infrastructure development and agricultural growth over the past five years.
'I, too, had voted in favour of Jharkhand's statehood when the proposal was placed (in Parliament). But the irony was that after its creation, there was no political stability for several years. The state saw a person without any ideology or party becoming the chief minister,' Rudy said, referring to former Independent MLA Madhu Koda's tenure from 2006 to 2008.
The BJP, however, has given a stable government to Jharkhand over the last five years, the BJP MP said.
'This time, too, people will vote for stability and good governance. The BJP will form a government in Jharkhand with absolute majority,' he stated.
The senior BJP leader said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had always taken a 'keen interest' in the development of the state.
'The decisions taken by Modi and his government has always has had a positive effect on the states and the country as a whole -- be it abrogation of Article 370 or ban on triple talaq,' he said.
Taking a dig at the Opposition alliance of the JMM, the Congress and the RJD, he said, 'Parties functioning around their families can never work for the state's growth.'
He said that Raghubar Das during the second of the five-phase assembly elections, would win with a comfortable margin from Jamshedpur (East).
'Unlike other political parties, the BJP runs on principals and policies,' he added.

Women police on night raid in Calcutta," An all-woman team of Calcutta police on Friday night arrested 13 men for harassing and behaving inappropriately with women on the roads across south Calcutta.
A team of officers of the anti-rowdy squad of the detective department assisted the women’s team named “The Winners”.
“A woman best understands the plight of another woman. The Winners usually maintain vigil in areas that have women’s colleges and girls’ schools. With the women force on the vigil, such places have become safer for other women,” said an officer of the detective department.
Officers of the all-woman team have been trained in self-defence to counter any adverse situation and capture mischief-makers on roads.
The team raided areas in Netaji Nagar on Friday night and detained 60 people.
“Thirteen out of the 60 detained were arrested for harassing women. The team also seized 51 motorcycles for rogue and reckless driving,” said an officer.
Several women commuters said they felt less vulnerable if women officers were around.
“It is expected that they will be more sensitive towards women’s issues than men. If someone is harassed in an auto, the victim does not have to explain this to the officer how it feels if the officer is a woman herself,” said a college student who lives in Garia and has to commute in public transport every day.
All members of The Winner have been given a scooter each to make them mobile on the roads.
Senior officers said the all-woman team regularly conducted carries out patrol near schools, colleges, shopping malls and arrested men found harassing women and girls.",states
Why traffic stood still on Bogibeel: 'tourists' and picnickers!," An unprecedented rush of picnickers at Bogibeel bridge on New Year’s Day resulted in traffic congestion on both sides of the approach road to the bridge.
Every year, large crowds gather near Bogibeel bridge for picnics but this year along with picnickers, people are coming to see the bridge.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Bogibeel bridge on December 25.
“We sat inside our car for one hour because of the traffic snarl. When we reached Bogibeel we could not find a place because a huge crowd had gathered there for a New Year’s feast,” said Rupjyoti Khound, a resident of Dibrugarh.
The Dibrugarh and Dhemaji district administrations in Upper Assam have issued directives for streamlining traffic on Bogibeel bridge.
On Saturday, the Dibrugarh administration issued a directive requesting police to immediately deploy personnel and adequate force for traffic management on the bridge.
The Dhemaji administration also issued an order on Saturday, prohibiting drivers of vehicles from stopping for more than three minutes on the bridge and warned of action if the rule was not followed. “Traffic management has become a huge challenge after the opening of Bogibeel bridge because vehicles are coming continuously from both the sides. Some of them parked their vehicles in the middle of the bridge to take photos. Our department is working day and night to streamline traffic on the bridge,” said a traffic official.
Bogibeel bridge is the longest rail-cum-road bridge spanning 4.94km which connects Dibrugarh and Dhemaji districts of Upper Assam.
“We have come to see Bogibeel bridge but we had to face a traffic snarl and waited for two hours to get to the bridge. After two hours we finally crossed the bridge to the Dhemaji side,” said Anjali Bhattacharjee, a resident of Tinsukia.
Accidents have occurred on Bogibeel bridge owing to lack of traffic management.
A seven-year-old boy was killed and another was injured on Thursday in two separate accidents on the bridge and its approach road.
John Pame, 7, died after being hit by a vehicle on the approach road at Kulajan in Dhemaji.
In another incident on the same day, Saurav Moran, 7, was critically injured after being hit by a car and admitted to a private nursing home in Dibrugarh.",states
Heritage honour for eateries," Calcuttans have always put a lot of thought to the food on their plates. To honour the foodie in every Calcuttan and map the culinary heritage of the city, Intach in association with The Telegraph presented the Calcutta Culinary Heritage Awards, 2019, to 14 eateries that have made a name in the heart of citizens.
The awardees were given certificates and will be at a later date presented with a blue plaque in line with the blue plaque scheme in London to recognise their heritage status.
A panel of three had shortlisted about a hundred names initially. “There were around a 100 names categorised into different cuisines they served. The criteria for selection was that they had to be within the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area, has been in business since 1960 or earlier, is still in operation or alive in public memory and has a historical or cultural significance,” says Ayan Ghosh, an Intach member.
“We approached the establishments and asked for some document regarding their inception. It could be a corporation certificate or a licence or a lease agreement,” said Ghosh.
They referred to the Calcutta Street Directory brought out by Thacker, Spink & Company to establish the authentic dates and streets where the eateries were located. A lot of unknown facts came to the fore while mapping this intangible heritage of the city. Like Trinca’s and Flury’s operated from the same premises at one time. Or that Kwality restaurant on Park Street first started as a tea room, serving snacks, said PN Ghai, who was there at the Fairlawn Hotel to receive the certificate.
“Kwality was started by my uncle. We used to serve snacks and then we served ice creams made in the kitchen. My family had learnt to make ice creams from Americans in Delhi,” said Ghai.
Bhim Nag, Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy, the custodians of Calcutta’s sweetmeat heritage, do not believe in having branches or expanding geographically. “Its difficult to maintain quality,” said Prajesh Nandy, of Nakur of 1844 vintage.
“This recognition will go a long way in establishing the culinary heritage in the city,” he said.
The Nakur shop on Ramdulal Sarkar Street has retained its vintage look with its red oxide floor where mounds of fresh chena on large wooden plates are rubbed vigorously by the moiras (sweetmakers). Kodapaker monda is the oldest sweetmeat from which other sweets have evolved, said Nandy.
Another restaurateur, who is a stickler for quality is Joel Huang of Eau Chew. “I buy all the ingredients myself and cook too,” said Huang, whose great grandmother started the establishment in 1927.
The list of 14 eateries will not be the only ones to get the blue enamel plaques, which are a heritage product itself. “There will be future editions to the Calcutta Heritage Culinary Awards and more establishments will get added on,” said G.M. Kapur of Intach. ",states

Model booths with festive feel in Jharkhand," Balloons and voting? Why not.
The second phase of Jharkhand’s Great EVM Festival attracted many voters to 129 model booths in East Singhbhum district.
Voters, young and old, loved the balloon-and-flower decorations and Selfie Corners at the model booths.
Md Jawaid, a civil engineer with Dalmia Cement who voted in Rajendra Vidyalaya, Sakchi, under the Jamshedpur West seat, said the model booth “made the voting exercise a joyful festival”.
“It was so well decked up,” said Jawaid. “All around me, I saw positive vibes. Normally, a polling booth is rather boring. The model booth was festive and made one feel proud to participate in the great democratic process. Everyone loved the Selfie Corner.”
But if he had a quibble, it was with the drinking water facility at the model booth.
“I could not have water at the booth because there were no glasses or paper cups near the three water jars,” he said. “But the rest of the arrangements were fine,” he added.
At nearby Rabindra Bhavan, also a model booth, elderly voters appreciated the chairs that they could sit on after they voted. “Model booths are a nice concept, best part is you can click good pictures that are ideal for social media. These arrangements motivate a voter,” said Sreejani Das who voted at Rabindra Bhavan.
But there were a few snags. At the model booth at Vivekananda International School, Mango, voting was late by 90 minutes as the EVM acted up.
Apart from 129 model booths, the district also had 25 booths where all poll officers were women.",states
Lowest turnout in Jamshedpur West," Voting day for Jamshedpur West, one of the best-known seats among the 20 in the second phase of state elections, ended on a grim note, as only 47.42 per cent — less than half the 3.2 lakh voters — had inked their fingers — the lowest on Saturday.
Jamshedpur West, including urban areas Bistupur, Sakchi, Sonari and Mango, hit the headlines this time when veteran BJP MLA and minister Saryu Roy was denied a ticket from the party to make way for newbie Devendra Nath Singh. A humiliated Roy went on to challenge CM Raghubar Das, five-time BJP MLA from Jamshedpur East, leaving West a more or less a straight fight between BJP’s Singh and Congress’s former MLA-minister Banna Gupta.
With Roy out, many in Congressman Gupta’s camp hoped hardcore Roy loyalists would shift allegiance to him. The Singh camp, on its part, hoped that party loyalists would not be swayed by the personality cult. The mystery will be unveiled only on December 23, counting day.
Polling in Jamshedpur West was slow from 7am and 9am when 13.3 per cent votes were cast. By 11am, the polling had risen to 20.3 per cent and by 3pm, to 43.22 per cent. At localities like Zakirnagar, Azadnagar and Jawaharnagar in Mango with over one lakh voters from the minority community, the voting per cent stood at 46 by 3pm, with two more hours of voting left. By 5pm, the figure rose marginally to 47.42 per cent.
At Zakirnagar in Mango, octogenarian Amrul Nisha turned up to cast her vote in a wheelchair. Another octogenarian, Sahnawaz Bano, who could barely walk, came to vote at a polling booth in Azadnagar.
“Many of our young voters are working in the Gulf. If the elderly don’t vote, how can we ensure the victory of the Congress candidate?” quipped a party worker.
At traditional BJP strongholds such as Bhatia Bustee, Uliyan, Shastrinagar, Khuntadih, Gwala Bustee, Adarshnagar in Sonari, people crowded the polling booths.
At posh Bistupur, with some pockets having a distinct tilt toward the saffron party, very few young voters were seen, most studying or working outside Jamshedpur.
“There are nine voters in my family, but only four of us could vote today (Saturday),” said J. Katina, a Bistupur resident, adding the rest were scattered in Bangalore and other cities.
Jamshedpur West has 3.2 lakh voters, including 1.2 lakh from the minority community.",states
Revellers throng Dhanbad butterfly park," The Sir Dorabji Tata Park at Jamadoba here was swarming with butterflies to welcome hundreds of picnickers who flocked to the greens from all across coal town and beyond to celebrate the New Year.
The 10,820sqm park, which generally remains open for visitors between 4pm and 6pm every Sunday, was closed for maintenance for the last two weeks. It was opened from 9am to 5pm on Tuesday as a special case.
The environment department of Tata Steel, which maintains the park, had planted at least 15 different varieties of flowering plants including dahlia, pansy, petunia, marigold, calendula and chrysanthemum in the 1,385sqm butterfly zone to attract more than 20 species of the winged guests.
Some of the butterfly species which were seen hovering in the park included the bright orange Baronet, the brownish Common Baron, the multi-coloured Common Jezebel, the velvet brown Dark Branded Bushbrown, the large-winged Tailed Jay and the long-tailed Paris Peacock.
The butterfly zone, which was created last year near the mango orchard, has 1,687 varieties of plants to attract the flying insects.
Tata Steel and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) had conducted a joint survey of the area in 2015-16 and identified around 20 butterfly species in the area.
Based on the report, Tata Steel had decided to create a special butterfly zone to conserve the biodiversity and also to save the species from becoming endangered.
“After some initial work like ground levelling, intensive plantation began in 2015 during which altogether 1,047 plants, including host plants (used for breeding butterflies) and nectar yielding varieties were planted,” said Ankit Agrahari, senior manager (environment) of Tata Steel Jharia division.

Temple tourist with Kali at heart," Salt Lake recently had a visitor from the US who went — not shopping or sight-seeing but — visiting as many temples as she could.
Deonnie Moodie is a pass-out from Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with a PhD in the Study of Religion. Now an assistant professor of South Asian religions at the University of Oklahama, Deonnie has spent years studying the Kalighat temple and has written the book The Making of a Modern Temple and a Hindu City.
The Telegraph Salt Lake spoke to Deonnie when she had come to visit temples in Salt Lake.
What got you interested in this topic?
Well, I first came to India in 2002 while pursuing an under graduate course on religions of India. I travelled to 11 cities, including Calcutta, where I visited Dakshineshwar and Kalighat.

Eventually I specialised in religions of urban India and religions in modernity, mainly in Calcutta. I lived in Tollygunge for a year and learnt to speak and read Bengali too.
Why Calcutta and why Kali?
When the Europeans wrote the history of Calcutta they began with the arrival of Job Charnock in the 1600s. They made it seem like there was nothing but marshes here before that and it is they who built the city. But later when Bengalis started writing history they said it’s not a city of Charnock but Kali and Kalighat.
Kali is Ma. She gives, she takes away…I’ve seen people keep her picture behind their phones and turn to it in times of trouble. But for me the most interesting was how the Kalighat temple has been central to creating an Indian and Bengali modernity. Kali doesn’t become irrelevant when people become modern. In fact, she stays central to the modernising efforts.
How is that?
When Kalighat became a public temple in the 20th century, the upper-middle class came out and voiced complaints. They complained about misappropriation of funds received as donations, greedy pandas (touts), dishonest sevaits, about the temple being dirty, disorganised…. They talked about it, wrote about it to newspapers and even lodged public interest litigations.
But have the court rulings brought about real change?
The court can pass a ruling but if a chunk of devotees, pandas and sevaits oppose it, what can be done?
CCTVs have been installed to keep an eye on things but as for matters like cleanliness, it boils down to what you classify as dirt. The court may say petals and blood on the floor are dirt but blood is part of what the temple is; Kali receives blood as sacrifice.
Devotees run to smear the spilt blood on their heads as tika or take it home in jars to ward off evil. What is dirt to one is sacred to another.
The beggars who live on the temple grounds are opposed to renovation as they will have nowhere to go. There’s also a school that believes that Kali gave the sevaits the right and responsibility to worship her and so who is anyone else to say they’re doing it wrong?
Is religion important to urban Indians today?
Well, many may not go to Kalighat anymore citing the dirt and harassment but they still ask their domestic helps to go make a sacrifice on their behalf.
People create the temples they need. My landlord, for instance, had a thakur ghor inside his cupboard!
This is what I want to focus on next — home shrines. Community is a big part of religion so people still go to temples but home shrines are increasingly getting important.
I’ve studied Bengalis in the US too and while they celebrate Durga, Kali or Saraswati puja, temples are not that important to them. Most temples in the US have pictures of many gods but the temples themselves are built by south Indians, with typical southern architecture.
What brought you to Salt Lake?
Well, I want to study how religion is practised in suburbs like this one. I mean Salt Lake is a planned township with space earmarked right from the start for parks, markets and hospitals but why not for temples?
I agree Salt Lake was planned by a Yugoslav architect-planner (Dobrivoje Toskovic) but he did it in consultation with BC Roy and other Indians so why this glaring omission?
But like I said, people create the temples they need…under trees, outside their complexes…. (On this trip Deonnie visited a Shani temple under a tree outside GD Market, the EC Block Kali temple, the CRPF Camp Shiva temple and Loknath temple outside the stadium).
How religious are people in the US?
Well, just like in India, some Americans are religious, some are not. On Sunday mornings gyms and libraries are more likely to be crowded than churches. But people think of god as a source of strength.
My students are interested in religion. Most have never met a Hindu, Muslim, Jain or Sikh before. They may have stereotypes in their minds and are not comfortable discussing them with their families. They come to my class to gain exposure.
And which god do you pray to?
I am culturally a Christian, married to a Jew. My job is not to give verdict on which religion is right and wrong. I don’t judge, I just want to know what you believe.
My husband and I are raising our son to be curious about religion. We’re telling him we don’t know what happens after death and so we have to focus on our actions now as what we do affects one other. ",states
Jorhat auction goes live on Tea Day," Jorhat tea auction centre will go live on International Tea Day (May 21) with more emphasis on quality.
Jorhat is Assam’s second tea auction centre after Guwahati.
The Jorhat e-Auction Platform will be run by mjunction in association with Tea Board India. The company, mjunction services limited, is a 50:50 venture promoted by SAIL and Tata Steel.
The auction will be held on May 21 from 11am. Sellers shall upload and submit Garden Invoices (GI) on the Jorhat platform latest by Tuesday at 11am. Sellers shall login to MJ (mjunction) platform with their usernames and passwords and upload the tea details to be put up for auction.
The minimum lot size per invoice, to be packed by sellers, shall be 5 packages.
The auction will be conducted once every week- every Monday.
Depending on volume and process improvement, it may be scheduled twice a week later.“With the auction platform, a new service has been planned in unprecedented times, in the middle of a pandemic with little change from the original model which shows the aspirations of the industry to meet uncertainties,” the official said, adding that many of the unique services have been given a final shape by mjunction by drawing upon its experience across a wide array of commodities.
The official said one of the novelties of the Jorhat e-Auction Platform would be quality vocabulary through which teas will be judged.
“A detailed quality vocabulary shall be provided to help buyers objectively arrive on quality. Specific comments shall be given on leaf appearance, infusion and liquor. There shall be further sub-parameters under each of the broad heads. A rating system from 1 to 10 shall be followed with 1 being low in quality and 10 being excellent,” the official said. At present, teas are valued based on physical appearance, which is done by brokers. “Sample distribution will start after normalcy but quality vocabulary would be available both then and now,” the official added.
“This will be a historic event for various reasons. The longstanding demand of the stakeholders for a separate auction platform in Assam is over. This step will help accommodate the larger volume of Assam tea which contributes more than 50 per cent of the country’s production.”
A weekly auction cycle shall be followed instead of the four weeks earlier. On the mjunction platform, all important activities like catalogue closing, auction day and buyers’ prompt day shall be carried out on a Monday.
“We are overwhelmed with the response of tea industry to the Jorhat e-marketplace. We are confident that with the support of the tea community, the tea e-marketplace would usher in increased reach, efficiency, and shorter cycle time for the good of the entire tea community,” said Vinaya Varma, managing director of mjunction.
The Guwahati Tea Auction Buyers Association says it will give a new experience to its members.",states
Trinamul MLA Sabyasachi Dutta joins BJP," Trinamul MLA and former Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta, who had often criticised Mamata Banerjee, joined the BJP on Tuesday in the presence of party chief Amit Shah.

Rajeev Kumar gets bail from Calcutta High Court," Former Calcutta police chief Rajeev Kumar, allegedly absconding after apprehending arrest by the CBI in the Saradha probe, got a breather on Tuesday after a Calcutta High Court division bench granted him anticipatory bail.
Soon after, CBI sources said they had started the process for challenging the verdict in the Supreme Court.
Accepting the bail plea of the IPS officer, the division bench of Justices Sahidullah Munshi and Subhasish Dasgupta held that at this stage of the Saradha probe, there is no need for the CBI to seek Kumar’s custodial interrogation.
The bench also said Kumar had co-operated with the CBI and appeared before the agency whenever called. The court, however, asked Kumar to obtain a formal bail from any subordinate court by furnishing two personal release bonds of Rs 50,000 each.
The court directed Kumar to appear before the CBI investigators and co-operate with them. “The CBI will have to issue a 48-hour prior notice to the petitioner (Kumar) asking him to appear before it,” the bench said.
To secure bail, Kumar had moved every level of the judiciary since April this year, after the Supreme Court withdrew his protection and gave him the liberty to seek anticipatory bail before any court in Bengal.
As the CBI had issued a notice to Kumar in May this year to appear, the IPS officer first moved Calcutta High Court seeking quashing of the notice. The court then issued an interim order restraining the CBI from taking any coercive measures against Kumar till his petition was disposed of.
On September 3, a single-judge bench of Justice Madhu Mitra dismissed Kumar plea, holding that the CBI had the power to interrogate Kumar.
Armed with the order, the CBI officers went to Kumar’s residence at Park Street that very day to hand him a notice asking him to appear for interrogation the next day. But Kumar was not available at his residence. Since then, the investigators have raided various places in the state but failed to trace him.
Kumar had first moved an anticipatory before a Barasat judge. He failed to obtain an order and then moved the district and sessions judge of Alipore. But the Alipore judge, too, declined to grant him bail. Kumar then moved the division bench of the high court.
According to CBI, as a member of the special investigation team formed by the Mamata Banerjee government to probe the Saradha scam, Kumar had damaged certain documents which he did not hand over to the agency after the Supreme Court entrusted it with the probe. ",states
Assam govt mulls solution for lockdown 4 immobility," A fresh problem has arisen before the state government — to address the troubles of the section of people who are unable to run their business during lockdown 4.0.
Business in the city edged towards normalcy on the first day of the fourth phase of the lockdown with relaxations allowing shops to open, barring shopping malls, salons, gymnasiums and parlours.
The government has not allowed these places to function yet.
On Monday, the Guwahati development department asked the Kamrup (metro) district administration to prepare a road map urgently to deal with the situation while continuing to fight Covid-19, the move coming 54 days after the lockdown began on March 24 midnight.
GDD minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya, after a discussion with the district authority, said, “A new problem has arisen. A large number of people who work in shopping malls, gymnasiums or run salons and beauty parlours continue to suffer because of the lockdown. Therefore, I have asked the district authority and the labour department to come up with a roadmap for the next three months to provide relief to these people. They are in deep trouble.”
He said immediate and innovative steps were required to address the situation.
Earlier, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, citing a survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), had said that Assam was losing around Rs 1,000 crore daily because of the Covid-19-induced lockdown.
To those who have opened shops, city police issued a warning — adhere to the norms of social distancing and face cover or lose trade licence.
The authortities fear a possible rush in the market in view of Id celebrations and lockdown 4.0 relaxations.
Guwahati police commissioner M.P. Gupta said, “Since the lockdown has been eased for public utility, we urge the public to strictly adhere to the norm of social distancing. We have also decided to impose a fine of Rs 500 for not wearing face masks.”
On Monday, the top brass of the state police visited the containment zone of Fancy Bazar, the business hub of the Northeast which continues to remain closed, to assess the situation.
The traders in the area believe that it will be safe to reopen business only after the swab test results of the workers in the area are out.
A shopkeeper said, “Some of the traders wanted to open their shops today following lockdown 4.0 relaxations but we decided not to till the reports come clean.”
The health department has tested hundreds of workers from the area after about 20 people, contacts of the market’s first patient, were found to be positive.
The state Covid count was 106 till the filing of this report with at least 31 cases from the city.
Many traders also requested the Kamrup (metro) district administration to take immediate steps in terms of perishable food stocks lying unattended due to the containment zone restrictions in the area.
The metro administration declared Haryana Bhawan near Bharalumukh as a containment zone on Monday, following the detection of one positive case from a quarantine centre there. The city now has a dozen containment zones. The administration also withdrew its order of closure of Allahabad Bank, Machkhowa branch, here after the bank officials tested negative on Monday.
The bank authorities were asked to properly sanitise the bank premises before resuming their activities.",states

Fish bite into Bhai Phonta pockets,"  Hilsa sold at Rs 1,500 a kilo at Gariahat, Maniktala and other markets in the city on Thursday. Topshe cost Rs 750 and parshe Rs 500 plus.
A day before Bhai Phonta, the price of Bengal’s favourite fishes soared across the markets but still found takers.
Most varieties of fish in the market have become costlier by at least Rs 100 a kilo since last week. Hilsa, on its way out for this year, has seen a steeper rise, fish sellers said.
Tarun Parui, a businessman from Howrah, bought a 1.25kg hilsa from Maniktala on Thursday evening. “I was in two minds over hilsa and mutton. But when the fish seller said the hilsa was from Bangladesh, it was a no-brainer,” said Parui, who will host his brother-in-law for lunch on Friday.
“I get treated to a lavish feast on Jamai Sashthi at my in-laws’ place every year. Bhai Phonta is when I get to play host and I don’t want a loss of face,” said Parui, a regular at Maniktala. He also bought lobsters for Rs 600 a kilo.
Bacchu Pramanik, a fish seller at Maniktala, said apart from hilsa and prawn, topshe, parshe and pomfret were the hot selling items.
Pratima Roy bought topshe and parshe from Gariahat, for Rs 750 and Rs 500 a kilo respectively. Also on her shopping list was mutton. “I like to cook for my brothers on Bhai Phonta,” said Roy, 49, a Bengali teacher at a government school.
A group of three sisters came looking for katla, lobsters, pabda and topshe at the Gariahat market on Thursday morning. “We have a grand family feast on Bhai Phonta every year. We have two cousins who come with their families,” said Tulika Bandopadhyaya, 40, the elder sister.",states

“We have given different specialists separate dates for convenience of patients during the one-hour period. While general medicine specialists will be available on Monday, orthopaedic and child specialists will be available on Tuesday, surgery specialists will be available on Wednesday, eye and gynaecology specialists on Thursday, ENT (ear, nose and throat) and dentists on Friday and skin specialists on Saturday,” said Pathak.
In view of the large number of migrant workers returning to the state, most of them without work and under mental trauma, the health department also has psychiatrist consultation daily for an hour.
“We have three psychiatrists from the state health department and one from RIMS who will be offering their services on the telemedicine portal depending on the roster throughout the week for one hour between 1pm and 2pm. It is needed because during the lockdown there have been cases of people suffering from depression and with a large number of migrant workers returning after leaving their jobs and earning under mental trauma, such counselling will help them turn a new leaf,” said Pathak.
This would be in addition to the counselling provided by general physicians and a women doctors daily (except Sundays) between 11am and 1pm and between 3pm and 5pm.
Jharkhand became the 12th state to be integrated into the telemedicine facility of the NHM on May 1. People can login to the portal through laptops or smartphones from their home and get medical consultation for free without having to wait in line at hospital outpatient departments.
A patient will have to log in from anywhere by registering on the portal filling up some mandatory fields like phone number (for generation of OTP), name, address and will get a token number. The patient will have to again login entering the phone number and the token number and enter into the waiting room with names of doctors available for consultation and wait for turn (based on token number) to consult the doctor. After the consultation, one will have to download the e-prescription for purchasing medicines. ",states
Cyclone Amphan to bring relief from swelter," Several districts of Jharkhand are experiencing muggy weather owing to high humidity caused by moisture incursion into the atmosphere, but some relief is on the way.
The sweltering heat has upped the discomfort index and weathermen have warned of another 24 hours of torment before the state can hope for some rain in the wake of cyclone Amphan.
“The weather will continue to be humid for the next 24 hours due to the westerly wind coupled with moisture incursion into the atmosphere,” S.D. Kotal, director of the India Meteorological Department's Ranchi centre, said on Monday.
The average discomfort index, measured on the basis of temperature, humidity and wind pattern, was as high as 64°, nine notches above normal, in the state on Monday.
The index in Jamshedpur touched a tormenting 65°, 10 notches above normal, while in capital Ranchi it was 62°, seven points above normal.

In places such as Daltonganj, Bokaro and Dhanbad, the discomfort index was between 65° and 66°, much higher than the normal.
The day’s temperature on Sunday had touched an oppressive 40°C in several parts of the state, specially in the southern and north-western parts.
Chaibasa in West Singhbhum and several places in Palamau region recorded around 40°C for the second consecutive day on Monday.
Kotal said cyclone Amphan, which originated from the Bay of Bengal, would start impacting Jharkhand’s weather from Tuesday afternoon.
“Cloud formation will take place especially in those districts of Jharkhand, which are close to Bengal and Odisha. Gusty winds, rain and thunder are expected on Wednesday and Thursday,” he said.
The Met office director, however, said no warning of heavy rain had been issued for Jharkhand.
Monday’s satellite pictures suggested that cyclone Amphan was located around 780km south of Paradip (Odisha), 930km south-southwest of Digha (Bengal) and 1,050km south-southwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh). It is likely to intensify further into a super cyclone during the next 24 hours.
The cyclone is very likely to move northwards for some time and then to northwest Bay of Bengal and cross Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between Digha (Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) on Wednesday afternoon.",states
Attacks on cops a sign of worry in Ranchi and places nearby," Incidents of mobs targeting police are on the rise in the state capital and places nearby.
On Sunday afternoon three police personnel, including officer-in-charge of Kanke police station, Vinay Kumar Singh, and two constables accompanying him, Parvinder Kumar, and Upendra Sah, suffered injuries after villagers attacked them at Nagri, about 18km from the district headquarters under the jurisdiction of Kanke police station.
They had gone to rescue three persons accused of opening fire on paan shop owner Samshad Ansari alias Guddu.
“Around 200 villagers laid siege on the office where the accused were hiding. As Vinay Kumar Singh heard about it he rushed to rescue around 3.15pm. As villagers realised that the police had come to rescue the accused, they got infuriated and attacked the police team and damaged their vehicles with sticks and stones,” a locality resident said.
Singh confirmed the incident saying he had minor injuries on his left hand, shoulder and knee, and his constables suffered head injuries.

“I am alright but my constables have head injuries and doctors suggested CT scan. Villagers would have lynched the accused in case we had not reached on time,” Singh said.
Asked the reason behind opening fire on Guddu, Singh said: “It was a dispute over collection of Rs 5,000 which Guddu had given to the accused Saddam, Raja and David Sanga. We are investigating it.”
Police were also attacked on May 15 at Parhepat, a village about 18km from the city under Ratu police station area. An FIR o the incident was registered on May 16.

"Harold Evans, editor with a backbone, dies"," Harold Evans, one of the most influential media figures of his generation and voted “the greatest newspaper editor of all time” by journalists in Britain, has died of heart failure in New York at the age of 92.
Some of Britain’s best known journalists who worked for Evans when he championed investigative journalism as editor of The Sunday Times, London, from 1967 to 1981 paid tribute to the crusading editor who believed facts were sacred and that unbiased and independent reporting was essential in a functioning democracy.
One of them was Ian Jack, the former editor of Granta, who told The Telegraph: “Harry had an almost Victorian belief in the capacity of journalism to improve and enlighten its audience, and went to great lengths to make complex subjects intelligible to the lay reader. Clarity was an obsession. As an editor, he was inspirational, sympathetic and generous. I and many others were lucky to have worked with him and for him. He gave me opportunities — reporting in India was one of them — that changed the direction of my life.”
Assessing what made Evans “an editor’s editor”, Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of The Guardian, said: “He could do it all. Write like a dream; design with impact; edit with flair; dash off the perfect headline; crop a picture…. There was no one who knew more about the craft of journalism, nor anyone to match his passion for communicating that craft — documented in numerous textbooks that were, in turn, studied by generations of would-be journalists.
“What was the one immutable rule of journalism, I asked him in 2010? ‘Things are not what they seem on the surface. Dig deeper, dig deeper, dig deeper’.”

Rusbridger added: “Harry knew there was no point in publishing stories if you didn’t defend them. Though often thin-skinned, he possessed that useful piece of editorial equipment: a backbone.”
The campaign for which Evans is best remembered is exposing the “Thalidomide scandal”, launched in 1972, involving Distillers, a company whose drug prescribed to pregnant women to control morning sickness caused thousands of babies in Britain and across the world to be born with missing limbs, deformed hearts, blindness and other problems.
Along the way were months investigating the life and treachery of the British spy Kim Philby, and exhaustive reporting of what actually happened in Derry on Bloody Sunday in 1972 when 14 demonstrators were shot dead by the British army.
Evans forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in Darlington in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950.
Stephen Grey of Reuters, where Evans was editor-at-large, wrote in a tribute: “Evans liked to quote his famous 19th Century predecessor at the Northern Echo regional paper, William Stead, who on appointment declared: ‘What a glorious opportunity of attacking the devil, isn’t it?’”
His fortunes changed when Rupert Murdoch bought The Sunday Times and The Times after a strike by print workers had closed the papers for a year. Evans was moved to the editorship of The Times but quit after a few months.
About his relationship with Murdoch, Evans said: “My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what The Times became.”
He wrote about his experience in his book, Good Times, Bad Times and concluded: “Ultimately, all stands or falls on the values and judgement of the proprietor. At its highest levels, a great newspaper is not simply a personal possession but a public trust.”
In 1984, he and his second wife, Tina Brown, made a new life for themselves in America. While she edited Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, he became the founding editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine and later president of the publishing giant, Random House.
The couple became leading socialites on the New York scene — their legendary parties were attended by the great and the good.
Pulitzer-winning journalist Robert D. McFadden wrote in The New York Times: “At a party or a breakfast, Mr. Evans conveyed a world-weary charm, talking in cultured tones of books and newspaper adventures. Wiry at 5-foot-7, he could appear slightly rumpled from all the travel. Under flyaway hair, his expression was typically thoughtful, a face out of Fellini: gaunt, intense, lined with a lifetime of editorial decisions.”
McFadden recalled that Evans feared for the future of newspapers and what impact their decline might have on the democratic institutions.
Evans had said in 2009: “The kind of investigative journalism, which I think is the absolute essence, is in danger and, in fact, in many places has vanished. We have to have this searchlight to know what the hell is going on. So when newspapers or TV neglect reporting, so you get chunks of opinion without any factual basis whatsoever, we’re all going to suffer for it.”",world
"2,500 students at Swiss school quarantined"," Swiss health authorities have ordered a quarantine for 2,500 students at a prestigious hospitality management school in the city of Lausanne after “significant outbreaks” of Covid-19 that are a suspected byproduct of off-campus partying.
Authorities in Switzerland’s Vaud canton, or region, said all undergraduates at the Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne, known as the Lausanne Hospitality Management University in English, had been ordered to quarantine both on and off-campus because the number of outbreaks “made a more targeted closure impossible”.
“The earliest elements of an investigation indicate that the organisation of one or more parties was at the origin of these many outbreaks of infection,” the Vaud regional office said in a statement, adding that the parties seemed to take place before new containment measures in the region were announced on September 15.
School administrators were taking “all necessary measures” to ensure that classes were continuing online, the statement said.
University spokesman Sherif Mamdouh said on Thursday that 11 students had tested positive for the coronavirus and none required hospitalisation.

Peaceful transition? We’ll see: Trump on election," US President Donald Trump declined on Wednesday to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the November 3 election to Democratic rival Joe Biden and said he expected the election battle to end up before the Supreme Court.
“We’re going to have to see what happens,” Trump, a Republican, told reporters when asked whether he would commit to transferring power.
The President, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, has repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, asserting without evidence that mail-in voting would lead to fraud and a “rigged” outcome. “The ballots are a disaster,” Trump said.
Democrats have encouraged voting by mail as a way to cast ballots safely during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of Americans, including much of the military, have cast absentee ballots by mail for years without problems.
In 2016, Trump also raised questions about whether he would accept the results of the election. He went on to win the presidency.
Biden told reporters in Delaware that Trump’s comments on the transition of power were “irrational.” His campaign said it was prepared for any“ shenanigans” from Trump, and reiterated comments from July that “the US government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.” Trump, who is moving quickly to nominate a successor to liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday, said earlier on Wednesday he thinks the election “will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it’s very important that we have nine Justices”. Trump plans to announce his nominee on Saturday.
A Senate confirmation vote before the election would seal a 6-3 conservative majority on the court, potentially spelling trouble for Democrats should it be called on to decide any legal dispute over the results of the election.
“This scam that the Democrats are pulling, it’s a scam, the scam will be before the US Supreme Court, and I think having a 4-4 situation is not a good situation,” Trump said.
Only one US presidential election, the 2000 contest between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, has had its outcome determined by the Supreme Court.
Earlier, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Biden said Republicans were “violating the essence” of what the country’s founders had intended in quickly seeking to fill the Supreme Court seat. ",world
Facebook oversight board debut plan before US polls," Facebook Inc’s long-delayed independent oversight board plans to launch in mid-late October, just before the November US presidential election, although a board member said he did not know whether it would hear cases related to the contest.
The board, created by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, will initially have the power to review decisions to take down posts from Facebook and Instagram, and recommend policy changes.
Oversight board member Alan Rusbridger told Reuters in an interview that the board was now aiming for an October launch. A spokesman confirmed that timetable, saying the launch, originally planned for last year, had also been slowed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Rusbridger said he did not know whether the board would hear cases about content connected to the US presidential election, but he said cases involving President Donald Trump’s posts were not among those that the board had looked at for trial runs.
“We haven’t done a Trump case,” said Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of Britain’s Guardian newspaper. “We have done a nudity case, we’ve done a blasphemy case.”
The board will initially review only appeals over posts that Facebook has taken down, rather than content the company decides to leave up. Some experts say that means it will be of little use in addressing problems such as misinformation and hate speech.
It will also at first only deal with individual posts, not Facebook ads, or groups.
Rusbridger declined to comment on Facebook’s policy of exempting politicians’ speech and ads from its third-party fact-checking programme, though he said: “I can’t imagine we won’t have a case brought to us on that.” ",world
US cops shot at during protests after Breonna Taylor case verdict," Two police officers were shot and wounded late on Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky, during protests of a grand jury ruling decried by civil rights activists as a miscarriage of justice in the fatal police shooting of a Black woman in March.
The grand jury decided that none of the three white officers involved in the deadly police raid on Breonna Taylor’s apartment would be charged for causing her death, though one officer was indicted on charges of endangering her neighbours.
The indictment came more than six months after Taylor, 26, a Black emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse, was killed in front of her armed boyfriend after the three officers forced their way into her home with a search warrant in a drug trafficking investigation.
Her death became a symbol, and her image a familiar sight, during months of daily protests against racial injustice and police brutality in cities across the US.
Following the grand jury announcement, protesters immediately took to the streets of Kentucky’s largest city and marched for hours chanting, “No lives matter until Black lives matter,” amid sporadic clashes with police in riot gear.
The demonstrations remained mostly peaceful until several gunshots rang out as heavily armed police closed in on a throng of protesters at nightfall, ordering the crowd to disperse about a half hour before a 9pm curfew was due to go into effect.
A Reuters journalist on the scene heard gunfire erupt from the crowd moments after police had fired chemical irritants and “flash-bang” rounds.
Two officers were shot and wounded, interim Louisville Metropolitan Police chief Robert Schroeder told reporters.
One suspect was arrested, and the two wounded officers were in stable condition — one undergoing surgery — with non-life-threatening injuries, Schroeder said.
Earlier in the day, about a dozen people were arrested in a skirmish between hundreds of demonstrators and a group of law enforcement officers in the Highlands neighbourhood just outside downtown Louisville. Some windows of nearby businesses were also broken. The crowds largely dissipated after Wednesday night’s shooting. The police said at least 46 arrests were made in all.
Sympathy protests were held in several cities on Wednesday, including New York, Washington and Chicago. In announcing the grand jury’s conclusions, Kentucky attorney-general Daniel Cameron said the panel had declined to bring any charges against two of the three white policemen who fired into Taylor’s apartment on March 13.
The two officers, Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, were found to have been justified under Kentucky law in returning fire after Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, shot at them, wounding Mattingly in the thigh, Cameron said.
Walker has contended he believed intruders were breaking into Taylor’s home and that the couple did not hear police announce their arrival.
The third officer, former Detective Brett Hankison, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree, an offense that ranks at the lowest level of felony crimes in Kentucky and carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
Cameron, however, said there was “no conclusive” evidence that any of Hankison’s bullets struck Taylor.
“There is no doubt that this is a gut-wrenching, emotional case,” he said at a news conference.",world
New normal: Classes in pool cabanas," This summer, Michelle Carucci’s family cancelled its annual Jersey Shore vacation because of the pandemic. So when Carucci, who lives in White Township, learned that The Great Wolf Lodge, a family-favourite indoor water park in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, was setting up a “schoolhouse” and socially distanced activities this fall, she jumped at the chance to take her youngest child.
Gianna Carucci, 11, has all her classes online, and during the mornings of her and her mother’s two-day stay (in the middle of the week, when rates were lower and crowds were smaller), she headed to “Wiley’s Schoolhouse”: a large conference room repurposed to be a socially distanced learning space for children aged 5 and up.
Named after the brand’s wolf mascot, each space is equipped with desks that are placed eight to 10 feet apart and fitted with plexiglass partitions. Open Monday through Thursday, the room is staffed to help children connect with their schools, provide snacks and lead break-time activities. Reservations are required for the programme, which costs $85 per day. All participants must wear masks.
It would be “nice to have a few hours to myself while Gianna is in school,” Carucci, 45, a health and fitness coach, said in an interview before their trip. After classes wrapped up, she and her daughter played at the lodge’s water park together.
The coronavirus has left hotels and resorts scrambling for guests as occupancy rates plummeted in the spring. Some properties have tried to drum up business by touting new cleaning regimens, rethinking amenities and offering free nights. Others closed entirely, waiting or unable to wait for the public health situation to improve. Now, with the pandemic ongoing and millions of school-age children juggling remote learning, some hotels are beckoning families with offers of “schoolcation,” including new staffed learning spaces, technology and tutors — even partnerships with museums and other educational experts.
Learning officer
Usually, families with schoolchildren are tied to their school’s calendar, with vacations often limited to during the holidays.
But now, for those with the flexibility and desire to travel, “there’s an opportunity for a change in scenery,” said Kathleen Reidenbach, chief commercial officer with Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, a line of boutique hotels owned by IHG.
Kimpton recently introduced a “chief virtual learning officer” to nine of its properties this fall, an on-site employee who will take on this role to help with Wi-Fi, virtual meeting software or other technical needs. Some locations will provide free school supplies, kid-sized desks snack packs, document printing and flexible checkout times to guests with school-age children.
Reidenbach said while many families can now travel in September and October, they may need help managing remote work and school. “We wanted to adjust our programming,” she said, to make that possible. 
Nancy and Jim Liddell from Connecticut decided to venture into New York City for a few days this month with their three children. The family hoped to go to the newly reopened Metropolitan Museum of Art and to see the new Suffragist statues in Central Park.
The Liddell daughters, aged 9 to 13, attend public school and now have a school week that alternates between in-person and online instruction depending on the day. “We planned to go when class was online,” Liddell said. Staying at the Kimpton Muse Hotel in New York City, the girls were given festive school supplies and had the desk space and Wi-Fi they needed to attend class. “The hotel made sure we didn’t have to worry about the girls not being able to complete their school work,” said Liddell, who works in financial services.  While five Great Wolf Lodge properties are repurposing conference rooms into “Wiley’s Schoolhouses,” the brand is not alone in carving new “virtual classrooms” out of existing space. The W South Beach hotel in Miami, after closing completely in March, plans to reopen in November with poolside cabanas that can be set up with desks, including small ones for grade schoolers, as well as Wi-Fi and a sound system. Prices range from $500 to $700 a day (private academic tutors are also available, as are personal trainers to provide physical-education classes. Pricing is ala carte.) In Florida, the Four Seasons Orlando Resort is outfitting dedicated staffed learning spaces for a maximum of six children per room, with an outdoor terrace for breaks and craft time. Half-day sessions cost $50 per child.
Some hotels that don’t have the space are partnering with a local museum: Schoolchildren staying at the Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach can complete their schoolwork at the nearby Clearwater Marine Aquarium Education Center and then participate in tours and activities with a marine biologist there. Stays include two spa treatments for the parents and start around $479 per night.

"US elections 2020: Trump bar on Cuban rum, cigars"," US President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed new curbs on imports of Cuban rum and cigars and banned Americans from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government, as he seeks to lock in the Cuban-American vote in the swing state of Florida ahead of November’s presidential election.
“Today, as part of our continuing fight against communist oppression, I am announcing that the treasury department will prohibit US travellers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government,” Trump said at a White House event.
“We’re also further restricting the importation of alcohol and Cuban tobacco,” the Republican President said at the ceremony honouring Bay of Pigs veterans and commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1980 Mariel boatlift that brought 120,000 Cubans to Miami.
Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has sought to unwind a detente with Cuba pursued by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama.
In June 2019, the Trump administration imposed heavy new restrictions on travel to Cuba, saying the move aimed to further pressure the communist government over its support for Venezuela’s embattled President Nicolas Maduro.
The treasury department had said at that time that the US would no longer allow so-called group people-to-people educational travel, one of the most popular exemptions to the overall ban on US tourism to Cuba. 
Earlier this year, the Trump administration ordered Marriott International to wind down hotel operations in Cuba. Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, was the first US hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid the normalisation of relations sought by Obama.
The US sanctions have further crippled an economy already struggling with a decline in aid from Leftist ally Venezuela.
The move also comes as Trump and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden remained locked in a tight race in Florida, a state that Trump won in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points. Trump’s aides believe his toughened stance on Cuba, as well as Venezuela, has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in the state.
No Republican has won the presidency without Florida since Calvin Coolidge in 
1924, and Trump will hold a rally in Jacksonville on Thursday.",world
Eiffel Tower evacuated for several hours after bomb scare," The Eiffel Tower was evacuated for several hours on Wednesday after police received a call suggesting a bomb had been placed there.
The Paris monument had been searched and no explosives found, a police spokesperson said. The tower reopened around 2.25pm. 
Several hundred people, including tourists, restaurant staff and workmen were led away from the tower in the late morning. “It was an orderly evacuation, there was no panic,” said Manuel, a tour guide on site. ",world
James Bond namesake found in Polish Cold War archives," Poles were left shaken and stirred by news that a suspected British agent called James Bond was on Her Majesty’s secret service in the country in the 1960s, after the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) posted about him on social media.
According to the institute’s archive, James Bond came to Poland on February 18, 1964, and was officially employed as an archivist for the British Embassy Military Attache. He soon came to the attention of Polish counter-intelligence officers.
“We know he was in Poland... in 1964 and 1965,” Marzena Kruk, director of the IPN’s archive, told Reuters.
“He travelled a bit around Poland... he liked women, the same as his literary namesake, but there is not even a word about Martini,” she said, referring to the fictional character’s favourite tipple. “However, there is information that he liked Polish beer.”
Bond was under strict surveillance, and visited the Bialystok and Olsztyn regions of northeastern Poland to try and “penetrate military facilities” in the Soviet satellite state, according to the files.
However, he was found not to have made contacts with Polish citizens, which would have had serious consequences for any Poles suspected of working with agents from the other side of the Iron Curtain.
The British agent 007 created by author Ian Fleming hit the silver screen in 1962 when actor Sean Connery played the character in the film Dr. No, leading some to suspect British spies may have been playing a joke on their Polish counterparts with their choice of pseudonym.
“Maybe it was a bit of fun with Polish counter-intelligence, maybe he had a sense of humour,” Kruk said.",world
Robots to kill virus at London station," Robots that can kill the coronavirus with ultraviolet light have been brought in at one of London’s biggest train stations, St Pancras International, as it tries to restore customer confidence in the safety of travel hubs.
Stations suffered a blow on Tuesday when Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to work from home again where possible and also ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a second wave of Covid-19 infections.
St Pancras International saw 34.6 million entries and exits in the year to March 2019, the most recently available yearly data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), making it the ninth-busiest station in the country. The ORR has said the pandemic caused a dramatic fall in rail use.
“The main thing for us is to get the confidence of customers,” said Jay Newton, head of stations engineering and operations for the high speed, one-channel tunnel rail link.
“We are the first train station to bring this type of technology in because we want to allow people to use a train station with confidence, use our retail units with confidence, and slowly get back to a normal way,” he told Reuters.
The robots use ultraviolet light to sweep large areas without the need for chemical disinfectant, the station said, adding the technology could kill nearly 100 per cent of bacteria and viruses — including the coronavirus — on surfaces and in the surrounding air in minutes.
St Pancras International is the terminus of the Eurostar link to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and also shares links to six London Underground lines with neighbouring King’s Cross station. Prime Minister Johnson on Wednesday promised to help companies try to save jobs put at risk by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“These are indeed tough times, and I have no doubt that many businesses, many employees are feeling a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty, and we will do our level best to protect them throughout this period,” Johnson said in Parliament. 
He said Britain had a massive package of measure to protect jobs, and would be looking at creative ways to do more. “We’re looking at a massive package of investment now in jobs and growth... in the short, medium and long term,” he told Parliament.
He said “of course” the government was also going to come forward with more measures, but ruled out a simple extension of the existing furlough scheme. ",world

"Vodafone wins Rs 22,100 cr retro tax case against India"," British telecom giant Vodafone Group plc on Friday won an arbitration against the Indian government over a demand for Rs 22,100 crore in taxes using retrospective legislation.
An international arbitration tribunal ruled that India's demand in past taxes were in breach of fair treatment under a bilateral investment protection pact.
""The award is confidential but Vodafone can confirm that the tribunal has found (it) in Vodafone's favour,"" Vodafone Group said in a statement. ""We are studying the lengthy documents and can make no further comment at this time.""
It was not immediately known if the Indian government will abide by the arbitration award.
The Government of India's liability will be restricted to about Rs 75 crore -- Rs 30 crore in cost and another Rs 45 crore in tax refund, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Vodafone had before the arbitration tribunal challenged India's usage of a 2012 legislation that gave it powers to retrospectively tax deals like Vodafone's USD 11 billion acquisition of 67 per cent stake in the mobile phone business owned by Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.
It challenged the demand of Rs 7,990 crore in capital gains taxes (Rs 22,100 crore after including interest and penalty) under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).
Sources said the tax demand was on the UK-listed company and Vodafone's India venture faced no liability.
Vodafone merged its India operations with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla's conglomerate but the combined entity Vodafone Idea Ltd is facing a USD 7.8 billion bill in past statutory dues.
Tax authorities had in September 2007 served notice to Vodafone International Holdings BV (VIHBV) for its alleged failure to deduct withholding tax from consideration paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd.
Vodafone challenged this in the Supreme Court, which in January 2012 set it aside, saying the transaction was not taxable in India and so the company had no obligation to withhold tax.
In May that year, Parliament passed the Finance Act 2012 that amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 with retrospective effect to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets.
The company was in January 2013 served a tax notice of Rs 14,200 crore after including interest on the principal amount. A year later, Vodafone challenged the tax demand under the Dutch BIT.
Sources said the company in April 2014 served the notice of arbitration after out-of-court dispute resolution talks failed.
The tax department in February 2016 served a demand notice of Rs 22,100 crore, including interest accruing since the date of the original demand.
Vodafone has always maintained that there is no liability and that it will ""continue to defend vigorously any allegation that VIHBV or Vodafone India Ltd is liable to pay tax in connection with the transaction with Hutchison and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress"".
Besides Vodafone, the Indian government also used the retrospective tax legislation to seek Rs 10,247 crore from British oil explorer Cairn Energy Plc over a 2006 reorganisation of its Indian businesses.",business
ED notice to attach Rs 127 cr London flat of Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor," The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a Rs 127-crore flat of Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor in London in connection with a money laundering investigation against him and others, the central agency said on Friday.
The agency issued a provisional order for attaching the property -- Apartment 1, 77 South Audley Street, London -- under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
""The market value of the flat is 13.5 million pound (about Rs 127 crore). The property was purchased by Rana Kapoor in 2017 for 9.9 million pound (Rs 93 crore) in the name of DOIT Creations Jersey Limited and he is the beneficial owner,"" the ED said in a statement.
It claimed that the agency had obtained ""information from a reliable source that Kapoor was trying to alienate this property in London and that he has hired a reputed property consultant.""
""Enquiries from open sources confirmed that this property has been listed for sale on several websites,"" it said.
The agency, as per procedure, will now approach their counterparts in the United Kingdom to execute the attachment order and will issue a proclamation that the asset cannot be sold or purchased as it has been seized under the criminal sections of the PMLA.
The ED has earlier attached assets in the US, Dubai and Australia in a similar fashion as part of other investigations under the PMLA.
The ED had booked Kapoor, his family members and others under the PMLA after studying a CBI FIR that alleged that dubious multi-crore loans were given by Yes Bank to various entities in contravention of the law and in lieu of purported kickbacks given to the Kapoor family.
The CBI FIR had stated that during April-June, 2018, Yes Bank Limited had invested Rs 3,700 crore in the short term debentures of DHFL.
""Simultaneously, Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL paid kickback of Rs 600 crore to Rana Kapoor and his family members in the garb of loan of Rs 600 crore (given by DHFL) to DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd (Rana Kapoor group company).""
""In addition to the above, Yes Bank Ltd had also sanctioned a loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers, a group company of DHFL beneficially owned by Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and their family members,"" the ED alleged.
This loan of Rs 750 crore had been sanctioned to them for their Bandra Reclamation Project, Mumbai, but the entire amount was siphoned off by Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan through their shell companies, it said.
Rana Kapoor, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan have been arrested by the ED in this case and they are in judicial custody at present.
The agency had also filed charge sheets before a special court in Mumbai in this case.
The ED had earlier attached properties in this case and with this order, the total attachment in this probe stands at Rs 2,011 crore.",business

Ministry allows airlines to decide domestic baggage limits," The aviation ministry has allowed airlines to decide on baggage limitations for domestic passengers — an indication that the sector may resume normal flight schedules soon.
Passengers were so far allowed only one check-in bag on domestic flights since May 25.
Before domestic flights were suspended on March 25, Air India would allow check-in luggage of up to 25 kg and private airlines — with some limiting the number of bags — up to 15 kg for economy flyers.
“The matter has been reviewed based on inputs received from stakeholders. Considering the convenience of passengers, it has been decided to (allow)… baggage limitation according to airlines’ policies,” said an order issued by Usha Padhee, joint secretary in the aviation ministry.
Air India says it will now allow domestic passengers in economy and business class to check-in up to 25 kg and 35 kg, respectively.
Air India Express says it “permits 25 kg as checked-in (on domestic flights) and 7 kg as hand bags which continues”. Vistara said it will be “restoring the pre-Covid baggage allowance from Monday (September 28)… in response to the latest advisory issued by the government.”
Most airlines are likely to return to their piece concept (allowing one bag without extra charge and payment for subsequent checked in baggage) and a 15-kg weight limit. ",business
Harley-Davidson to discontinue sales and manufacturing ops in India," Harley-Davidson Inc said on Thursday it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India, effectively abandoning the world’s biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold.
The move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, some 70 redundancies and the closure of its Bawal plant, walking away from a market worth about 17 million bike and scooter sales a year. It will retain only a scaled-down sales office in Gurgaon.
“As part of The Rewire, an overhaul of its operating model and market structure, the company is changing its business model in India and evaluating options to continue to serve its customers,” a press release said.
The Harley-Davidson dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term. “The present contract term is till December,” said Adarsh Tulsyan, proprietor of the sole Harley Davidson dealership in Calcutta. 
The company has a total of 33 dealerships in the country. Tulsyan said he sold 100 motorbikes in a year on an average. “We are naturally disappointed. With the closure of the factory, the possibility of having new bikes is low. The news is yet to sink in. However, servicing of bikes continues.”
Last year, Ford Motor ceased independent operations in India by entering into a joint venture with M&M. General Motors, which stopped domestic sales in 2017, plans to stop manufacturing and exports from India by the end of this year. ",business
Maruti Suzuki India launches vehicle subscription programme," Maruti Suzuki India on Thursday launched its vehicle subscription programme for individuals to cash in on the festive demand even as a survey of car dealers threw up two key concerns —  support for future business evolution and to re-start business post lockdown.
Maruti Suzuki Subscribe will be launched initially in Delhi, NCR region and Bangalore. The company plans to extend this programme to  up to 60 cities in the next three years. 
The company has partnered ORIX Auto Infrastructure Services India, a subsidiary of Japan’s ORIX Corporation, to launch the service. 
Customers can choose to subscribe to a new Swift Dzire, Vitara Brezza and Ertiga from Arena showrooms and the Baleno, Ciaz and XL6 from Nexa dealerships. 
“Maruti Suzuki Subscribe allows a customer to use a new car without actually owning it by paying an all-inclusive monthly fee that covers maintenance, insurance and roadside assistance,” Maruti said. 
Dealer woes
FADA, an auto dealer association, said dealers were looking to rationalise their assets as well as manpower, especially in bigger cities, and also expect original equipment manufacturers to improve their profitability. 
“Dealers are moving to smaller places with lower rent and are also looking to rationalise manpower in order to carry forward in these challenges times,” FADA president Vinkesh Gulati said. ",business
Competition Commission approves Adani Group's Mumbai airport deal," The Competition Commission has approved Adani Group’s proposed acquisition of a controlling stake in Mumbai airport from GVK Airport Developers under the green channel route. 
The green channel route provides for automatic approval of certain deals, subject to various conditions. 
“The commission received the green channel combination pertaining to acquisition of GVK Airport Developers by Adani Airport Holdings,” the regulator said in a tweet. 
Adani Group had announced in August that it would acquire GVK Airport Developers’ (GVKADL) 50.50 per cent stake as well as buy out the 23.5 per cent stake of Airports Company of South Africa and Bidvest Group. 
Deals beyond a certain threshold require approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI). 
According to a notice filed with the watchdog, the acquirer proposes to take sole control of GVKADL through one or more steps, which will involve purchase of all external debt, conversion of the said debt to equity and purchase of its balance shares. 
Adani said there is no overlap in the relevant geographic market and there are also no vertical or complementary linkages between the activities of the group and GVKADL in India. ",business
Borrowing road map for fiscal second half on Monday," The government is expected to come up with a borrowing road map for the second half of the fiscal on Monday amid a raging debate whether it would raise Rs 4.34 lakh crore as planned or a higher sum to foot the burgeoning pandemic bill as tax collections moderate.
Some analysts said the government would wait till the third quarter was over when it would be better able to assess its revenue post the festive season.
Hard-pressed for funds to combat the rising coronavirus infections, the government in May increased its market borrowing for the current financial year by more than 50 per cent to Rs 12 lakh crore. In February, the budget had set a target to borrow Rs 7.80 lakh crore.
Aditi Nayar, principal economist, Icra said: “The government’s net tax revenues, non-tax revenues and disinvestment proceeds will together trail the FY2021 budget estimate by a huge Rs 6 lakh crore.”
“Moreover, expenditure will rise on account of the fiscal support announced under the ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, and the cash outgo for other items included in the First Supplementary Demand for Grants.”

She said the  fiscal deficit would widen to at least Rs 14 lakh crore this fiscal from the budgeted Rs 8 lakh crore. Accordingly, this entails a further expansion in the GoI’s borrowing calendar for the second half of at least Rs 1.1 lakh crore.  Borrowing plan: Rs 4.34 lakh cr
Why it may be inadequate: Sharp drop in revenue collections. One estimate puts additional borrowing of Rs 1.1 lakh crore
What can govt do: Can wait till third-quarter ends. Better assessment of revenues after festive season However, Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings, said: “It is unlikely to be more than Rs 12 lakh crore for the full year….therefore no surprise is expected.”
“The government would wait and watch the situation and take a call at the end of the third quarter of the current fiscal. The Covid-19 pandemic has created uncertainty on the demand spur in the coming months and the government would be cautious to watch out and take a call,” Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist in India Ratings & Research, said.
Collections suffer
Tax collections have taken a huge hit owing to lockdowns imposed since March to contain the spread of Covid-19. With GDP contracting a record 23.9 per cent in the first quarter, the expectations are that the government may have to announce additional measures to boost demand. ",business
Sensex slumps 1110 points over Covid second wave fears," Investors ran for cover and the Sensex slumped 1110 points on Thursday over fears of a second wave of the coronavirus triggering more lockdowns and derailing the global economy.
The Sensex suffered its biggest single-day fall since May 4 to end at 36553.60, wiping out Rs 3.95 lakh crore of investor wealth. The NSE Nifty tanked 326.30 points to close at 10805.55.
Market circles are divided on their forecasts: some are expecting a pullback but others are warning of a difficult period as recovery is far away and the much awaited vaccine is expected only next year.
Investors are not just spooked by the global factors. Back home, measures taken both by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the central government have failed to yield tangible results. 
The first stimulus package was a major disappointment. And the Modi government is holding off on a second round of fiscal measures, giving investors enough reason to stay on the sidelines.

Though the RBI is likely to maintain its accommodative stance and use unconventional tools to kickstart the economy such as targeted long-term repo, an interest rate cut is being ruled out at its forthcoming meeting given the elevated retail inflation.
Market circles said it was the negative global cues that led to stocks opening in the red and remaining under pressure through the session. There were apprehensions about global economic growth as the UK is set to go into a second lockdown and travel restrictions return in several countries in Europe.
Further, there were  mounting concerns over the recovery in the US with the weekly jobless showing a surprising rise on Thursday. There were more fears as the US Federal Reserve indicated it would not increase the size of its asset purchases amid fears that investors were poised to dump junk bonds.
“Investors have largely given up on the idea the US Congress will provide a new stimulus, while worrying about a recent rise in Covid-19 cases. Economists at Goldman Sachs cut their US growth forecast for the fourth quarter by half, to 3 per cent from 6 per cent,” said Deepak Jasani head of retail research, HDFC Securities.  
“Investors are bombarded by a perfect storm of problems including rising virus infections, new lockdowns, a slowing economic recovery, stalled US stimulus talks and election uncertainty.” 
Sliding for the sixth straight session, the 30-share BSE Sensex opened 37282.18 and fell below the 37000 mark to hit a day’s low of 36495.93 — a fall of 1172.44 points. It later settled at 36553.60 showing a drop of 1114.82 points or 2.96 per cent. The benchmark thus posted its biggest single-day fall since May 4 this year, when it had plunged over 2000 points.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty tanked 326.30 points or 2.93 per cent to close at 10805.55. The Sensex has now lost 2749.25 points in six days, while the Nifty has declined by 799 points. Barring Hindustan Unilever, which inched up 0.36 per cent, all Sensex components ended in the red on Thursday. ",business
Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India focuses on exports," Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) will focus on exports with its new range of BS-VI vehicles which are equivalent to the Euro-V emission norms of advanced markets.
At present, the company exports only three per cent of its total volume to a few countries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal. Talking to reporters, Atsushi Ogata, the new managing director, president and CEO of HMSI, said: “I have watched India transition from BS-IV to BS-VI, while working in Thailand. I have seen how HMSI has started to dispatch its BS-VI models. We now have the quality and capacity to deliver anywhere in the world. We can export completely built and completely knocked-down models. The percentage of exports will definitely see a substantial increase within three years.”
Ogata takes charge of HMSI in the midst of the pandemic. The new CEO remains optimistic about the two-wheeler market’s revival.

“We are witnessing a recovery in the high-speed market. The demand for motorcycles and scooters is beyond expectation. Customers are trying to get personal mobility to avoid mass transit. We see demand going back to normal sooner than later,” said the new CEO.
On his thoughts about the Indian market viz-a-viz the other markets that he has worked in, the president said: “India is a big market in terms of size and volume. It gives Honda an opportunity to grow. In markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam, Honda has a huge market share of 70-80 per cent. There are only Japanese makers there, no local or Chinese makers. In China, the major makers are from Japan who has to compete with copycat makers. In India, Honda has a marketshare of less than 30 per cent.”

Crude import falls 36%," India’s crude oil imports fell in July to their lowest since March 2010 as fuel demand slowed.
Crude oil imports last month slumped about 36.4 per cent from a year earlier to 12.34 million tonnes, or 2.92 million barrels per day, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the ministry of petroleum & natural gas showed.
The lower import marked a fourth straight monthly decline. Fuel demand in the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer also fell, posting a fifth consecutive year-on-year drop.
Analysts said state-run refiners, which control around 65 per cent of the refining capacity, have been forced to run at around 75 per cent of their capacity during the nationwide lockdown. Monsoon in several parts of the country also eroded some demand.
The consumption of petroleum products in July 2020 fell 11.7 per cent compared with July 2019 as volumes dropped to 15.7 mt in July 2020 from 17.7 mt in July 2019. Consumption between April and July 2020 contracted 22.5 per cent compared with the same period a year ago.

Data showed that crude oil imports decreased 23.6 per cent during April-July 2020 compared with the corresponding previous period.
“Lower economic growth means less demand for imports, which is already visible in our trade numbers,” analysts said.
Refined product imports surged 46.4 per cent to 4.07 million tonnes year-on-year, mainly due to a sharp jump in fuel oil imports.",business
G-Sec yields harden," Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond on Friday breached the 6 per cent mark as elevated retail inflation led to concerns that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue with its pause on interest rates.
The fall in government security prices (yields are inversely related to prices) comes at a time the corporate bond segment is showing some life with players such as Patanjali Ayurved tapping the market.
While bond prices had come under pressure after the outbreak of the coronavirus, aggressive interest rate reduction by the RBI and  enough liquidity from targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO) led to the softening of yields despite a Rs 12 lakh crore borrowing programme by the government.
However, high retail inflation amid forecasts that it would stay elevated have led to yields on government bonds rising from around 5.8 per cent last month. The RBI has not announced an open market operation (secondary purchases of bonds), which jacked up yields.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond on Friday ended at 6.08 per cent. Incidentally, it came on a day RBI governor Shaktikanta Das told a television channel that room still exists for an interest rate cut. He reiterated that policy space remains and that the central bank is only keeping its arsenal dry to use it judiciously in the future.

Earlier this month, Das had said that after Operation Twist and TLTRO improved the liquidity situation, spreads of three-year AAA-rated corporate bonds over similar tenor government securities have declined from 276 basis points on March 26, 2020 to 50 basis points on July 31, 2020.
He added that spreads on AA+ rated bonds softened from 307 basis points to 104 basis points, while spreads on AA bonds narrowed from 344 basis points to 142 basis points over the same period.",business
NCLT order to recover Rs 1200cr from Anil," The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday set the stage for insolvency proceedings against Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani after it appointed a resolution professional to recover Rs 1,200 crore from him under the personal guarantee clause of the bankruptcy law.
Anil Ambani had given a personal guarantee to the loans given by State Bank of India (SBI) to Reliance Communications (R-Com) and Reliance Infratel (RITL) in August 2016. Both R-Com and RITL had defaulted in the payments in January 2017 and the accounts were declared as non-performing accounts. SBI invoked the personal guarantee and issued an invocation notice on Ambani.
The NCLT order given on Thursday said that despite various correspondences between the bank and the personal guarantor no repayment was made on behalf of the latter.
“The applicant (SBI) apprehends that it would not be able to recover the claim amount from the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) or from the borrowers R-Com and RITL,’’ the order said. SBI had issued a demand notice dated February 20, 2020, to Ambani demanding payment. When he did not respond, SBI accordingly filed the petitions under Section 95 of the IBC.
According to IBC, the tribunal shall direct the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) within seven days of filing of such application to nominate the name of the RP. The IBBI will have to nominate a resolution professional (RP) within 10 days of receiving such a direction.
The order disclosed that Jitender Kothari has been appointed as the RP.
A spokesperson for Ambani said the industrialist was reviewing the order and was taking advice on filing an appropriate appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against the appointment of the RP.",business
Banks can do debt recast right away," Banks can hit the ground running on the debt resolution of accounts mauled by the Covid-19 pandemic without waiting either for the end of the existing loan moratorium on August 31 or for the K.V. Kamath panel to give its recommendations by the deadline of September 6, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.
Bank boards will decide by the end of this month on their eligibility criteria to decide which borrowers — retail and business —  will qualify for resolution.
Banks can pick and choose these borrowers based on their internal assessments and the broad criteria remains: that the account should have been recognised as a standard account on March 1 this year. The RBI had announced the new debt resolution norm earlier this month.
The banks can provide a debt resolution tenure of up to two years and decide whether or not to extend a moratorium of three, six or 12 months.
The Kamath committee will only deal with a certain class of business borrowers, having fund and non-fund exposure of over Rs 1,500 crore to the banking sector. It will decide on financial parameters only such as the debt service coverage ratio, the acceptable debt-equity ratio, and interest coverage ratio relating to a resolution scheme.
The entire process of submitting the report and the issue of the RBI’s notification will be completed in 30 days, which is September 6. Pre-Covid stressed accounts will need to be resolved under the RBI circular issued under June 7, 2019
Das told a TV channel that the six-month loan moratorium that ends this month was only a temporary relief and  the one-time restructuring mechanism which replaces it would help revive several units that are under stress because  of the pandemic.
Das said the new mechanism was drafted after lot of thought and the central bank considered both the health of the banks and the difficult conditions faced by individual and business borrowers. He pointed out that if nothing was done, bad loans would spike which will have an adverse impact on financial stability.
The RBI governor reiterated the latest resolution framework was only for Covid-19 related stress. “The moratorium was a temporary response to the lockdown.. but we need to find a durable solution where the retail and business loans are resolved,” he said. Das said three new members will join the rate-setting monetary policy committee to replace three external members whose tenures have come to an end.
An RBI panel will internally review how inflation-anchored policymaking mandate has worked. It will also review the need to widen the inflation targets using CPI (consumer price index), core CPI and WPI (wholesale price index). At present, it is entirely dependent on CPI combined with a mid-point of 4 per cent with a tolerance level of 2 per cent on either side. Das disclosed that such a review of the target will be done by the government. Under the 45ZA of the RBI Act, the government can reset the mandate every five years.
The monetary policy panel arrived at a status quo on rates earlier this month on August 6 after considering numerous factors  such as retail inflation, growth, food inflation, core inflation, wholesale prices and supply chain cost. The Reserve Bank is at the end of its rate cutting cycle as inflation is unlikely to decline materially from the current level, and the onus of economic recovery has now shifted to the government, economists at SBI said on Friday.
“Fiscal policy should play a decisive role, if we have to nurture any hopes of a fast-paced recovery,” the economists at SBI said.
“We now believe that we are at the end of the rate cut cycle and expectations of large cuts must be anchored as inflation is unlikely to decline materially from current level,” the SBI economists said.
They said large procurement by government could further push inflation up by 35-40 basis points.",business
Airlines seek government support," The civil aviation ministry will pitch for some relief to the battered aviation sector following several rounds of meetings with the airline operators.
Officials of the aviation  ministry plan to meet their finance counterparts to take up the proposal of the airlines, which includes loan waivers, soft loans and deferment of payment to airports for six months.
Sources said private airline operators such as SpiceJet, IndiGo, Air Asia, GoAir and Vistara have met the ministry officials several times since the Rs 20-lakh-crore stimulus package was announced by the government.
The package did not have any specific relief for the industry and the operators have been calling for some kind of sector-specific measures similar to the ones taken in other countries.
The ministry officials hope some hand-holding measures could be worked out for the sector.

They expect air bubble pacts to be signed with more countries and hope a reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases would spur air travel within the country.
Analysts, however, feel the finance ministry does not have much elbow room to offer relief. Any support is likely to be in the form of liquidity measures either through fiscal or monetary policies.
“The industry’s financial challenges will become increasingly apparent from September/October. Promoters, bankers, private equity and the government are all unwilling to provide support given the demand risk and uncertainty,” CAPA India said.
This could have an unprecedented impact on air connectivity, and on economic recovery. “The two critical elements for the industry to survive and navigate this crisis are demand (traffic risk) and capital,” it said.
Rating agency Icra said in a report that the domestic aviation industry had operated at a passenger load factor of 55 per cent in July against 86.3 per cent in the same month last year. 
“Icra maintains that the second half of 2020-21 will witness some recovery with the fourth quarter witnessing a contraction year-on-year of just 3-14 per cent in domestic passenger traffic with improved passenger load factor... Domestic passenger traffic is likely to contract 41-46 per cent in the whole of 2020-21,” it said.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said 2020 is the worst year in aviation, and airlines in the Asia-Pacific region alone are expected to report losses of $29 billion. Indian carriers are estimated to lose revenues of $11.61 billion in 2020 compared with 2019, and this is expected to impact 3.06 million jobs.
“On an average, every day of this year will add $230 million to industry losses. In total that’s a loss of $84.3 billion,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director-general and CEO, said.",business
Supreme Court fears loss of telco dues," The Supreme Court on Thursday said it was “extremely worried” that the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues of the telecom players under bankruptcy would be “wiped out” if they were allowed to proceed with their insolvency claims before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
The court had earlier in October 2019 directed the operators to cough up their dues — aggregating Rs 1.47 lakh crore — but operators such as Reliance Communications (R-Com) and Aircel had referred to their insolvency proceedings at the NCLT for their inability to pay the dues, which the apex court views as an attempt not to comply with its ruling.
“We are extremely worried that all AGR dues will be wiped out in the IBC process… After the spectrum sale, the new user will deny pending demands against the said spectrum,” Justice Arun Mishra, who heads the three-judge bench, said.
The bench, which includes Justices Abdul Nazeer and M.R.Shah, said, “Spectrum trading is different from spectrum sale under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code).  Nobody can use spectrum without paying past dues.”
Justice Mishra asked senior advocate Ranjit Kumar appearing for the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Aircel whether “liabilities be wound up under the guise of selling spectrum under IBC”.

However, Kumar defended the insolvency proceedings. He told the court that the insolvency laws in India were present from the 1920s. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is the latest amongst the evolving company laws, Kumar told the court.
He argued that spectrum is a raw material for the telecom service provider and was a valid security for banks.
According to Kumar, the various agreements signed earlier by the operators with banks and the government recognised spectrum as security before banks. Such payments due to the financial creditors should have a preference over operational creditors in the proceedings under IBC.
“Banks’ dues are similar to AGR dues, IBC doesn't allow AGR payment before paying banks. If all proceeds are used to satisfy AGR dues, banks won’t get anything, will lose public money. If government allowed spectrum as security, it can’t backtrack now. Even the ministry of corporate affairs wanted spectrum sale under IBC,” Kumar argued.
He argued that banks, government need to coexist. “Let's not forget the strain on the economy. Government uses proceeds for public, banks use it for economic purposes.”
The senior advocate argued that Section 238 of IBC prevails over any other law such as the Trai or Telegraph acts.
The senior advocate appearing for Bharti Airtel in his brief submission told the court that the company had paid all dues related to spectrum trading including the  Rs 18,004 crore of AGR dues.
The arguments would continue on Friday.",business
Telecom operations face greater licensing," The telecom regulator has floated a discussion paper on the unbundling of different aspects of telecom operations such as infrastructure, network, services and applications through differential licensing.
The consultation paper proposes a system of unbundling wherein there will be an independent network service provider/operator, which will establish the network and sell the services on a wholesale basis to the service delivery operator to retail.
The consultation paper, which asks for opinions of stakeholders on the issue, explains that unbundling of different layers would offer opportunities to share telecom resources and lead to optimum utilisation.
“This will further help in catalysing investment and innovation, cost-cutting, and effective utilisation of infrastructure,” Trai has said in the paper.
The consultation paper comes after the telecom department in May 2019 sought the regulator’s recommendation on the issue of unbundling of different layers.

Trai has set a deadline of September 17 for written comments and October 1 for counter comments on the issue.
“What incentives (lower licence fee, lower spectrum usage charges) could be provided to licensees in the new unbundled licensing regime to encourage the investment,” Trai has asked.
It has sought industry feedback on what should be the scope for network layer licence and service category licences in case the two elements are separated.
The regulator seeks to explore if a network services layer licensee should be permitted to take the service delivery category licence and the restrictions and safeguards that would be imposed to protect the competition and innovation in the service delivery segment.
“Out of various responsibilities and obligations enumerated in the unified licence, what should be the respective responsibilities and obligations of network layer licensees and service delivery category licensees,” said the consultation paper.
Trai had earlier come out with a pre-consultation paper on the issue where it sought inputs from stakeholders on the broad framework for unbundling of licence.
Other issues up for debate include whether certain obligations should be imposed on network layer licensees to provide the network resources in a time-bound, transparent and non-discriminatory manner, as also mechanisms to regulate the access to network services by the service delivery category licensees.
""Whether the existing Unified Licensees should be mandated to migrate to the unbundled licensing regime, or the new regime should be introduced, while keeping the existing regime continued for existing licensees till the validity of their licence, with an option of migration,"" TRAI asked.
Another question is on whether service delivery category licensees should be permitted to parent with multiple network service layer licensees.
The telecom department in May 2019, had informed that the National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) under its ''Propel India'' mission, envisages one of the strategies as ''reforming the licensing and regulatory regime to catalyse investments and innovation and promote ease of doing business''.
""Enabling unbundling of different layers (example, infrastructure, network, services, and application layer) through differential licensing is one of the action plans for fulfilling the aforementioned strategy,"" the TRAI release said.",business
Liquor firms asked to give cost breakup," The Bengal government has proposed a change in the sourcing policy of liquor asking companies to disclose information relating to a buildup of costs that will determine ex-distillery price.
The change comes as part of a 22-slab consolidated excise duty structure discussed with the industry on Wednesday, which is likely to come into effect from next month. The first slab for Indian-made foreign liquor and overseas liquor bottled in India is up to Rs 499 and the last slab is Rs 15,001 and above.
In the changed sourcing policy, when liquor firms have to re-register their brand and get a no objection certificate from the State Beverages Corporation.
In order to obtain that, certain disclosures such as a break-up of costs of materials that together determine the ex-distillery price (EDP) of liquor has to be submitted besides documents such as brand ownership certificate, trade mark registration and FSSAI licence. The government has also sought a comparison of EDP with other states.
The industry has welcomed the decision of the government to withdraw the Covid-19 related additional tax of 30 per cent. But the move to introduce slabs, comparing EDP with other states and confidentiality of cost data are key concerns.

“We welcome the move to simplify the tax structure by linking it with EDP though we think pricing slabs are far too many and may increase compliance burden. The decision to link EDP with that in other states is misplaced as it does not factor in local costs and tax structure in those states,” said Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies.
“We are also concerned whether the government has put in sufficient measures to protect confidentiality of the cost data that it is seeking from the companies. The privileged information should not fall in competitive hands,” he said.
The government has urged the industry to liquidate the current stock over the next two weeks so that the new duty can come into effect.
As part of the proposed changes, the margins for the wholeseller (the state beverage corporation) and the retailers are also expected to increase.",business
RBI scouts for escape hatch to kickstart economy," The Reserve Bank of India’s policymakers are grappling with a stark dilemma. If they do not cut interest rates, it may be hard to kickstart a moribund economy.
But inflation is ruling at 6.93 per cent and will run away unchecked unless the RBI raises rates — which isn’t an easy option to exercise in the current economic situation and will spark a caterwaul of protests if it does so.
The policy mandate requires the wise men on Mint Street to hold inflation at a mid-point of 4 per cent, with a tolerance limit of 2 per cent on either side. If inflation stubbornly stays above 6 per cent for three consecutive quarters, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das must write to the Centre and explain why the central bank failed to do its job.
The pandemic is a great excuse — but the RBI is understandably reluctant to admit failure. Retail inflation has stayed above 6 per cent for two quarters. In July, it surged to 6.93 per cent, which means it has two more months before it hands in a botched report card. It is this dilemma that seeped into the discussions of the monetary policy committee meeting held between August 4 and 6.
The minutes of the meeting, which were released on Thursday, show that the policymakers were casting about for an escape hatch to avoid having to make that dismal report of failure. The MPC noted that the imputed inflation numbers for April and May mark a “break in the CPI series”.
RBI deputy governor Michael Patra warned that if inflation persists above the upper tolerance band for one more quarter, the monetary policy will be constrained by the mandate to undertake remedial action — which means raise rates.
Ravindra Dholakia said imputation of the inflation numbers may provide misleading signals and it is prudent to ignore them and wait for more reliable estimates.",business
Tatas upbeat on Port Talbot," Tata Steel chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said the company was in “intense discussion” with the Boris Johnson government to find a sustainable and structural solution to the UK steel business of the company.
Facing a barrage of probing questions from the shareholders at the company’s 113th annual general meeting where they expressed doubts over the future of the European business, the chairman said the “hope and aim is to find a solution by the end of the fiscal year”.
Chandra said the company had a target to bring down debt to Rs 75,000 crore and have a debt-to-EBIDTA ratio of “3 or less” for a size and magnitude of the company’s operation “as soon as possible”, as shareholders questioned the elevated debt level of Tata Steel, which is over Rs 1 lakh crore now.
“It can be a matter of months before we can have a decision but if we have a successful outcome, then it is good. We are also thinking of alternative options. But our interest and focus is to see that we find a solution that is lasting,” Chandrasekaran informed the shareholders.
The statement comes amidst intense speculation over the future of the UK business as British media reported that the UK government has declined the request of Tata Steel to provide financial assistance. At least one potential suitor, Liberty House of Sanjeev Gupta, has said it was open to acquiring the Tatas’ UK steel business — including the main production site Port Talbot — if they sell it.

The Tatas’ operations in Europe are spread between the UK and the Netherlands, the latter being a more modern and efficient plant with positive contributions. Chandra explained that there was nothing wrong with the European business operationally.
“In Europe, the cost structure is such that we need a good spread, at least in excess of 260 euros (per tonne), which we have not been able to achieve. The last time we touched it was in 2018-19. But in 2019-20, it was around 230 euros per tonne. Now it is further lower to 200 euros per tonne. So, the steel price has to operate at a particular level to support that cost structure.

Govt to charge higher aviation security fee from Sept 1,"   The Civil Aviation Ministry has decided to charge higher aviation security fee (ASF) from domestic as well as international passengers from September 1, senior government officials said on Thursday.
Making the air travel slightly costlier, the officials said the ASF for domestic flyers will be increased to Rs 160 from Rs 150 starting next month, and international passengers will pay 5.2 USD instead of 4.85 USD as the ASF from September 1.
Airlines collect the ASF from passengers when they book their tickets and then give it to the government. The ASF is used to fund the security arrangement at airports across the country.
The ministry had increased the ASF last year too.

On June 7, 2019, the ministry said domestic passengers would be charged Rs 150 instead of Rs 130 as the ASF and international passengers would be charged 4.85 USD instead of USD 3.25 as the ASF from July 1, 2019.
The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.
All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave-without-pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash.
After a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25. However, the average occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.
Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
However, special international flights have been operating with the approval of aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).",business
Sales slide prods Bengal to review liquor tax," The Bengal government is considering a change in the tax structure after liquor sales dropped in the state following a 30 per cent additional tax it had imposed in April just after the lockdown.
The state may do away with the 30 per cent additional tax but there will only be a partial relief for tipplers as a rejig in the excise duty is also being planned with changes expected to come into effect from September onwards.
Industry sources on Wednesday said that circulars could be issued in a few days.
“The net impact of both is expected to inflate the pre Covid-19 prices by around 15-20 per cent against the flat 30 per cent rise because of the earlier duty. Overall, MRP is expected to go down slightly,” an industry source said.
Bengal was among the top five states in the country along with Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha that had drastically raised the duty on liquor to protect its revenues during the lockdown. But it turned out to be counterproductive as sales declined.

In Bengal there was an 84 per cent drop in sales by volume in April followed by a 35 per cent drop in May and the trend of year-on-year decline has continued in June and July. Before the Covid-19 hit, the state’s revenue collection per month was around Rs 1,000 crore, which declined by a third as MRP was jacked up by the additional duty.
A decrease in MRP will give a much needed boost to sales before the festive season but the excise duty change is also being considered as the government needs money as well.
The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, which comprises manufacturers such as Allied Blenders & Distillers, Amrut Distilleries, Mohan Meakin and Radico Khaitan, had urged the Bengal government to cut the additional duty to a level of not more than 5-10 per cent in order to prevent a downward spiral in liquor sales.
Moreover, the additional duty had jacked up the price of Indian-made foreign liquor in Bengal compared with the neighbouring states of Assam and Jharkhand, raising the fear of smuggling.",business
Indiabulls Group to exit realty," Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd (IBREL) and Embassy Group have signed a definitive deal to merge their various housing and commercial projects following which Embassy will take control of the merged entity. The transaction would lead to the exit of the Indiabulls group from the real estate business.
Embassy Group already has around a 14 per cent stake in IBREL. After the merger of the assets of these two companies, its stake will increase to 45 per cent.
The merger comes just days after a major resuffle at the top deck of Indiabulls Housing Finance with former RBI deputy governor S. S. Mundra being appointed as the non-executive chairman.
He replaced Indiabulls group founder Sameer Gehlaut, who has been re-designated as the non-executive, non-independent director of the company.
NAM Estates Pvt Ltd (NAM) and Embassy One Commercial Property Developments Pvt Ltd (NAM Opco), subsidiaries of the Embassy group, have entered into a definitive merger agreement with IBREL to amalgamate their ongoing, completed and planned residential and commercial projects with the latter.
Consequently, Jitendra Virwani along with the other promoter entities of NAM (the Embassy promoters) will become the new promoters of IBREL upon the completion of the merger and Sameer Gehlaut along with existing IBREL promoter group entities will  initiate the process of reclassification as required, the statement added.
The merged entity will have about 30 projects. It will create one of the leading market players among listed companies in the real estate sector in terms of surplus from launched projects, land bank ownership and residential stock.
The merged entity will be renamed Embassy Developments Ltd and it will have its headquarters both in Mumbai and Bangalore.
Under the terms of the agreement, IBREL’s shares are being valued at Rs 92.5 per share, a 25.7 per cent premium to Tuesday’s closing price.
NAM shareholders will get 6.619 shares of IBREL for every 10 shares of NAM, while NAM Opco shareholders will get 5.406 shares of IBREL for every 10 shares held in NAM Opco.",business
Skill gap in car parts," The auto components industry is facing a shortage of skilled manpower as migrant workers are yet to join work. Many manufacturers had to reskill new workforce on the shop floor.
Meeting productivity levels is becoming a challenge even with the current muted demand, said Deepak Jain, president of the Automotive Components Manufacturers’ Association of India (Acma) in a virtual press conference on Wednesday.
“There is enough manpower but they are not the same as in pre-Covid times. Contractual workers are not very skilled. So, two to three months are being spent to reskill.”
If there is a V-shaped recovery in the industry, then manpower might become a problem, said Vinnie Mehta, director-general, Acma.

Auditors wash their hands of SsangYong," Auditors for SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC) have refused to give an opinion on its half-yearly performance.
During the first quarter of this fiscal, the group incurred an operating loss of 98,634 million won and a net loss of 193,537 million won.
Auditors KPMG Samjong Accounting Corp had then said that the group’s current liabilities exceed its current assets by 589.87 billion won and that these conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
This comes at a time  Mahindra & Mahindra has decided to bring down its stake in the auto company to less than 50 per cent. The board had agreed to seek shareholders consent by way of a postal ballot. This would be a way to induct potential investors into SYMC or to otherwise meet its funding requirements through other sources.
M&M had recently indicated that it is not ruling out the possibility of ceding control over SYMC in full or in part.

Mahindra had acquired SsangYong in 2010 but has failed to turn it around.
According to M&M’s annual report for 2019-20, as of March 31, 2020, its investments in SYMC stood at Rs 2,450 crore while its ownership interest was at 74.65 per cent.

GST borrowing meet," The GST Council is likely to meet on August 27 to discuss the compensation payout to states and the opinion of the attorney-general on the legality of market borrowing to meet revenue shortfall.
Sources said the 41st meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council would be a single agenda meeting on states’ compensation to be held via video conferencing.
Besides, a full-fledged meeting of the Council would be held on September 19, agenda for which is to be decided in due course, they added.
The attorney-general — who is the chief legal officer of the government — has opined that the Centre has no statutory obligation to make up for any shortfall in GST revenues of states from its coffers , sources had said.
They had earlier indicated that following the AG’s opinion, states may now have to look at market borrowings to meet the revenue shortfall and the GST Council will take a final call.

The AG had also opined that the Council has to decide on meeting the shortfall in the GST compensation fund by providing the sufficient amount to be credited.",business
World Bank outlook dims," World Bank is likely to revise its earlier projection of a 3.2 per cent contraction in the Indian economy because of the spread of the coronavirus and a deterioration in the financial sector and global conditions.
In the latest release of its biannual India Development Update, the bank asked the government to maintain its reform momentum to spur private investment and exports and reverse the current slowdown.
“Challenges have emerged in recent weeks which are likely to weigh on the prospects in the near term. These risks include the spread of the virus; a further deterioration in the global outlook; and additional strains projected on the financial sector.
“Keeping these factors in mind, a steeper contraction may be projected in the revised outlook that will be available in October 2020,” it said.
The World Bank had in May projected that the Indian economy will contract 3.2 per cent in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021) and rebound slowly in the next financial year.

The bank’s projections are the most conservative estimate of the contraction. The IMF had said in June that the Indian economy would shrink 4.5 per cent but many others expect far steeper declines.
Various agencies and economists have given varying figures for India’s GDP contraction for 2020-21 and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said even nominal GDP would contract and if it did, it would be the first time since 1947.
The World Bank report expects India’s debt-to-GDP ratio to climb to 89 per cent from 66 per cent. But India is a lot better off than most western economies, including the US and Japan. It has advised India’s policy makers to scale back the priority sector lending guidelines — capped currently at 40 per cent of all advances. Earlier this month, the ambit was widened to cover start-ups. It also calls for relaxation in institutional investment rules.
The World Bank said the fiscal deficit of the central government was likely to increase to 6.6 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 and is expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent in the following year. Assuming that the states’ deficit is contained within 3.5-4.5 per cent of GDP, the combined deficit could rise to around 11 per cent in the current fiscal.",business
Adanis to run more airports," The Adanis have won a 50-year lease on three more airports after the Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal to farm out the airports at Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram through the public-private partnership (PPP).
Adani Enterprises had won the rights to six airports, including the three — the others are Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangalore — through the PPP model after competitive bidding  in February 2019.
In July 2019, the Union cabinet had approved the proposal to lease out the Ahmedabad, Mangalore and Lucknow airports to the Adanis.
“The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is not giving these airports permanently to the private operator. After running them for 50 years, the private operator would be handing over the airports back to the AAI,” information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
At present, all the six airports are owned and managed by the government-run AAI.

The minister said the AAI will receive Rs 1,070 crore as an upfront amount from the private operator for leasing the airports at Jaipur, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and this fund will be used to develop airports in smaller cities.
Seven months after the Cabinet approval, Adani Enterprises on February 14 this year signed the concessionaire agreement with the AAI for the operation, management and development of airports at Ahmedabad, Mangalore and Lucknow.
In June, the AAI gave three more months to the Ahmedabad-based company to take over the management of these three airports because of the Covid-19 situation. This means the deadline for the takeover has been pushed to November 12 from August 12. The cabinet has also decided to increase the minimum price sugar mills pay to sugarcane growers by Rs 10 to Rs 285 per quintal for the next marketing year starting October 2020.
In a statement, the government said FRP (fair and remunerative price) of Rs 285 per quintal has been fixed for a basic recovery rate of 10 per cent.
However, a premium of Rs 2.85 per quintal will be paid by mills for every 0.1 per cent increase above 10 per cent in the recovery, it said.
Also, the government has made a provision for reduction in FRP by Rs 2.85 per quintal for every 0.1 percentage point decrease in recovery, in respect of those mills whose recovery is below 10 per cent but above 9.5 per cent.
However, for mills having recovery of 9.5 per cent or below, FRP is fixed at Rs 270.75 per quintal.
“The determination of FRP will be in the interest of sugarcane growers keeping in view their entitlement to a fair and remunerative price for their produce,” the statement said.
The government estimates the country’s total sugar production to be at 28-29 million tonne in the current year ending next month compared with 33.1 million tonnes during 2018-19 due to a sharp fall in cane acreage in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The Centre also approved a proposal to give a one-time relaxation in the working capital limit for discoms as part of  the Rs 90,000cr liquidity infusion scheme.
At the press meet, Javadekar said, “There is a slump in power consumption. PFC and REC have been allowed to give loans above the limit...(of) more than 25 per cent working capital limit. This will increase the liquidity of the state discoms.”",business
DoT contests resolution plan," The DoT has opposed the resolution plan of R-Com and its subsidiary Reliance Telecom (RTL) citing it will not recover its dues from the plan proposed by the lenders .
The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is hearing the R-Com resolution plan on Wednesday, told the DoT to file an affidavit by Friday .
In March this year, the lenders of R-Com had given its green signal to a Rs 23,000 crore resolution plan. While Reliance Jio will get the tower and fiber assets of Reliance Infratel Ltd for Rs 4,700 crore, UV Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd (UVARCL) will get the spectrum for Rs 14,000 crore.",business
SC not to rule on IBC payout," The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it won’t go into the specific sharing of the dues of the financial creditors and operational creditors in a company under bankruptcy. It was more concerned with a bankrupt company’s claims on its ability to pay dues when under insolvency.
The court gave the opinion in the midst of an argument between the committee of creditors of Reliance Communications (R-Com) and the department of telecom (DoT) over who had the first right over the spectrum of the Anil Ambani-company, which is at present undergoing insolvency. R-Com owes a staggering Rs 25,000 crore in spectrum fees linked to adjusted gross revenues (AGR).
“We won’t go into apportionment of resolution plan funds between creditors,” the bench observed, meaning it was not concerned about the sharing of dues but rather the bona-fides of the insolvency claims of telecom players such as R-Com and Aircel.
The court made the remarks after senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the committee of creditors, said the licence agreement clearly mandated that spectrum was a fit case of security for banks.
The SBI-led committee of creditors (CoC) of R-Com on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that R-Com would go into liquidation if UVARC decided to withdraw from the acquisition proceedings if its right to the sale of spectrum was denied.

The submission was made by Salve, appearing for CoC, before a three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra which is examining whether bankrupt operators such as R-Com and Aircel can seek insolvency proceedings to apparently avoid compliance with the apex court’s October 2019 judgment, which mandated the various operators to refund a staggering Rs 1.47 lakh crore as dues in the form of AGR to the government.
UVARC had successfully bid for R-Com in the insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The The UVARC plan, approved by the CoC in March, involves the right to use spectrum under the control of R-Com.
“R-Com will go into liquidation if spectrum sale is not permitted… Even UVARC may back out of its bid if the DoT decides against spectrum sale citing IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code),” Salve told the bench also comprising Justices Abdul Nazeer and  M.R.Shah.
He was referring to the DoT’s argument that spectrum was a national asset and no telecom player can sell it to another party.
The CoC, on the other hand, has argued that the financial creditors should be given the priority as mandated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and not operational creditors such as the DoT, employees and other service providers of the company under insolvency law.
The court will take up the hearing on Thursday, with senior advocate Ranjit Kumar appearing for the CoC of Aircel.",business
Rules for National Payments Corporation of India rival," The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has set a net worth criteria of Rs 500 crore for an umbrella entity governing retail payments that will compete against the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
The central bank released the framework for setting up umbrella entities to operate pan-India retail payments systems. It had invited applications from eligible companies by February 26, 2021.
A policy paper put out by the central bank in January 2019 said that though the NPCI has become an organisation which is key to the operations of many of the critical retail payment systems of the country, there is “concentration of many tasks”.
The NPCI, which offers services such as UPI, IMPS and BHIM, is an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India. It was formed under the initiative of the RBI and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.
Companies with a net  worth of over Rs 500 crore will be eligible to set up an umbrella entity which will be permitted to set up, manage and operate new payment systems in the retail space comprising ATMs, White Label PoS, Aadhaar-based payments and remittance services.

The umbrella entity will be permitted to operate clearing and settlement systems for banks and non-banks. It will identify and manage relevant risks such as settlement, credit, liquidity and operational; and preserve the integrity of the system.
One of the key condition is that entities applying as promoter or promoter group will be owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens.
Capital requirements under Fema will apply for foreign investments in the applicant.
RBI added that if there is any Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in the applicant entity, it will fulfil, additionally, the capital requirements as applicable under the rules framed under FEMA.
The guidelines also elaborated on the 'fit and proper' requirements for promoters or promoter groups.
""No single promoter/promoter group shall have more than 40 per cent investment in the capital of the umbrella entity,"" the guidelines said.
The promoters or promoter groups should upfront demonstrate the capital contribution of not less than 10 per cent -- Rs 50 crore -- at the time of making application for setting up the umbrella entity.  The balance capital will be secured at the time of commencement of business/operations.
It further said the promoter or promoter group shareholding can be diluted to a minimum of 25 per cent after 5 years of commencement of business of the umbrella entity.
However, a minimum net worth of Rs 300 crore should be maintained at all times, as per the guidelines.",business
PwC lists 10 macro steps that can aid economic revival," PricewaterhouseCoopers India has listed 10 macro steps that can aid economic revival along with the downside risks in a research report released on Tuesday.
The macro steps include investment towards development of physical infrastructure, a targeted regional development for central and eastern states, strengthening exim logistics and processes, improving digital and agricultural infrastructure, promoting creation of MSMEs, improving healthcare, pharmaceuticals, transforming financial services and democratisation of learning through ed-tech sector.
The challenges include inadequate resources, lack of execution, weak last mile delivery and digital security risks.
“While strategies in organisations and policies in government are well constructed, translating them to on ground impact requires knowledge of last mile execution,"" the report said.
PwC had earlier set out three scenarios for India’s growth over a 20 year period ending in 2034. They were 6.6 per cent growth through rapid human capital and some infrastructure spend, 7 per cent growth with further infrastructure build and a 9 per cent growth trajectory with significant additional productivity improvement.

“If we can increase our average growth rate to 9 per cent from the pre Covid-19 five year average of 6.8 per cent and by deepening and widening of the economy make growth more inclusive, we can create 3 additional India’s with a cumulative additional GDP of USD 10 trillion, in a decade post recovery,” the report, presented by Shashank Tripathi, government strategy & transformation leader, PwC India said.

More air bubble pacts: Aviation minister," India is negotiating with 13 countries, including Australia, Japan and Singapore, to establish separate bilateral air bubble arrangements for international flight operations, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday.
Under a bilateral air bubble pact, airlines of both the countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions. Puri said air bubbles have also been proposed with neighbours Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan.
Since July, India has established such bubbles with the following countries — the US, the UK, France, Germany, the UAE, Qatar and the Maldives.
Puri said, “We are now taking these efforts forward and are negotiating with 13 more countries to establish such arrangements.”
“These countries include Australia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Bahrain, Israel, Kenya, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.”

Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The ministry of civil aviation will place a proposal for “further” privatisation of airports before the Union cabinet on Wednesday, Puri said.
In the first round, the airports in Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Guwahati were cleared for development through public-private partnership  model in February 2019.

Rs 110 lakh crore infrastructure challenge," The government is scouting for funds for the Rs 110-lakh-crore infrastructure projects planned over the next five years.
The Centre is considering the option of tapping the financial markets, global investors, and banks for the implementation of the projects.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had emphasised on these infrastructure projects during his Independence Day speech. However, the plans could go haywire if it cannot find the necessary resources.
The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) plans to spend Rs 110 lakh crore on nearly 7,000 projects across sectors such as transport, communications, urban development, energy and water. The plan is a grand vision involving private and state-run players and many believe it is too ambitious in its scope.
The identified projects across various sectors would help to create social and economic infrastructure to be implemented over the next five year.

According to official data, these projects include the Rs 3.66 lakh crore Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the Rs 1.08 lakh crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail corridor and the Rs 1.09-lakh crore North South Dedicated Freight Corridor.
The finance ministry is looking at various options for resource generation as the funding options suggested by the NIP committee seems to have gone awry due to the coronavirus pandemic which  posed a massive strain on central and state government budgets.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s virtual bilateral meeting with United Arab Emirates (UAE) Minister of State for Financial Affairs Obaid Al Tayer and urging the Middle Eastern nation to participate in India's ambitious Rs 111 lakh crore infrastructure project should be seen in this context, sources said.
Also, it would difficult get the private sector to participate in such infrastructure project with huge costs and long gestation period, analysts said.
Analysts also said project implementation capacity of state government has been hit hard due GST collections have halved and the central funds devolution has been delayed.
The investment envisaged between fiscal years 2020 and 2025 is a mix of private and public investment. While around 18-20 per cent of the pipeline is expected to be financed through the central government budget, around 24-26 per cent is expected to be financed through the state’s budget, the NIP report had said.
About 31 per cent of the required resources are to be raised through debt from bond markets, banks and non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), and around 4-10 per cent as equity from private developers, external aid multilateral and bilateral agencies and internal accruals.
However, a funding gap of around 15-17 per cent is estimated. To fill it, the task force suggests asset monetisation by the Centre and states and setting up of new development finance institutions (DFIs).",business
Uco Bank to raise funds," State-run Uco Bank has secured approvals from its board of directors and shareholders to raise Rs 3,000 crore capital this fiscal as the lender requires resources to grow and also provide for non-performing assets, an official said on Tuesday.
The capital will be raised at an appropriate time either through a public offer or a qualified institutional placement (QIP) or preferential issue, Uco Bank MD and CEO A.K. Goel said.
“We need capital for both growth and provisioning. Demand for credit is slowly recovering,” he said.
The bank’s provision coverage ratio (PCR) is more than 86 per cent, he said, adding that the asset quality scenario will be known after the moratorium on loan repayment is over by the end of this month.
“By the third quarter, we will be able to see what extra provisioning is needed. When the time will be conducive, we will raise capital. We are monitoring the market condition,” he said.

Goel also said an uptick in credit demand has been witnessed. “People are going for vehicle loans to buy cars to go to offices because of the pandemic. There is a slow recovery of credit off-take,” he added.
Speaking about the possibility of coming out of the restrictive prompt corrective action framework, Goel said meetings with the regulator could not be held in the current situation.
The Calcutta-based lender posted a net profit of Rs 21.46 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal. Both levels of the non-performing assets and the capital adequacy ratio by the end of the first quarter should enable the bank to come out of the PCA, he added.
Gross non-performing assets came down to 14.38 per cent of the total advances as on June 30, 2020, from 24.85 per cent in June 2019 and 16.77 per cent by the end of March 2020.",business
Telcos told to give data on priority plans," Telecom regulator Trai has asked Airtel and Vodafone Idea to submit all pending data post their priority plan presentation on August 10, as the regulator moves closer to finalising its views on the contentious issue, a source said.
The regulator recently sent reminders to the two companies to submit the additional data to back their claims, the source told PTI.
Following this, Vodafone Idea has sent some information and sought time till August 20 to submit the rest, while Airtel's response is awaited.
The source privy to the development said that the companies had made certain claims in the presentation before the regulator on August 10, and that Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) had asked all related data to be submitted. A reminder was sent this week to the two companies to make all pending submissions, and record of discussion has also to be circulated by Trai.
The regulator is expected to finalise its views in the next few days, the source added.
Trai has asked the two companies to give details on the source of data they presented, as also international reference or studies.
It has asked how the companies intend to accommodate disaster management and other emergency functions, especially keeping in mind needs of the Telecom Department and other agencies, given the backdrop of priority plans.

Tata Steel switches to 12-hour shift," Tata Steel’s Jamshedpur plant, which pioneered an eight-hour shift for workers in the country, will switch to an extended 12-hour schedule later this month to contain the spread of Covid-19.
The company received an approval from the Jharkhand government on Monday allowing the change which requires special exemption under labour law. Tata Steel said the proposed realignment would minimise the number of people who would enter and or exit the factory at any given point of time and also restrict large congregations on the shop floor.
“In view of the situation because of the Covid-19 outbreak we had approached the Jharkhand government to allow a 12-hour shift operation (from the existing eight hours). The primary objective of the request was to reduce the footfall of employees on the shop floor and also reduce the number of days of exposure of an employee to an outside home environment. The Jharkhand government has now exempted Tata Steel from various provisions relating to weekly hours, daily hours, intervals for rest under the Factories Act 1948,” said Tata Steel’s spokesperson.
Several other states had already allowed extended hours during the lockdown, including Odisha, where Tata Steel operates two large integrated steel plants such as in Jamshedpur.
The company had then switched to 12-hour shifts at Kalinganagar and Angul plants to limit the number of people inside the facilities. These units are now largely back to the eight-hour module.

According to the Jharkhand notification, an adult worker will be allowed to work in a factory at Tata Steel, Jamshedpur, for up to 12 hours in a day and 72 hours in any week, the spokesperson added.
The notification is in line under section 5  of the Factories Act, which states that during a public emergency that is threatening the security of the country or any part of it, whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbances, a state government may issue a notification to exempt any factory or class of factories from all or any provision of the Act, for a maximum of three months.
Set up in 1907, the Jamshedpur works comprise a 9.7 million tonne per annum crude steel production facility and a variety of finishing mills, employing  17,000 people on rolls and another 35,000 thorough vendors.
It was a pioneer in introducing an eight-hour shift way back in 1912, much before the Factories Act of 1948 (section 51 of the Act says- no adult worker shall be required or allowed to work in a factory for more than forty-eight hours in any week).
“We are planning shift patterns wherein we will reduce the footfall of employees on the shop floor and also reduce the number of days of exposure to not more than 48 hours in a week even with 12 hours shift, thereby also maintaining work life balance. We are in discussion with Tata Workers` Union to start a 12-hour shift as a pilot in two departments—sinter plant and new bar mill,” the spokesperson added.
President of the century old Tata Workers Union (one of the earliest trade unions of the country) R Ravi Prasad confirmed the development.
“We have got the information from the management and the 12-hour shift will roll out later this month on a pilot basis at the two departments and gradually across other departments. We are working out on the timing but initially it would be between 8 am and 8 pm and then between 8 pm and 8 am,” said Ravi Prasad.
Incidentally, the existing three-shift roster has employees working between 6 am and 2 pm, between 2 pm and 10 pm and then between 10 pm and 6 am.",business
Reliance Industries acquires Netmeds," Reliance Industries on Tuesday announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Netmeds, the Chennai-based online pharmacy, for a cash consideration of around Rs 620 crore.
Under the terms of the deal, RIL subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd will pick up a 60 per cent stake in Vitalic Health and a direct 100 per cent stake in three of its subsidiaries —Netmeds Marketplace, Tresara Health Private Ltd, and Dadha Pharma Distribution Pvt, the Mukesh Ambani-owned entity announced late on Tuesday night.
Speculation about the deal has been brewing for a while and it now sets the stage up for a battle royale in the online pharmacy space after Amazon launched its own venture that has already started accepting orders for both over the counter and prescription-based drugs in Bangalore earlier this week. It will also have to contend with existing players like 1Mg and Medlife.
Incorporated in 2015, Vitalic and its subsidiaries have been in the business of pharma distribution, sales, and business support services.
Netmeds connects customers to pharmacists and enables doorstep delivery of medicines, nutritional health and wellness products.

“This investment is aligned with our commitment to provide digital access for everyone in India. The addition of Netmeds enhances Reliance Retail’s ability to provide good quality and affordable health care products and services, and also broadens its digital commerce proposition to include most daily essential needs of consumers. We are impressed by Netmeds’ journey to build a nationwide digital franchise in such a short time and are confident of accelerating it with our investment and partnership, Isha Ambani, director, RRVL said while commenting on the strategic investment.
“It is indeed a proud moment for Netmeds to join Reliance family and work together to make quality healthcare affordable and accessible to every Indian. With the combined strength of the group’s digital, retail and tech platforms, we will strive to create more value for everyone in the ecosystem, while providing a superior Omni Channel experience to consumers,"" said Pradeep Dadha, Founder & CEO, Netmeds.
Apart from pharmacy, analysts say that Reliance Industries will also increase its focus on online learning in the coming months. In 2018, it acquired around 73 per cent in education technology provider Individual Learning Pvt Ltd (Embibe).
In 2018, a RIL subsidiary had invested in KareExpert Technologies, a digital healthcare platform. Then there is the JioHealthHub app which allows users to book a test, get check-ups and store health data.",business
Supreme Court doubt over AGR relief plan," The issue of whether a company under bankruptcy was liable to pay its dues to the government remained shrouded in claims and counter claims at a Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday on the adjusted gross revenues (AGRs) of telecom players, prompting the apex court to signal its unwillingness to accept the pleas of the operators to stagger their payment of Rs 1.47 lakh crore in the dues over a 20-year period.
The court said the 20-year grace period sought by the operators cannot be countenanced as the plea is vulnerable to “manipulation” and protracted litigation, to frustrate its October 2019 judgment that had mandated the refund.
“There are huge dues payable, how can we let it go? “We had directed payment within a certain period. The government is seeking 20 years, what if companies go into  insolvency?”
“In 20 years, all kinds of manipulation and legal filings can take place, we can't allow like this. Mr (Harish) Salve (counsel) you may raise technical points, but no technicalities will come in our way in enforcing recovery of AGR dues,” the bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Abdul Nazeer and M.R.Shah said.
The bench made the observation while examining  whether operators such as R-Com and Aircel can seek insolvency proceedings in an apparent bid to avoid compliance of the court’s October 2019 judgment for AGR dues payment.

The bench, which would continue hearing in the matter on Wednesday, was told by senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Jio and Committee of Creditors (CoC) of R-Com, that it would be premature to decide if spectrum can be sold or not under the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).  He said that only when the R-Com resolution applicant moves the Department of Telecom (DoT) for spectrum sale, the issue will be decided.
Salve argued that the insolvency proceedings against R-Com were triggered by Ericsson, which could not be withdrawn even after the Swedish company was paid its dues. He said the CoC has accepted a resolution plan which envisages auction of R-Com spectrum subject to DoT approval.
On the issue of whether Reliance Jio was liable to pay the dues of R-Com on account of a spectrum-sharing deal between them, Salve said “There is no question of one operator paying the AGR dues of another operator. Jio has already paid its relevant dues.”
On Tuesday, the top court had asked the Centre to clarify its stand on why Jio, which is earning revenue by sharing RCom's 800 MHz spectrum, be not asked to pay the AGR related dues to the government.
The Centre had told the top court there was a difference of opinion between the DoT and ministry of corporate affairs on  the sale of spectrum during insolvency proceedings.",business
People's Bank of China acquires stake in ICICI Bank," The People's Bank of China (PBOC) — the Chinese central bank — is using the portfolio route to pick up stakes in Indian companies amid the standoff between New Delhi and Beijing in Ladakh and the Modi government tightening its rules on foreign direct investment (FDI) from China.
After picking up a stake in the country’s largest pure mortgage lender HDFC, the PBOC has acquired a very small stake in ICICI Bank through the recently closed Rs 15,000-crore qualified institutional placement (QIP) by the country’s second largest private sector lender.
The PBOC was among 357 institutional investors that subscribed to the issue. Sources confirmed that the Chinese central bank had picked up shares worth Rs 15 crore.
Based on current market capitalisation, the stake of the PBOC in ICICI Bank is about 0.0065 per cent. The share price of ICICI Bank on Tuesday settled with gains of 2.54 per cent, or Rs 9.15, at Rs 369.40 on the BSE.
The Chinese central bank’s latest investment comes after it pared some of its stake in the first quarter of this fiscal in HDFC after a rise in tensions between India and China. It had earlier raised its stake in HDFC to above 1 per cent during the January-March 2020 quarter.

As its holding came below 1 per cent, the PBOC's name did not figure in the list of investors having a stake in the housing finance company as of June-end.
Central banks typically make investments in various asset classes including gold, foreign currencies and bonds, covering both government and corporate ones.
During the QIP of ICICI Bank last week, the Government of Singapore picked up 4.6 crore shares, representing 11.06 per cent of the total size on offer.
Other prominent investors included Morgan Stanley Investment Funds Global Opportunity Fund which picked up 7.31 per cent and Societe Generale-ODI, 5.55 per cent.
Proceeds of the issue will be used towards strengthening the capital adequacy ratio of the bank, improving the bank’s competitive positioning or general corporate requirements apart from any other purposes as may be permissible under the applicable law.
However, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) criticised ICICI Bank for allowing the PBOC to invest in the lender despite strong sentiments prevailing in the country against Chinese companies.
The CAIT said that this was the second such instance of the Chinese bank trying to make inroads into the Indian financial system after it made an investment in HDFC earlier this year.
The traders body asked the finance minister to direct both ICICI Bank and HDFC Ltd to return the investments by the Chinese entity.
The CAIT said in a statement that it has urged finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to take immediate cognizance of this matter and devise a policy framework to thwart China’s plans and protect the sovereignty of the banking system as also advise the RBI to take necessary steps immediately. CAIT secretary-general Praveen Khandelwal added that there is nothing concrete yet from the RBI to restrain and control the funds coming from China.",business
Liberty Group open to idea of acquiring Tata Steel UK assets," Liberty Group founder Sanjeev Gupta says he is ready to acquire Tata Steel’s Port Talbot facility if the opportunity arises.
Gupta, who was born in Ludhiana but spent two years of his childhood in Park Street’s Apsara Apartment when his parents moved to Calcutta, says: “The Tatas are very close to Liberty Group; always have been.
We have done many things together. We are always open for every type of co-operation with them.”
Asked if he would look at Port Talbot if it was offered by the Tatas, Gupta said: “Of course.” 
Gupta, executive chairman of UK-based GFG Alliance which includes Liberty Steel, spoke to The Telegraph a day after the media in the UK reported that the government and the Tatas had failed to agree on a financial rescue package for Tata Steel UK.

Gupta added: “We will look at any steel assets, not only Port Talbot, that may come our way in the markets we operate in.”
The London-based investor, known to pick up stressed assets, had bought Tata Steel UK’s speciality steel business for £100 million three years ago. 
Speculation about Tata Steel looking to sell its chronically loss making steel business in the UK that devolved from its $12-billion Corus acquisition in 2007 resurfaced after the Boris Johnson-led government refused to provide any bailout funds to haul the steel mill out of its Covid-induced crisis.
Asked if the pressure will mount on the Tatas to look for a buyer or induct a partner after failing to secure bailout funds, Gupta said he could not speculate on what the Tatas should or should not do.
However, Liberty appeared to have become a favoured port of call whenever large legacy integrated players look to shed flab. When ArcelorMittal was required to offload a few European mills to pass the competition control test before acquiring Ilva in Italy in 2019, Gupta was right there scooping up seven units spread across the continent.
Soon after, GFG brought steel operations in the UK, Europe and Australia under Liberty Steel, making it one of the top-10 producers outside China with a rolling capacity of 18 million tonnes (mt). After losing out on the big ticket acquisitions, Gupta plans to weave a string of pearls — mid sized assets close to a million tonnes — to mark a meaningful presence in India.
Liberty’s bids for Amtek Auto and Bhushan Power & Steel did not work out but it did manage to acquire a smaller one — Adhunik Metaliks Ltd, which used to be based in Calcutta and had plants in Odisha.
Gupta said he would not be satisfied with Adhunik alone and was looking to acquire a few more steel assets over the next 12-18 months. Going forward, he would also venture into renewable energy.
“India will be a hub for Liberty for sure. We would like to see at least 5 million tonnes (steel) in the next five years, organically or inorganically. Liberty wants to be a meaningful player and below 5 mt, it won’t be in a big market like India,” Gupta said.
GFG — acronym for Gupta Family Group — Alliance, which had a lofty target to become a carbon neutral steel producer by 2030, will prefer coastal assets — in the southern and western parts of India — to inland ones, to take the benefit of Liberty’s global value chain. 
Gupta, however, understands the importance of a good start. 
“A successful start of Adhunik will give us confidence and it will help us to build on it. Lot of revamping has been done (in Adhunik). We are, of course, delayed a bit due to Covid. Initially, we would like to get to existing capacity of half a million tonne and then expand it to a million tonnes later,” Gupta said.
“We perhaps underestimated the diligence process. It is a more complicated market for sure and we underestimated those complications. But we have very good understanding in running a business in India,” Gupta said. 
“I would like to come every month. But our movement is now restricted due to Covid.” 
Would he like to visit Calcutta too? Gupta said he did, and two years back he went up to Apsara Apartment and knocked on the very flat where he spent a couple of years. 
“I used to live here,” he had told the bemused current owner of the property.",business
Trai issues spectrum usage charges sop," In a relief to operators, the telecom regulator has said spectrum usage charges (SUC) will be levied only on the shared spectrum band and not on all the bands of a licensee.
Regulator Trai clarified that in cases involving the sharing of radiowaves, the stipulated increment of 0.5 per cent on the SUC rate should apply only on the spectrum held in the specific band where sharing is taking place and not on the entire spectrum holding of the licensee.
The telecom regulator has also recommended that suitable exit clauses for the termination of existing spectrum-sharing arrangement by the operators be included in the spectrum sharing guidelines. 
At present, companies pay 3-5 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue  as spectrum usage charge to the department of telecom.
If they share spectrum with another operator, operators must pay an additional 0.5 per cent of AGR for that band as SUC.

The recommendations are the outcome of a consultation paper titled “Methodology of applying spectrum usage charges under the weighted average method of SUC assessment in cases of spectrum sharing” that was floated by Trai in April this year.
At present, companies pay 3-5 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as spectrum usage charge to the department of telecom. If they share spectrum with another operator, operators must pay an additional 0.5 per cent of AGR for that band as SUC. 
In January, the telecom department had said the existing norms for sharing of access spectrum by operators provide that the SUC rate of each of the licencees post sharing increases by 0.5 per cent of the AGR.
The Department of Telecom (DoT) also informed that it has received representations requesting that incremental SUC rate of 0.5 per cent post sharing should be applied only to the particular spectrum band which has been allowed to be shared between the two licencees and not on the entire spectrum held by licencees, since sharing is allowed in a particular band.
It is in this background that DoT requested Trai to furnish its recommendations on whether the incremental 0.5 per cent in SUC rate in cases of sharing of spectrum should be applied only on the specific band in which sharing is taking place; or on the overall Weighted Average Rate of SUC, which has been derived from all bands.
The two prominent spectrum sharing arrangements were between Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Communications for the 800 MHz spectrum owned by the latter, and Tata Teleservices sharing its spectrum in 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz in around half a dozen circles with Bharti Airtel.
While Reliance Jio acquired some spectrum in the 800-Mhz from Reliance Communications before it shut shop, Bharti Airtel acquired all the spectrum along with the entire consumer mobile business of the Tata group.",business

RBI lifts freeze on Bandhan Bank CEO remuneration," Bandhan Bank on Monday said the RBI has lifted its freeze on the remuneration of the bank’s managing director and CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh.
The RBI on September 19, 2018, had imposed two restrictions on the city-based bank for non-compliance with its licensing conditions — opening of bank branches without the central bank’s prior approval and freezing the remuneration of the MD and CEO at the existing level.
According to the licensing conditions, the bank was supposed to bring down the promoter holding to 40 per cent of the total paid-up voting equity capital within three years from the start of operations, that is by August 22, 2018. 
The bank amalgamated Gruh Finance Limited with itself effective from October 2019 and the shareholding of the non-operative financial holding company (NOFHC) was subsequently diluted to 60.96 per cent from 82.23 per cent. The bank further diluted the NOFHC holding through secondary market sale earlier this month.
“Considering the progress of the dilution of excess shareholding of NOFHC in the bank, RBI vide its letter dated February 25, 2020, has withdrawn the restriction imposed for obtaining prior approval of RBI for opening of banking outlets,” Bandhan Bank told the stock exchanges.

HDFC Bank faces US lawsuit following allegations of misleading investors," US-based Rosen Law Firm on Monday said it planned to investigate potential securities claims against HDFC Bank following allegations of sharing “materially misleading business information” with investors.
Reacting to the development, a spokesperson of HDFC Bank said in an interim response that the lender is unaware of any such class action lawsuit. 
“We are getting details of it. We’ll examine it and respond to it as appropriate. Prima facie it does look frivolous as we believe we have been transparent in our disclosure,” the spokesperson added.
“Rosen Law Firm is preparing a securities lawsuit on behalf of HDFC Bank shareholders,” the global investor right law firm said on its website.
Citing some news reports about alleged unfair business practices and that the lender had missed analysts’ estimates on profits for the first quarter ended June 30, Rosen Law Firm said it was preparing a securities lawsuit. 
The reports related to the private sector lender conducting a probe into the allegations of improper lending practices and conflicts of interests in its vehicle-financing operations involving the unit’s former head.
The HDFC Bank American depository receipt share price fell 2.83 per cent following the report, it added. 
The law firm said it will investigate “potential securities claims on behalf of the shareholders of HDFC Bank Ltd resulting from allegations that the bank may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public”.
Last year, Rosen Law had prepared a similar class-action suit against Infosys after a whistleblower had alleged malpractices by a few key management personnel. The suit was dismissed in May this year. “If you purchased securities of HDFC Bank please visit the firm’s website...to join the securities action,” Rosen Law Firm said.
Last month, HDFC Bank had launched a probe on its vehicle finance lending practices following allegations against the conduct of a key executive in the auto lending business. However, the bank said that this probe will not have any bearing on the loan book, or will not cause any loss to the bank.
Speaking to shareholders at its annual general meeting, Aditya Puri, HDFC Bank managing director and CEO, had said that the bank had received a whistleblower complaint and subsequently, it conducted an internal investigation into the auto loan business. Following this, the bank had taken action against some employees.
Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation, according to its website.
Shares of HDFC Bank on Monday ended marginally lower at Rs 1033.55.

RBI's recap skip call," The government may not have to inject fresh capital into the public sector banks (PSBs) as the one-time loan restructuring permitted by the RBI has reduced additional fund requirement by them.
Also the poor credit offtake on account of the coronavirus pandemic may obliterate the need for significant growth capital during the current fiscal, sources said.
There may not be a sudden surge in non-performing assets (NPAs) after the six-month moratorium comes to an end this month as it is followed by a one-time loan restructuring, sources said, adding, provisioning requirement is also quite low for the debt recast accounts.
Moreover, most of the public sector banks have taken approval in advance to raise tier-I and tier-II capital during the current fiscal depending on the need.
Despite all these, sources said, if at all there is a need for regulatory capital requirement by some public sector banks towards the end of the current fiscal, the government will provide that like it has done in the past.

Inflows resumed in April at Rs 731 crore, followed by Rs 815 crore in May.
“Gold prices continued to scale new highs on the back of weakness in the dollar, tension between the US and China and consistent rise in Covid-19 cases globally, which boosted its safe-haven appeal,” said Himanshu Srivastava, associate director-manager research at  Morningstar India.
“With all major economies staring at recession due to the spread of coronavirus pandemic, gold, expectedly, has emerged as one of the best performing asset classes and a preferred investment destination among investors,” he added.
Srivastava further said the surge in coronavirus cases has cast a doubt on the swift recovery hopes and investors continue to hedge their exposure to riskier assets by investing a portion of their assets in gold, as it is seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.",business
Industry felt impact in last fiscal," As many as 159 companies listed on the BSE cumulatively saw a decline of Rs 22,538 crore in their EBITDA in the three months ended March 2020 compared with the December quarter, reflecting an early impact of the coronavirus pandemic, says a report. 
EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
For the report, leading consultancy EY India analysed March quarter results of the top 300 BSE-listed companies and 115 global firms spanning over 12 sectors to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 disruptions on their reporting calendar, profitability, financial position, liquidity, disclosures and other key parameters.
“The analysis relies on the details of the pandemic’s impact as presented by companies in their results or any public document pertaining to their quarterly reporting,” EY India said.
It was done for the March quarter results of top BSE 300 companies that were announced till June 5.     
Most of the companies experienced a material impact on financial performance indicators such as EBITDA, revenue, debt and interest service coverage, provisions, profitability as and earnings per share (EPS), it noted.
According to the report, 159 BSE 300 companies saw Rs 22,538 crore decrease in EBITDA in the March 2020 quarter compared to the preceding December quarter, 2019 “as early impacts of pandemic and resulting changes in macro-economic factors,” EY India said.

SUV appeal endures during pandemic," SUVs are blazing the roads amid the debris of the pandemic.
As many as 12 of the 18 models launched since March have been SUVs or SUV bodytypes, braving a downturn in the market that is consistently reporting falling sales month-on-month.
Car makers have lined up another 27 models by the end of the calendar year — of which 15 will be SUVs, taking the number of planned launches to 27 in just nine months.
The industry, on the other hand, continues to be sucked into the vortex of a slump  with July sales down over 30 per cent. Manufacturers, however, have taken it on their chin as they lure customers with fresh launches every month.
Analysts said consumers are downgrading their choices with the contraction in the economy and falling incomes. “But once the pandemic is over, people will go back to their preferred vehicle, that is the SUV,” an analyst said.

Shashank Srivastava, executive director, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, pointed out the markedly different type of SUVs favoured by the buyers.
“In India, SUVs have a different connotation altogether. It is not the 4x4 offroader that is the choice of the consumers here,” he said.
“Rather it is the urban SUV, a 2x2 avatar with SUV bodystyle that is favoured. And why just India, SUV bodystyle is the choice all over Europe, China too,” Srivastava said. Maruti has the S-Presso, Ignis, XL6 with an SUV-ish design.
For Hyundai, it is the SUV that is giving the company its numbers. The new Creta launched in March has garnered 65,000 bookings with 60 per cent of  the sales coming from the diesel variant.
Tarun Garg, director (sales, marketing & service), Hyundai Motor India Ltd,  said, “Hyundai Creta has redefined the SUV landscape since its launch in 2015 and has crossed 5-lakh sales mark.”
Hyundai sold more than 34,000 units of the Creta, Venue, Tucson and  Kona Electric. The Korean company has products in all the segments, including the hatchback and sedan, but is betting big on its SUV range because of its high profitability, Garg said. 
Toyota Kirloskar India Limited (TKIM), which is poised to launch its first compact SUV Urban Cruiser this month, is seeing a revival at the lower end of the market.
“The market composition is veering towards what it was five years ago with compact cars seeing a revival of sales,” said Naveen Soni, senior vice-president, sales and service, Toyota Kirloskar.
The Japanese  company is witnessing a growth in the lower end of its product range with the Glanza comprising 25 per cent of its sales. Both the Glanza and the upcoming model Urban Cruiser are cross-badged vehicles from Maruti.
“In a contracting industry, Glanza has been able to hold on to its sales of 2,000 units per month. We think the Urban Cruiser, an A segment SUV, will be a good enabler in the current market,” Soni said.
For Tata Motors, it’s the compact SUV and the premium hatchback that are seeing good numbers. “The number of first time car buyers is very high in the market. Also people are buying additional cars preferring personal mobility to mass transit. These first time buyers are opting for compact SUVs or premium hatches priced Rs 5 lakh upwards. The segment below Rs 10 lakh is growing,” said Vivek Srivatsa, head of marketing, passenger vehicle business unit, Tata Motors.
Kia Motors, which had a dream debut with the SUV Seltos in the top 10 bestselling list every month, will have its compact SUV Sonet in the market in September. The other entrant to the market, MG Motors, has launched its six-seater Hector Plus and is gearing up to launch the MG GS.",business
NBFCs suffer from cash flow mismatch," Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) could face a cash flow mismatch with the Reserve Bank of India allowing a one-way restructuring of advances, a senior industry representative said.
NBFCs are concerned over falling cash inflows following the moratorium to its clients even as they repay the banks for their borrowings which are not under moratorium.
Sunil Kanoria, vice-chairman, Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd, said the proposed restructuring programme was designed without any consultation with the industry. “NBFCs are not manufacturers of goods; they borrow money from banks and from the wholesale market,” Kanoria said.
Since NBFCs have been directed to offer moratorium to their clients and are expected to restructure the loans of their customers, it is only fair that they should be allowed to get their borrowings restructured, Kanoria said, adding “otherwise, it will create serious mismatch in their cash flows”.
He said a representation has been made to the RBI requesting the regulator to address the anomaly of the cash flows to ensure the financial stability of the NBFC ecosystem.

Kanoria said a loan should be restructured after assessing the financial position and future cash flow of the borrower and should not be restrained with timelines and portfolio sizes.
While announcing the one-time restructuring of MSMEs, the RBI has fixed the aggregate exposure of the borrower at Rs 25 crore as on March 1, 2020 and mandated the restructuring to be done by March 31, 2021.
“If deadlines have to be set, it should be liberal, till at least March 2022. We should also wait for the expert committee, led by K.V. Kamath, to make suggestions,” Kanoria said.
He said some large NBFCs backed by the government may be able to steer their operations through the pandemic, but others would have to work out strategies.
Many NBFCs, including Srei, have been selling portfolios and banks flush with liquidity have been the major buyers.
Despite the challenges, deepened by the IL&FS defaults and overall risk aversion from the banking sector, the borrowings of the NBFC sector from the banks have shown an uptrend. RBI data show that the share of long-term market debt in the total borrowings of the NBFC sector has declined from 49.1 per cent at the end of March 2018 to 40.8 per cent at the end of December 2019.
The funding gap was met through bank borrowings that rose from 23.1 per cent to 28.9 per cent over this period.
Kanoria said that while a consolidation of NBFCs may not be an ideal solution, the regulator can encourage mergers between banks and systemically large NBFCs.
“It has happened in the past and there are success stories from such mergers. This will provide a long-term solution to the current liquidity conundrum for NBFCs and will help in expanding the reach of banking services to larger numbers of SME and MSME customers,” he said.",business
Gas price may fall below $2," Prices of natural gas in India are likely to be cut to $1.9-1.94 — the lowest in more than a decade — from October, denting the revenues of producers such as ONGC who are already incurring huge losses on production.
A price revision is due from October 1 and going by the changes in the benchmark rate in gas exporting nations, the price is likely to be anywhere between $1.90 and $1.94 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), sources privy to the development said.
This will be the third straight reduction in rates in one year. Prices were cut by a steep 26 per cent to $2.39 per mBtu in April.
Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertiliser and generate electricity and is also converted into CNG for use in automobiles as fuel and cooking gas for households, are set every six months — on April 1 and October 1 each year.
Sources said the cut in prices would mean a widening of losses for India’s top oil and gas producer ONGC.

Earlier this month, India and the UK signed a bilateral air pact, under which the airlines of both the countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions. India had signed similar bilateral pacts with Germany and France in July.
Vistara got its second B787-9 wide-bodied aircraft on Saturday. It had received its first B787-9 aircraft in February.
“Vistara has already got the slots at the Heathrow airport in London. The flights between Delhi and London are likely to be announced in the next few days,” an industry source said.
The Delhi-London flight is likely to operate thrice a week, the source added.

A wide-bodied aircraft has a bigger fuel tank that allows it to operate long-haul flights. Vistara has 43 planes in its fleet, of which 41 are narrow-bodied aircraft such as A320neo and B737-800NG.
The full-service carrier is also likely to operate flights between India and Germany and India and France, another aviation industry source said, adding that the probable destinations for these flights are Frankfurt and Paris respectively.
It is not clear which Indian cities will be connected to Frankfurt and Paris by Vistara. The private carrier did not respond to the queries.
Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The aviation sector has been significantly impacted because of the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic.
All airlines in India have opted for cost-reducing measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to conserve cash.
India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25 after a gap of two months. The airlines have been allowed to operate a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights. However, the occupancy rate in the domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.",business
"Brace for hard times, warns Kumar Mangalam Birla"," Kumar Mangalam Birla has said the country’s GDP may not only contract in 2020-21 but the next few years are also likely to be characterised by difficult conditions even as there could be other post-Covid changes reflected in consumer behaviour and the operating models of companies.
Birla, who is one of the country’s leading industrialists with diversified interests ranging from commodities and telecom to financial services, said in a letter to shareholders that while the domestic economy may witness its first contraction in more than four decades in this fiscal, some scars from the current pandemic would last longer for the world economy in the form of subdued consumer and business confidence.
Some sectors, such as airlines and hospitality, will take time to recover fully, while some supply chain disruption effects will linger.
He pointed out that as the world emerges from the current crisis, the next few years are likely to be marked by a lack of buoyancy in growth, subdued commodity prices and inflation, a cautious trend in project investments, heightened risks of de-globalisation and political uncertainty; and increased dependence of financial systems on ultra-loose monetary policy conditions.
“We will also have to watch out for potential post-Covid changes in consumer behaviour (such as more virtual engagements) and of the operating models of organisations (such as work-from-home norms, diversification of supply chain risks, more use of e-commerce),” he added.

Birla, thus, joins the list of several economists who are forecasting a challenging year for India with recovery only expected next fiscal. While experts feel that the Indian economy may show a double-digit contraction in the first quarter of the fiscal with some estimates even putting it at over 40 per cent and that for the year as a whole, it may shrink by over five per cent.
According to Birla, Covid-19 struck India at a time the underlying economic conditions were subdued on account of heightened global uncertainty and stress in the domestic financial system. A stringent national lockdown to slow the spread of the pandemic started in the last week of 2019-20 and remained active in varying degrees in different geographies through most of the first quarter of 2020-21.
“It is estimated that about 80 per cent of India’s GDP originates from districts which were classified under the red and orange zones during the lockdown, where economic activity remained severely constrained,” he said.
The Aditya Birla group chairman added that though the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have taken various measures to stabilise the economy and boost growth, the Indian economy — like the global economy —will still need to navigate through some difficult quarters.
Given the fog of uncertainty all around, it is hard to be prescient in these times, Birla added. Steel demand is expected to decline significantly in 2020-21 in line with a projected contraction in the global economy due to the impact of coronavirus pandemic, Tata Steel has said in its annual report.
Most of the steel producing regions are expected to witness a decline in crude steel output due to production cuts amid the ongoing lockdowns, Tata Steel said.
The global economic growth is expected to see a contraction of over 3 per cent in 2020, Tata Steel chairman N. Chandrasekaran said, terming the slump as the “worst contraction” since the 1930s.
A contraction in global GDP is not a good sign for the steel sector as steel demand is positively correlated with the economic growth.
“Global GDP growth eased to 2.9 per cent in 2019 against an initial growth projection of 3.5 per cent... As we look ahead, it is important to gauge Covid-19’s unprecedented impact on the global economy. It is expected that global growth will contract by over 3 per cent in 2020, the worst contraction since the 1930s,"" Chandrasekaran said in the Annual Report for 2019-20.
“But there is little doubt on one reality: companies with quality leadership, sound business fundamentals and a track record of winning in turbulent times, will emerge as champions in the new global order,” he said.
This year will see an economic contraction, but this 2020 recession is turning out very different from the past recessions, he observed.
Birla was, however, quick to add that on the positive side, this recession is likely to be one of the shortest, assuming no second wave of the pandemic recurs. As present lockdowns around the world get lifted, and businesses reopen, economic activity is likely to bounce back fairly quickly.",business
Gold is on a roll," Since the beginning of 2019, one asset class has emerged the clear winner. It’s gold. Ten grams of 24k gold cost around Rs 32,500 in January 2019. Since then, there’s been a nearly 70 per cent appreciation, with gold future prices appreciating to over Rs 57,400. Gold had flatlined for nearly a decade.
But global economic uncertainty started driving it up again before the explosive growth with the arrival of a global pandemic. The pandemic continues to disrupt daily life and economic adversities continue to compound in many economies. It is expected that gold will continue to do well in the near future. So what should the small investor do? Gold thrives in economic uncertainty. During those periods, while everything else crashes and burns, gold shines. Investors use it as a hedge against uncertainty, volatility and inflation. To them, gold is insurance. If global stock indices are crashing, you may be able to stabilise your portfolio through gains in gold. With fiat currencies becoming less valuable in developed countries, people’s faith in the metal may continue to increase.
According to Goldman Sachs, a weakening dollar and falling interest rates could push gold prices up from the current $1,930 per ounce levels to around $2,300 in the next 12 months.
Others see it going higher. “Gold has entered a bullish phase that can last several years,” said The Arora Report.
“There is better than 50 per cent probability of gold approaching $3,000 in this cycle.”
Jefferies believes it could rise to $4,000. Clearly, there’s a belief that prevalent instabilities will keep driving up prices. Investors who had been buying gold through the recent past have gained immensely from the ongoing rally. But for new investors looking to get in, the growth prospects are unclear. Therein lie the risks and rewards. You can invest according to your risk appetite to cash in on short-term trends.
However, from a long-term perspective, it would be wiser to buy small quantities of gold regularly and systematically. For example, you could buy a gram every month for several years. This would slowly help you create a gold corpus while lowering price-related risks. By the time another global economic crisis comes along, the gold you have slowly accumulated will give you stability. The key with buying gold is having just enough to stabilise your portfolio during times of volatility but not so much as to drag your wealth growth during periods of prosperity. In ten-year periods starting August 1980 and ending August 2010, gold grew at approximate annual rates of -5.20 per cent, -2.63 per cent, and 15.85 per cent considering absolute prices.
In the 10 years since then, it grew at 4.61 per cent. Between August 2012 and August 2018, it flatlined at -0.2 per cent. Over the next two years, it would grow at 32 per cent.
The point here is that gold flatlines for long periods of time but can grow in short, explosive bursts. If you have too much, you may not achieve growth for prolonged periods. If you have too little, it will not make a meaningful impact on your portfolio during periods of volatility.
Many experts believe gold should constitute 5-10 per cent of a portfolio. This is a useful yardstick. However, you can pick a number based on your own unique situation after assessing your risk appetite, investment goals, and liquidity needs. The obvious and traditional choice is to buy gold in its physical form, be it jewellery, coins, bars or something else. You could buy them from your preferred shop or even online via reputable sellers. This option is also useful from the point of using the gold.
However, you need to factor in making charges, applicable taxes, concerns over purity, and costs of safe storage into your investment objectives.
If you’re looking at gold purely as an investment, you must also consider buying gold exchange-traded funds, gold mutual funds or Sovereign Gold Bonds.
ETFs and MFs can be easily bought online from the fund house of your choice, while the SGBs can be bought several times a year from authorised banks, stock exchanges, or online trading platforms.
As a long-term investment, the SGB scores over other options because of sovereign guarantee, tax-free returns on maturity, and an additional interest income on the price which is the icing on the cake. You could also buy or sell digital gold through authorised payment apps.
In conclusion, while the investment opportunity in the coveted yellow metal may seem hard to overlook, one must approach the decision-making process in a pragmatic manner — both in terms of investment amount and investment mode.

ICICI raises Rs 15000cr through QIP issue," ICICI Bank, the country’s second-largest private sector lender, on Saturday said it has raised Rs 15,000 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) after completing the allotment of equity shares under the offering.
The proceeds from the issue will be used to strengthen the capital adequacy ratio of the bank and improve its competitive positioning or general corporate requirements. Investors were allocated 41.89 crore shares at an issue price of Rs 358 per share.
“The issue price represents a 1.9 per cent premium to the floor price determined based on the pricing formula as prescribed under Regulation 176(1) of the Sebi ICDR Regulations and a discount of 1.5 per cent to the closing price of the bank’s equity shares on the BSE/NSE prior to the launch of the issue,” ICICI Bank said in a statement.
Earlier this week, the bank had set a floor price at Rs 351.36 per share for the offering. The issue opened on August 10 and closed on August 14.
Following the allotment of shares, the paid-up equity share capital of the bank has increased to Rs 13,790,821,242 consisting of 6,895,410,621 equity shares of face value Rs 2 each from Rs 12,952,832,416 consisting of 6,476,416,208 equity shares of face value Rs 2 each, ICICI Bank said.

During the share sale, the Monetary Authority of Singapore picked up 4.6 crore shares, representing 11.06 per cent of the QIP size. Other prominent investors included Morgan Stanley Global Opportunity Fund and Societe Generale-ODI, picking up 7.31 per cent and 5.55 per cent, respectively.
The equity issuance also witnessed healthy participation from global and domestic investors, including foreign portfolio investors, domestic mutual funds and insurance companies, the lender said.
With the latest fund raise, ICICI Bank has joined a group of lenders, including the nation’s largest housing finance company HDFC, which raised more than Rs 14,000 crore last week. Others like Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have also raised capital as the system braces for a loan impairment impact because of the Covid-19 crisis. 
It is feared that the banking system could see a rise in bad loans during the second half of this fiscal as the relaxations given by the Reserve Bank of India come to an end.
The central bank has also been asking lenders to beef up their capital in advance, expecting a rise in NPAs.
ICICI Bank said that it is well-positioned to serve the market and benefit from the opportunities that would arise going forward. In these extraordinary times of the coronavirus pandemic, the bank will continue to strive to serve its customers and also emerge stronger as an institution, it added.",business
Not liable to pay Reliance Communications dues: Jio," Reliance Jio’s four-year-old telecom spectrum sharing deal with Reliance Communications (R-Com) is not connected to the latter’s past statutory dues that pertain to the period prior to 2016 when Jio wasn’t even in operation, sources close to the company said. 
A Supreme Court bench had on Friday sought to know why Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) must not pay the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of R-Com as it has been using the latter’s spectrum since 2016. 
A source, refusing to be quoted as the matter is sub-judice, said RJIL in April 2016 entered into a pact to share a part of the spectrum held by R-Com and its unit Reliance Telecom. 
The shared spectrum was limited to the 800MHz band and was strictly in accordance with the department of telecom’s (DoT) spectrum sharing guidelines. R-Com’s 2G, 3G and 4G spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band are not being shared. 
The AGR dues of R-Com and RTL are in no manner connected with this shared spectrum, the source said, adding that the AGR has been paid by both R-Com/RTL and RJIL on the revenue generated from the shared spectrum.

Jaguar Land Rover bailout talks with UK government fails," Bailout talks between Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel with the UK government have ended, leaving both firms to rely on private financing to overcome the impact of coronavirus on business, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
The report here said that talks for an emergency funding fell through as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) did not qualify for taxpayer support. It is the luxury car unit of India’s Tata Motors and Tata Steel, both owned by Indian conglomerate Tata Group.
The bailout plan, titled “Project Birch”, had been authorised by finance minister Rishi Sunak in May to rescue companies that are seen as strategically important, with the Treasury saying it may step in to support crucial businesses on a “last resort” basis after other options run out.
The report, citing a source familiar with the matter, said that the funding scheme became infeasible for Tata as it imposed strict conditions on any lending.
“Tata Steel remains in ongoing and constructive talks with the UK government on areas of potential support,” Tata Steel said in an emailed statement.

The UK Treasury said it would not comment on individual companies. Tata Motors did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Ongoing trade conflicts and Covid-19 has adversely impacted JLR vehicle sales in 2019-20, which contracted by 12 per cent year-on-year. 
A significant part of the volume decline occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019-20. 
JLR was able to improve its profitability during the year and reduce its cash outflows, compared with previous years despite a decrease in volumes through a host of structural initiatives to drive efficiencies. ",business
Top taxmen can order raids," Only the director-general of income tax (investigation) and the chief commissioner for income tax (TDS) can approve I-T raids and all communications from the department to the taxpayer, assessee and any third party will be in the name of the National e-Assessment Center (NeAC).
In an order, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has said the officers posted in directorates of investigation and commissionerates of TDS, “only and exclusively” shall act as “income tax authority” for raids under section 133A of the Income Tax Act.
“The competent authority for approval of such survey action u/s 133A of the Act shall henceforth be DGIT (Inv) for investigation wing and Pr. CCIT/CCIT (TDS) for TDS charges, as the case may be,” said the order.
Noted tax expert Narayan Jain said: “The decision of the CBDT in taking away powers of survey for jurisdictional officers, the joint CITs and CITs is a step in the right direction. 
“In many cases, they used to conduct survey and obtain confession under pressure to meet collection targets. The survey powers of the investigating wing should be used sparingly and they must act in a fair manner. The TDS authorities have limited powers of survey and they should act within that. The TDS official cannot impound books of account or computer records.”

Under section 133A of the Income Tax Act, an income-tax officer or any authorised inspector of income tax can enter any place within the limits of the area assigned to him, or any place occupied by a person who falls under an officer’s jurisdiction or at a location where business or profession is carried on, for tax surveys and raids. 
The officer concerned may also inspect books of account or other documents as he may require and which may be available at such a place.
The issue of alleged tax harassment by officers gained much attention after V.G. Siddharta, the founder of Cafe Coffee Day, committed suicide and left behind a note accusing tax authorities of persecuting him.
The income tax department has embarked on the journey of faceless tax administration. Further, the CBDT has notified the National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC) in Delhi and various Regional e-Assessment Centres (ReACs) across 20 cities in the country for implementation of the scheme.
The CBDT has now given the detailed guidelines for the implementation of the scheme and role of residual charges.
Shailesh Kumar, partner, Nangia & Co LLP, said: “This detailed internal guidance note by the CBDT has clarified that apart from assessment proceedings, a large number of other functions such as rectification proceedings, demand collection management, tax recovery proceedings, proceedings to give effect to appellate orders, etc. shall remain with the field officers.” ",business

Auditor to GVK Power offers to quit," Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP wants to resign as the statutory auditors of GVK Power as it says the group is not providing them with the necessary information for audit of the financial statements for 2019-20.

India returns to $4.83bn trade deficit in July," The country returned to a trade deficit of $4.83 billion in July, a month after a rare trade surplus in over 18 years, as imports increased, showing signs of a pick-up in business activity.
Exports, contracting for the fifth straight month, slipped 10.21 per cent to $23.64 billion in July, on account of decline in the shipments of petroleum, leather and gems and jewellery items, according to government data released on Friday.
The country’s imports, too, dipped 28.4 per cent to $28.47 billion in July, leaving a trade deficit of $4.83 billion compared with a shortfall of $13.43 billion a year ago.
The outward shipments in July, however, recovered from a steeper decline of 60.28 per cent in April, 36.47 per cent in May, and 12.41 per cent in June.
Fieo president Sharad Kumar Saraf said, “All this has been possible because of the start of business activities across the country and enquiries from almost all major economies which has helped to bring exports to almost 90 per cent of the July 2019 level.” The wholesale price-based inflation continued to remain in the negative zone for the fourth straight month at 0.58 per cent even as the prices of vegetables and other food items were costlier.
WPI inflation in June was (-) 1.81 per cent, while for the month of May and April it was (-) 3.37 per cent and (-) 1.57 per cent, respectively. Retail inflation, however, rose to 6.93 per cent in July from 6.23 per cent in the preceding month.
""The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI (Wholesale Price Index), stood at (- 0.58 per cent) (provisional) for the month of July, 2020 as compared to 1.17 per cent during the corresponding month of the previous year,"" the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement.
In contrast, the data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday showed that retail inflation accelerated to 6.93% in July from 6.23% in the preceding month, with food inflation rising to 9.62% from the June level of 8.72%.
Saraf, however, said the global revival and business sentiments still have not picked up, impacting the global supply chain. The government focus should be on FTAs and more of multilateral agreements to further revive our exports and take up competition coming from smaller countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and Taiwan.
Aditi Nayar, principal economist with ICRA said “the rare trade surplus seen in June 2020 predictability vanished with some recovery in merchandise imports in July 2020, which stamped out the further improvement in merchandise exports. This trend is likely to strengthen in the coming months, as demand for non-oil non-gold imports starts to normalise, gold imports gather steam around the festive/marriage months, and crude oil demand and prices stabilise at a moderate level.”
“Merchandise imports had lagged the extent of recovery shown by many high frequency indicators in Q1 FY2021. With the imports of some diverse categories of goods recovering in July 2020 relative to the previous month, such as petroleum products, gold, project goods, electronic goods etc., domestic demand appears to be emanating from the lockdown-induced torpor,” she added.
EEPC India chairman Mahesh Desai said “engineering exports are amongst a handful of sectors which managed to post a positive trend of 8.6 percent growth as global demand for essential metals and other related items have started to bounce back. However, with resurgence of cases in several parts of the world, it would be difficult to say whether the positive trend can be sustained going forward.
“
The oil imports declined by 31.97 per cent to $ 6.53 billion in the month under review and gold imports grew by 4.17 per cent to $1.8 billion.
During the April-July period, exports declined by 30.21 per cent to $74.96 billion, while imports fell 46.7 per cent to $ 88.91 billion. Trade deficit during the period stood at $13.95 billion.
New Delhi: The wholesale price-based inflation continued to remain in the negative zone for the fourth straight month at 0.58 percent even as the prices of vegetables and other food items were costlier.
WPI inflation in June was (-) 1.81 per cent, while for the month of May and April it was (-) 3.37 per cent and (-) 1.57 per cent respectively.
""The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI (Wholesale Price Index), stood at (- 0.58 per cent) (provisional) for the month of July, 2020 as compared to 1.17 per cent during the corresponding month of the previous year,"" the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement.
In contrast, the data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday showed that retail inflation accelerated to 6.93% in July from 6.23% in the preceding month, with food inflation rising to 9.62% from the June level of 8.72%.
Inflation in food articles was at a four-month high level of 4.08 per cent in July, mainly due to sharp rise in vegetable prices. Inflation in vegetables stood at 8.20 per cent, against (-) 9.21 per cent in June.
Pulses saw inflation of 10.24 per cent, while for potatoes it was 69.07 per cent in July. Protein rich items like egg, meat and fish saw hardening of prices with inflation at 5.27 per cent. However, onion prices softened and inflation fell 25.56 per cent, while in fruits it was (-) 3.03 per cent.
Inflation in the fuel and power basket fell 9.84 per cent in July, compared to 13.60 per cent drop in the previous month. Manufactured products, however, witnessed inflation of 0.51 per cent in July, against 0.08 per cent in June.
Analysts said the difference in weightage assigned to different goods/items that make up the two baskets.
In CPI, food has a much higher weightage than in the wholesale basket. So, a rise in food prices will cause a bigger spike in the CPI basket than in the WPI one. Similarly, manufactured goods are given more weightage in the wholesale basket. Therefore, any movement in the price of such items will move the WPI more than it does the CPI. While WPI does not include services, the retail price index does, which impacts final numbers.
Madan Sabnavis, chief economist with Care Ratings said weightage assigned to different components is one of the factors behind the varying trend between WPI and CPI. Another is that retail inflation takes into account services, which has gone up sharply and pushes up the CPI numbers. Retail margins higher for food due to more intermediaries.
“One of the key reasons for subdued wholesale inflation is the depressed prices of manufactured items. Manufactured items have 64.2 % weight in the wholesale price index. The average inflation witnessed in the manufactured items during the past twelve months is -0.1% due to the weak demand conditions in the economy,” Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings said.
He said “the wholesale and retail inflation though paint a contrasting picture and policy prescription, the nominal anchor for RBI is retail inflation.
The retail inflation in combination with recent industrial production data makes the emerging scenario even more complex due to the divergence in trend.
While the industrial production data may support further easing of policy rate, retail inflation breaching RBI’s upper band of 6% in seven out of the last eight months may suggest otherwise. Ind-Ra believes RBI will watch inflation trajectory very carefully and in the interim would continue with the accommodative policy stance but pause on further rate cuts.”
The RBI in its policy review last week kept interest rates unchanged and said it sees an upside risk to inflation. The apex bank projected retail inflation to moderate in October-March period.",business
Flipkart to deliver alcohol in Bengal and Odisha," Walmart-owned Flipkart has teamed up with Diageo-backed HipBar to deliver alcohol in Bengal and Odisha. The development comes after Flipkart’s rival Amazon had in June received approval to deliver liquor in Bengal. 
Flipkart and Amazon’s interest in delivering alcohol in India marks a bold move to make inroads into an alcohol market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
The local governments of Bengal and Odisha have said that Flipkart can be associated as a technology service provider of Diageo-backed HipBar, an Indian alcohol home delivery mobile application.
Flipkart’s customers will  have access to HipBar’s application. HipBar will then deliver the order after collecting the products from retail outlets. Amazon.com on Friday launched an online pharmacy in Bangalore. The service, Amazon Pharmacy, has begun and will soon offer deliveries across the city, Amazon said. It offers both over-the-counter and prescription-based drugs. ",business
Wider radar to stop tax dodge," In a move to widen the tax base and plug evasion, the government plans to bring transactions such as hotel bills over Rs 20,000, education fee of over Rs 1 lakh and purchase of jewellery, white goods, marble or painting over Rs 1 lakh under the scanner of the income tax department.
The government has proposed to expand the list of reported transactions to include domestic business class air travel or foreign travel, cash deposit of Rs 10 lakh or more in non-current accounts, sale of foreign exchange above Rs 10 lakh, payment of property tax above Rs 20,000 per year, life insurance premium above Rs 50,000 and health insurance premium above Rs 20,000, mygov.in said in a tweet on Thursday which has been subsequently removed.
As part of the multiple reforms to improve tax compliance, faceless assessment and the ease of filing returns, the government has proposed to reduce the threshold of various transactions for tax disclosure.
Tax experts said to bring more transactions under the scanner would require an amendment of the Income Tax Act. Section 285A is an enabling section, which empowers the CBDT to prescribe various transactions for reporting to the I-T department.
Noted tax advocate Narayan Jain said, “This has been done with the objective of widening the tax base but monetary limits need to be revisited and should be reasonably increased so that compliance becomes easier. In the case of financial transactions or payments above Rs 50,000 and up to Rs 2 lakh, furnishing of PAN should be enough.”
“Taxpayers claim deduction for medical insurance  and life insurance premium. So, it may be illusory to cover the same for the purpose of reporting or for mentioning in Form 26AS. Again, in most of the cases, the property tax paid is  claimed as deduction for computing income from house property. The taxpayer charter assured of minimising compliance cost but these reporting measures are likely to substantially increase the compliance cost,” he added.
The government has also proposed to deduct TDS at higher rates for those who do not file income tax returns. There is also a proposal for compulsory filing of ITR by those having bank transactions above Rs 30 lakh, all professionals and businesses having turnover of more than Rs 50 lakh and payment of rent above Rs 40,000.
More transactional categories in the reporting imply an enhanced flow of information to tax authorities, but will put the onus on taxpayers to comply voluntarily. When implemented, it will also be reflected in Form 26AS, the consolidated annual statement showing tax deductions/ collections and advance tax against an individual’s PAN.",business
DoT claims on Reliance Communications contested," State Bank of India, the lead banker of the committee of creditors which is overseeing the bankruptcy resolution process at Reliance Communications (R-Com), has virtually tried to repudiate the Centre’s claim to roughly Rs 25,000 crore worth of unpaid telecom licence fee dues of the former Anil Ambani-owned company.
Creditor banks had steered R-Com into the insolvency process in May 2019, ostensibly giving it a cloak of protection against operational creditors, including the department of telecom (DoT).
The DoT has been pressing hard to realise Rs 1.47 lakh crore in pending telecom dues from 15 mobile telephony licence holders, many of whom have already hit the wall and no longer offer services.
On Friday, Harish Salve, lead counsel for R-Com’s committee of creditors, argued that the telecom company’s financial creditors like the banks and financial institutions had the first claim to any payout by the telecom company under the terms of the insolvency process. Operational creditors like DoT would simply have to wait.
Salve told the court that the CoC had “complete autonomy to decide who gets how much”. In several IBC cases, operational creditors have received next to nothing as the financial creditors pounced on the assets of the bankrupt firms.
“Operational creditors (like DoT) cannot be paid on a par with the financial creditors,” Salve told the court during the hearing.
Salve went on to add that SBI believed that the spectrum that had been leased to R-Com for 20 years had to be treated as an asset of the telecom companies — a line of argument that the Centre has consistently challenged on the grounds of Constitutional privileges that confer rights to all resources in the country, including radio waves on the sovereign.
The R-Com spectrum has been farmed out to Reliance Jio under a spectrum sharing deal in 2016.
The apex court bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, S. Abdul Nazeer and M.R. Shah wanted to know the details of the spectrum sharing pact and asked why Jio could not be asked to pay the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) related telecom dues on behalf of R-Com.
“Jio needs to explain why we should not catch hold of you to pay the AGR dues. By sharing R-Com revenue, you (Jio) have gained revenue... this is revenue sharing. 
If Jio is using public assets like spectrum, why should Jio not be liable to pay the AGR dues.” 
“We want details of spectrum sharing agreements entered into by all insolvent companies. We want to know who is using the spectrum of the insolvent companies,” the bench said while adjourning the matter till August 17 (Monday).
The bench asked the DoT to submit the documents certifying all spectrum sharing arrangements.
Senior advocate Shyam Divan, who appeared for the resolution professional appointed to look after the day-to-day affairs at R-Com, said the government had been informed about the spectrum sharing agreement in 2016 and relevant fees paid.
“When the sovereign right is transferred to the telco for using spectrum, can the dues arising become subservient to the dues claimed by secured creditors?” Justice Mishra observed. 
“There is a need to ensure that the IBC is not misused by companies to escape liabilities,” the bench said.
We can lay down the law if required for the IBC process. Dues arising out of the use of natural, public resources cannot be (treated as) merely operational dues, a matter of public money,” Justice Mishra observed.
On July 2, the apex court had agreed to consider a staggered payment schedule for the long-pending AGR dues of the telecom companies. But before it passed its verdict, the court had sought clarity on the insolvency claims made by R-COm, Videcom and Shyam Sistema Teleservices.
The court wanted the other insolvent telecom companies like Aircel and Shyam Sistema to also come out with details of their spectrum sharing agreements, if any, with other players.",business
System of faceless tax appeals will come into force from Sept 25," Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a transparent tax platform and said the system of faceless tax appeals would come into force from September 25. 
Modi also rolled out a taxpayers’ charter, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the tax officers and taxpayers. Analysts said the charter had laid out the principles only and must be supplemented by administrative orders.
The Centre has been pushing for a system to break down the interface between the tax officials and taxpayers. It has already started the system of faceless tax scrutiny — and the latest measures mark a step forward.
Mukesh Butani, managing partner at BMR Legal Advocates, said, “The tax statutes need an amendment to curtail the discretionary powers of the field officials because that has predominantly contributed to the current situation. The faceless assessment and appeal scheme shall act as a restriction on individual discretion, which in my view has caused the most damage with regard to harassment.”
The issue of alleged tax harassment by officers gained much attention after V.G. Siddharta, the founder of Cafe Coffee Day, committed suicide and left behind a note accusing the tax authorities of persecuting him.
Under the faceless appeal  system, the appeals will be randomly allotted to any officer in the country. The identification of the officers deciding the appeal will remain unknown, and  the taxpayer will not be required to visit the income tax office or the officer. The appellate decision will be team-based and reviewed.
The exceptions to the  system include serious frauds, major tax evasion, sensitive and search matters. The system also excludes international taxation and the Black Money Act and the Benami Property Transactions Act.
Noted tax advocate Narayan Jain said “faceless assessments and appeals will remove the necessity of the personal appearance of taxpayers or their representatives. However, officials need to be fair and objective and decide the matters judiciously”.
Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader at EY India, said, “As an immediate relief, it would be highly desirable if the CBDT instructs the release of all pending refunds to companies as quite a few companies are left with no choice but to consider approaching courts to expedite their refunds in this pandemic-induced stressful business environment.”
The income tax department has issued refunds worth Rs 71,229 crore in over 21.24 lakh cases till July 11, the finance ministry has said.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued income tax refunds of Rs 24,603 crore in 19.79 lakh cases to individual taxpayers and corporate tax refunds of Rs 46,626 crore in 1.45 lakh cases to companies and all refund-related cleaning up of tax demands is being taken up on priority and is likely to be completed by August 31, the finance ministry has said. .
Through the charter document, the government has committed the following to the taxpayers: To provide fair, courteous and reasonable treatment; Treat taxpayer as honest; To provide mechanism for appeal and review; To provide complete and accurate information; To provide timely decisions; To collect the correct amount of tax; To respect privacy of taxpayers; To maintain confidentiality; To hold its authorities accountable; To enable representative of choice; To provide mechanism to lodge complaint; To provide a fair and just system; To publish service standards and report periodically; and  To reduce cost of compliance.
The taxpayer charter also highlights the obligations of the taxpayer like To be honest and compliant; To be informed; To keep accurate records; To know what your representative does on your behalf; To respond in time; and To pay in time.
“The rights provided to the taxpayers through this charter intends to bring more clarity and provide good practices to the administration against providing stringent requirements in the income tax legislation with detailed mechanisms and processes to deal with breach of legal right. It may nevertheless be possible for taxpayers to seek its implementation contending that it ought to be binding on the administrating officers,” Kumarmanglam Vijay, partner, J. Sagar Associates, said.
 Shailesh Kumar, Partner, Nangia & Co LLP said “the Taxpayer's Charter in its present form intends to bring qualitative change in the way Income Tax department functions and two administrative orders limiting interaction between tax officials and taxpayers has been issued immediately after release of Taxpayer's Charter. We can see similar administrative orders in coming days to further streamline the processes and to improve taxpayers' experience with the income tax department. The same may include fixing timelines on completion of proceedings, processing various applications filed by taxpayers, issuance of refunds in addition to timelines already prescribed in the Income tax act. Presently, the Taxpayer's Charter is more on principle and setting the overall theme, which will be supplemented by administrative orders to be issued by the CBDT in times to come,” he added.
Jain also said that under section 115BBE, aggregate tax is as much as 78 per cent from assessment year 2017-18. During demonetisation in December 2016 the rate was increased from 30 per cent to 75 per cent plus education cess. He demanded that the rate should be brought back to 30 per cent. The tax rates and Tax laws have to be fair and reasonable to ensure proper tax compliance, added Jain.",business
Retail inflation simmers at 6.93%," India’s retail inflation rose to 6.93 per cent  in July on higher food prices, remaining above the RBI’s medium-term target for the 10th straight month, according to government data released on Thursday.
July’s figure was higher than the 6.23 per cent recorded in June.
Food prices soared because of supply-side disruptions caused by the coronavirus lockdown. They rose 9.62 per cent compared with a jump of 8.72  per cent in June.
The steady rise in coronavirus cases has disrupted the supply chain as lockdowns continue at regional levels.
Fearing a sharp rise in inflation, the RBI last week kept interest rates on hold, after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February. The RBI has set its medium term inflation target at 4 per cent.
The economy is expected to contract more than 4.5 per cent in the current fiscal year, but some analysts do not expect the central bank to cut rates further this year.
“Given the distortions in supply chains and transportation, I don’t expect a rate cut in the remaining part of 2020,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, economist at L&T Financial Holdings.
M. Govinda Rao, chief economic adviser of Brickwork Ratings, said: “CPI inflation rose in July despite fewer supply-side constraints following the relaxation of lockdown. We expect food inflation to soften in the coming months with easing supply constraints and better monsoon so far. However, the core inflation may remain at elevated levels as the demand picks up, but capacity utilisation does not increase.”
Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, India Ratings said: “MPC will watch inflation trajectory very carefully before taking decisions on rate cuts.”
“The evolving trends suggest that the CPI inflation may remain appreciably above 6 per cent in August 2020, which would be the last inflation print available before the next MPC review. Accordingly, the likelihood that the MPC would persist with a pause in its October 2020 meeting has climbed sharply, with a final rate cut likely to be deferred to the December 2020 or February 2021 meeting,” Aditi Nayar, principal economist of ICRA, said.
Monsoon rains are expected to be 104 per cent of the long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate some of the damage caused by the pandemic.
However, hopes rest on the monsoon spread which are expected to be 104 per cent of a long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate some of the economic damage caused by the pandemic.
The government suspended the release of CPI inflation headline numbers for April and May due to insufficient data during the lockdown.
The RBI kept interest rates on hold last week after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February - despite a recent rise in retail consumer prices - but said it would ensure inflation remains within target.
It is for the second consecutive month that the retail inflation has been above the RBI's comfort level. The government has mandated the central bank to restrict the inflation at 4 percent (+, - 2 per cent). The central bank mainly factors in retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy.",business
H-1B visa: exemptions to ease travel restrictions," The US state department on Wednesday released a set of exemptions that will ease travel restrictions that were clamped on H-1B visa holders in June though there were some lingering concerns over certain caveats in the guidance note.
In a proclamation issued two months ago, President Donald Trump suspended work visas across H-1B, L and J categories, sparking concern in the country’s technology industry.
The latest guidance note says healthcare professionals and researchers travelling on a request supported by a US government agency or an entity to meet critical US foreign policy objectives will be allowed to travel to the US on these visas.
The government has also allowed travel by applicants seeking to resume ongoing employment in the United States in the same position with the same employer and visa classification.
Travel by technical specialists, senior-level managers and other workers whose travel is necessary to facilitate the economic recovery of the United States has also been permitted.
Industry body Nasscom said it was cautiously optimistic about the exemptions but added that the guidelines still allow a lot of leeway in its interpretation. “The exceptions include potential exemptions for technology workers on H-1B/L-1 visas providing critical infrastructure services, a key ask by Nasscom and the Indian tech industry,” Nasscom said in a statement on Thursday.
The association noted that it also includes exceptions for H-1B/L-1 visa-holders who would be returning to the US in the same position with the same employer and visa classification.
Nasscom said it has consistently raised the importance of visa holders working in the tech sector, particularly those who would be delivering services designated essential as per the DHS CISA ‘Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce’.
It raised the importance of particularly those who would be returning to the US in the same position with the same employer and visa classification.
Nasscom welcomed the move saying this will help US businesses access talent critical to the economic recovery phase in the post-COVID world.
“However, we remain ‘cautiously optimistic’ as caveats in the DoS guidance about seniority, unique and significant contributions and/or other factors that go along with the exceptions still allow a lot of leeway in interpretation of the new guidance. The impact can only be gauged in course of time,” it added.
Nasscom emphasised that this is a step in the right direction and encouraged the implementing agencies to ensure that American businesses’ access to critical talent is not hampered.
US President Donald Trump, in his June proclamation, had banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including the H-1B, arguing that they eat into American jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.",business
Royal Dutch Shell ready to board Nayara," Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy has received a major boost in its petrochemical plans with Royal Dutch Shell likely to buy a 50 per cent stake in the proposed project.
Nayara, formerly Essar Oil, operates a 20-million-tonne refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat apart from a network of 5,700 retail fuel outlets.
In January 2019, the company had announced that it is working on a milestone development programme for its Vadinar refinery and that the first stage involves a foray into the Indian petrochemical market.
It had then disclosed that the first phase of the programme includes construction of units to provide for production of up to 450,000 tonnes of polypropylene per annum. The project is to be completed in 2022.
The preliminary cumulative investments for the first phase was put at $850 million. Nayara had then said that the programme will be funded through internal accruals and bank financing.
Subsequently, there were reports that it was looking to expand the capacity of the Vadinar refinery and set up a petrochemical complex with a capacity of around 10.75 lakh tonnes.
On Wednesday, Reuters had reported that Royal Dutch Shell is planning to buy a 50 per cent stake in the proposed petrochemical project of Nayara. Quoting sources, the report said that the petrochemical joint venture between the two entities was discussed at the meeting of the board of directors of Nayara in November and December last year.
The entire project, which will be completed in five years, will have a 1.8-million-tonne ethylene cracker and linked downstream units and the total cost would be around $9 billion.
At present, Nayara owns and operates India’s second largest single site refinery at Vadinar. The refinery has a Nelson complexity of 11.8, which is among the highest globally which enables it to process the toughest of the crudes.
Observers said that the interest shown by Shell in Nayara’s petrochemical complex reflects the potential of the Indian market and bodes well for domestic giant Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
RIL has been betting aggressively on petrochemicals. In November last year, it confirmed plans to invest Rs 70,000 crore to establish a crude oil-to-chemicals complex at the company’s Jamnagar facility. It also commissioned a refinery off-gas cracker in January 2019 at the same site with 1.5-million-tonnes ethylene capacity.
Though the industry is now facing challenging conditions amid the Covid-19 pandemic, analysts do not expect the present situation to last longer.

Titagarh Wagons in private train bid," Titagarh Wagons is open to opportunities to diversify which are emerging from Indian Railways’ move to invite private players to operate passenger train services.
The city-based rolling stock maker plans to keep its options open both as a supplier of rolling stock as well as explore strategic alliances to expand business in the services space as an operator.
According to Umesh Chowdhary, vice-chairman and managing director of Titagarh Wagons, the decision of the railways to invite private operators and improve the services in the passenger segment is a move that was long overdue as the freight sector already has seen private participation.
“Globally, we have seen that railways provide infrastructure and trains are operated by different players. This decision of Indian Railways will revolutionise the passenger movement,” Chowdhary told The Telegraph. He added that private operators will bring in competition and efficiency and further improve the passenger experience.
“At present, we are primarily a rolling stock manufacturer. It is an opportunity for us in many ways — whether as an operator or as a rolling stock manufacturer. It is too early to predict how this will take shape, but we are keeping our options open,” said Chowdhary.
Titagarh Wagons is among the 23 companies that have expressed interest in operating private trains as a service provider. Alstom, BEML, Bharat Forge, Bhel, Bombardier and  GMR are among the other operators who have shown interest.
Railways in July had said that it is seeking private participation in operation of passenger train services in over 109 origin-destination pairs of routes through introduction of 151 modern rakes that will be in addition to the existing trains operated on the network. A first of its kind initiative, the project is estimated to attract a private sector investment of about Rs 30,000 crore. Tenders are expected to be finalised by March 2021 and trains are expected to operate from March 2023, Railways had said in a statement.
The private operators have to pay a haulage charge for using railway infrastructure and there are likely to be penalties for delay.",business
Limit on core investment companies," The RBI on Thursday tightened its rules on core investment companies (CICs) when it curtailed the number of layers of such entities in a group and directed them to make more disclosures. The RBI accepted the proposals of a panel under former corporate affairs secretary Tapan Ray, which had submitted its report in November 2018.
A CIC is a non-banking finance company (NBFC) which carries on the business of the acquisition of shares and securities and holds not less than 90 per cent of its net assets in the form of investment in equity shares, preference shares, bonds, debentures, debt or loans in group companies.
The Tapan Ray-panel had observed that the Companies’ Act 2013 restricted the group structure to a maximum of three layers, with one CIC at the top which could hold investments in step-down entities. However, NBFCs were exempted from this provision, which facilitated the proliferation of multiple layers of CICs in a group with cross-holdings.
The RBI said the number of layers of CICs in a group should now be restricted to two, irrespective of the extent of direct or indirect holding or control exercised by a CIC in the other CIC.
The RBI also strengthened the risk management at CICs as it looked to curb excessive leveraging.
It said parent CIC in the group or CIC with the largest asset size, if there is no identifiable parent CIC in the group, will form a Group Risk Management Committee.
The RBI added that if a CIC makes any direct or indirect equity investment in another CIC, it will be deemed as a layer for the investing CIC.
In cases where there are more than two layers in a group, the apex bank said that they will have time till March 2023 to reorganise their business structure and adhere to this guideline.

Tata Steel deep in red," Tata Steel on Thursday reported a sharply higher loss than anticipated by analysts for the quarter ended June 30 as the Covid-19 pandemic hit demand. The steel major posted a consolidated loss of Rs 4,609 crore compared with a net profit of Rs 695 crore in the same period of the previous year.
Analysts were expecting Tata Steel to post a net loss of around Rs 2,400 crore.
The loss came as total revenues slid to Rs 24,288.51 crore from Rs 35,947.11 crore in the year-ago period.
The effect of coronavirus and the resulting global lockdown was reflected in its operations with production falling to 4.93 million tonnes from 6.34 million tonnes in the same period of the previous year.
Tata Steel disclosed that the average steel realisations in India were lower because of the Covid-19 impact during the quarter and about Rs 2,000 crore of costs were under-absorbed because of the lower volumes.
The performance of Tata Steel Europe was also affected because of the overall weakness in economic activities in Europe and a sharp drop in spreads. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) on Thursday reported nearly doubling of net profit in the June quarter after inventory gains offset a decline in refining margins and fuel sales.
The standalone net profit in April-June stood at Rs 2,076.17 crore compared with Rs 1,075.12 crore a year back.
The company earned $0.39 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel compared with a gross refining margin $2.81 a barrel a year ago in the same period of the previous year.
Fuel sales in the quarter that saw economic activity coming to a halt due to nationwide COVID-19 lockdown slipped to 7.53 million tonnes when compared to 11.11 million tonnes sales last year.
The company disclosed that to preserve cash flows and focus on disciplined capital allocation, it has curtailed growth capex for this year and the focus is primarily on safety environment and sustenance capital expenditure.
“During the quarter, we re-calibrated our operations and our sales across geographies in line with underlying regulatory and market conditions..Economic activity is gradually recovering. In India, we have ramped-up our capacity utilizations to 90 per cent levels with total sales in June exceeding 2019-20 average monthly sales. We are further ramping up capacity utilization and increasing domestic sales which will lead to an improvement in our margins in coming quarters’’, V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director, Tata Steel said.
Tata Steel disclosed that given the heightened economic uncertainty, it has  ramped up the liquidity buffer to Rs 20,144 crore which will be deployed to deleverage as business conditions normalize.
“Tata Steel responded very swiftly to the pandemic in April and despite the national lock down in India, the company remained focus on its cash flow management to generate a free cash flow quarter and maintained its net debt at the March 2020 level. This was achieved through cross functional co-ordination and cash war room initiatives covering fixed cost reduction, working capital management through better inventory management, focus on debtors, working with suppliers and other initiatives. This enabled the company to generate free cash flow of Rs 700 crore post capex and other obligations’’, Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and CFO, Tata Steel said.",business
MNCs in the fray to run private trains," Multinationals Alstom, Bombardier and Siemens are among the 23 probable bidders to operate private trains in the country.
A pre-bid meeting was held here on Wednesday, which was also attended by Indian companies GMR Infrastructure, Titagarh Wagons, PSUs Bharat Earth Movers Limited and BHEL along with the IRCTC. In the first meeting held on July 21, 16 firms were present.
At the second pre-bid meeting, the companies put forth several queries, including on the eligibility criteria and the bidding process. The bidders also sought clarity on the procurement of trains and their fares. They had queries on operations and maintenance and the timing of trains and halts.
The railways said it has reduced the Request for Qualification (RFQ) fee by one tenth for those entities participating in more than one project. Complete freedom will be given on the procurement of trains even as the restriction of three projects per bidder will be reduced and the leasing of trains will be permitted.
In all, the railways is inviting 12 requests for qualification to operate 151 private trains. The first dozen private trains will roll out in the next two years and all the 151 trains will run by 2026-27. The contract will be for 35 years. The project involves private investment of Rs 30,000 crore.
Analysts said the private train project is expected to boost the revenues of Indian Railways, which has been trying to look at ways to reduce losses. 
The railways recover just 57 per cent of costs through passenger fares, with the rest coming from freight subsidy. 
The railways had earlier said the operators shall have the freedom to decide on fares . 
The private entities will be selected through a two-stage competitive bidding process comprising Request for Qualification (RFQ) and Request for Proposal (RFP). The due date for opening of RFQ is September 8.",business
Coal India wants rail tariff relief," Coal India has urged Indian Railways to offer it a 15 per cent freight concession to transport domestic coal for a distance of 701-1400 kilometres (km) from its mines.  
In June, the Railway Board had decided to grant a 20 per cent concession on freight price for a distance of more than 1400 km on the transportation of coal. 
The concession is on normal tariff rates, provided that after applying the concession, the freight price should not be less than the tariff rate for a distance up to 1400 km. This concession is valid from July 2020 to June 30, 2021.
But Coal India officials on Wednesday said that there was a case for widening the scope of concession as only a handful of consumers in the power sector, which constitutes the bulk of the public sector miner’s offtake, are eligible to get the benefits.
Of the 126 coal-based thermal power plants linked to Coal India, 14 plants located beyond 1400 km are eligible for freight concession at present. 
Moreover, these plants have supply contracts of only 42 million tonnes of coal per annum. Six non-power consumers who would benefit from the present concession  have annual coal contracts of 1.37 mt per annum.
Once the concession is extended, it will boost Coal India’s offtake, which has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, and also encourage import substitution. “Extension of freight concession to customers located in the range of 701-1400 km could result in substantial domestic coal lifted by them in place of coal sourced from abroad due to lesser cost of coal conveyance,” said a senior Coal India executive.

NMDC hikes iron ore price by Rs 300," NMDC, the country’s largest iron ore miner, has hiked the rates of the mineral by Rs 300 to Rs 2,950 a tonne with immediate effect.
Iron ore is the key raw material used in steel making and, therefore, any revision in its prices has a direct impact on the prices of steel.
In a regulatory filing with the stock exchanges, NMDC said it has increased the price of lumps, or high-grade iron ore, by Rs 300 to Rs 2,950 per tonne, and that of iron ore fines, or inferior grade ore, by Rs 300 to Rs 2,660 a tonne.
The revised prices exclude royalty, District Mineral Fund (DMF), National Mineral Exploration Trust (DMET), cess, forest permit fee and other taxes, the company added. 
It disclosed that the new rates are effective from August 12.
The last revision, effective July 31, was announced on August 3, when NMDC had fixed the price of lumps at Rs 2,650 per tonne and of fines at Rs 2,360 a tonne.
NMDC is also involved in the exploration of a wide range of minerals such as copper, rock phosphate, lime stone, dolomite and gypsum.
On the BSE, its shares ended at Rs 94.35, a gain of 1.18 per cent over the last close.
In a recent note, analysts at Motilal Oswal said that the price hikes by the company have been ahead of their estimates and this has been on the back of improving volumes. ",business
Modi to launch taxpayer charter today," Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a platform to honour the country’s honest taxpayers on Thursday. The “taxpayer charter” is expected to have statutory status and will empower citizens by ensuring time-bound services by the income tax department.
The finance minister, the revenue secretary, the CBDT chief and the tax commissioners will be present at the launch.
In the budget for 2020-21, unveiled on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said “we wish to enshrine in the statutes a ‘taxpayer charter’ through this budget. Our government would like to reassure taxpayers that we remain committed to taking measures so that our citizens are free from harassment of any kind”.
She had said any tax system requires trust between taxpayers and the administration, which will be possible only when taxpayers’ rights are clearly enumerated.
The charter will list out the fundamental rights of taxpayers and the basic standards of services that they should expect. The charter will aim to change the relationship between taxpayers and the tax department from being an enforcer to a facilitator. The department, on its part, will be expected to provide services that are fair and efficient.
To provide for resolution of pending tax disputes, the income tax department has also brought out the Direct Tax “Vivad se Vishwas Act, 2020” under which declarations for settling disputes are being filed at present. ",business

German lender Deutsche Bank to bring in Rs 2700cr," German lender Deutsche Bank on Wednesday announced a capital infusion of Rs 2,700 crore into its India operations for expansion across segments. 
This is the second time in less than two years that the bank has infused money into its local operations of 17 branches after bringing in Rs 3,800 crore in early 2019.
A bank statement said the fresh capital will be used to support the expansion of Deutsche Bank India across all of its businesses, including corporate banking, investment banking and international private banking, which have been consistently growing over the years. 
The bank’s chief country officer Kaushik Shaparia said the incremental capital injection should be seen as a strong validation of the lender’s confidence in the business model and potential in India. 
“It also demonstrates our intent to further deepen our presence here,” he said, adding that the recent months have thrown up opportunities to work ever more closely with clients and support them with services and advice in steering through the tough environment. 
The capital adequacy ratio for the bank, which has been present in India since 1980, stood at 14.93 per cent as of March 31, 2020, which will go up after the infusion. 
Total capital deployed by Deutsche Bank in its India branches has now increased to Rs 18,200 crore and the overall assets stood at Rs 1.2 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020, the statement said.  With the Reserve Bank allowing the restructuring of loans that are facing stress because of the Covid-19 pandemic, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are likely to see an increase in their refinancing requirements, says a report. 
Last week, the RBI gave permission to lenders to go for a one-time restructuring of corporate and personal loans facing stress. 
“The RBI’s decision allowing lenders to restructure loans would increase their refinancing requirements, especially for NBFCs,” India Ratings and Research said in a report. 
“This is in view of their large contractual debt repayments, as scheduled cash inflow gets deferred, though the severity of the same would depend upon the proportion of loan portfolio restructured and terms of restructuring (i.e complete moratorium vs partial payments),” it added. ",business
BPCL selloff hurdles," Global energy players are keen to pick up the government’s 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL, given the country’s projected fuel demand over the next few years. However, they are looking at clarity over fuel pricing and other issues and waiting for the travel restrictions to be lifted, analysts said.
After the deadline for the submission of expressions of interest was extended for the third time, concerns have been raised over whether the interest of global investors was waning.
“A combination of global and domestic factors are at play in the context of BPCL’s privatisation. Several global firms have recently announced commitments to reduce fossil fuel production and thereby carbon emissions. The pandemic has also restricted movement of people. Interested bidders would like to site visits and hold in-person meetings with management teams to evaluate such a large transaction,” said Dilip Khanna, partner, strategy and transactions, EY.
K. Ravichandran, senior VP and energy analyst at Icra, said, “Once the pandemic-related restrictions are removed, there would be increased interest in the sector. One of the issues of concern for global investors would be pricing of fuel like petrol and diesel, and they could seek clarity on it.” ",business
"Opec sees steep decline in demand, recovery in 2021 uncertain"," World oil demand will fall more steeply in 2020 than previously forecast because of the coronavirus and there are doubts about next year’s recovery, Opec forecast on Wednesday, potentially making it harder for the group and its allies to support the market.
World oil demand will tumble 9.06 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a monthly report, more than the 8.95 million bpd decline expected a month ago.
Oil prices have collapsed as the coronavirus curtailed travel and economic activity. While some countries have eased lockdowns, allowing demand to recover, fear of new outbreaks has kept a lid on prices and Opec expects this to persist.
“Crude and product price developments in the second half of 2020 will continue to be impacted by concerns over a second wave of infections and higher global stocks,” Opec said in the report.
Opec stuck to its forecast that in 2021 oil demand would rebound by 7 million bpd but said the outlook was subject to large uncertainties that might result in “a negative impact on petroleum consumption” such as demand for air travel, more fuel-efficient cars and more competition from other fuels.
“Almost all forecasters expect jet fuel in 2021 to struggle making up for lost demand,” Opec said. ",business
"Fuel demand slows down in July after picking up pace in May, June"," India’s fuel demand is beginning to flatten after showing signs of returning to life as consumption dipped 11.7 per cent in July, official data showed.
Fuel consumption, a barometer of economic activity in the country, had slumped over 45 per cent in April as the nationwide lockdown halted most vehicular traffic and shut industries. However, with the easing of lockdown restrictions, the demand picked up in May and June with month-on-month increase in consumption numbers. 
However, mini-lockdowns imposed by states to contain the spread of the coronavirus seemed to have stopped this recovery, with demand falling 3.5 per cent in July over the previous month. 
Fuel demand fell to 15.67 million tonnes (mt) in July, 11.7 per cent lower compared with 17.75 mt consumed in the same month a year ago, and 3.5 per cent lower than the June sales of 16.24 mt. 
Consumption of diesel, which accounts for about two-fifth of India’s overall fuel use, fell 19.25 per cent to 5.52mt in July from a year earlier, data released by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of the oil ministry showed.",business
Churn signals Indiabulls bank hope," Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited (IHFL) has appointed former RBI deputy governor Subhash Sheoratan Mundra as its non-executive chairman — a strategic move that many believe signals that the financial services entity has not abandoned its quest for a banking licence after being stonewalled by a vicious campaign last year to undermine its credentials.
Mundra will replace Sameer Gehlaut, the founder of the Indiabulls group, who resigned as the executive chairman of IHFL with immediate effect.
In a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges after market hours, Indiabulls Housing Finance said Gehlaut has been re-designated as the non-executive, non-independent director of the company.
The company said Gehlaut resigned as he wanted to focus more on the group’s financial services firm — Indiabulls Ventures —which is into consumer lending that includes personal loans, asset reconstruction and the capital market business.
Last October, the RBI had rejected a proposal to merge Indiabulls Housing Finance with troubled Tamil Nadu-based  Lakshmi Vilas Bank, following allegations that money worth thousands of crores were siphoned off by Gehlaut and the directors. Subsequently, the petitioner who had approached the Supreme Court alleging the misappropriation of funds withdrew the plea made against Gehlaut.
At a board meeting on Wednesday, Gehlaut informed the board he has taken up the position of chief executive officer of Indiabulls Ventures Ltd. “Gehlaut proposed the name of Mundra for the position of non-executive chairman of the company. The board of directors of the company unanimously agreed with the suggestion made by Gehlaut and appointed Mundra as the non-executive chairman with immediate effect,” the company said.
Gehlaut has been leading the company for over 20 years since its inception in January 2000.
Observers who track IHFL believe there could much more to the appointment of Mundra: the company may still be preparing for a banking licence, albeit at a later date, even as it improves its corporate governance.
Analysts said the appointment of the new chief could see the company taking several steps which include improving its asset quality. After  the IL&FS crisis, players such as Indiabulls Housing Finance have faced difficulties in accessing finance at attractive rates.
Gehlaut’s resignation comes at a time both banks and non-banks are witnessing the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the form of a fall in loan disbursals and a fear of a rise in bad loans once the moratorium given by the RBI ends this month.
Amid such circumstances, analysts say, the presence of a seasoned banker such as Mundra is positive for the company.
Mundra was the RBI deputy governor till July 2017. Earlier, he was the chairman and managing director of Bank of Baroda and executive director of Union Bank of India. 
“The company has taken significant strides over the years under Gehlaut, and the board appreciated his desire to engage in another phase of institution building,” Mundra said after his appointment. 
“Indiabulls Housing has a committed management team, and it has done a good job in navigating the present challenging times. I look forward to now working even more closely with the management team, especially with the confidence that the board and the management is committed to keep striving to deliver strong business growth with high standards of governance backed by strong risk management practices,’’ Mundra said.",business
Railways shell out more in ticket refunds than ever before," Perhaps for the first time in its 167-year-long history, the Railways has refunded more than it has earned from ticket bookings, registering a negative passenger segment revenue of Rs 1,066 crore in the Covic-19-hit first quarter of 2020-21, an RTI query by a Madhya Pradesh-based activist has found.
The freight earnings, however, during the period managed to hold ground, according to the RTI reply provided to Chandra Shekhar Gaur.
The revenue in the first three months of this financial year, when the Railways had to suspend all its regular passenger services due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, was in the negative -- Rs 531.12 crore in April, Rs 145.24 crore in May and Rs 390.6 in June (all in negative), the RTI reply said.
""The minus figures are being shown due to the fact that the value of refunds is more than the value of tickets booked"", said Railway spokesperson DJ Narain.
An official explained that due to the suspension of services, tickets booked for travel in April, May and June were offered refunds, while fewer tickets were booked during these three months due to the restrictions.

The Railways has cancelled all regular passenger services indefinitely.
In the first quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal, the Railways had earned Rs 4,345 crore in April, Rs 4,463 crore in May and Rs 4,589 crore in June.
The Railways has said that due to the pandemic, it is envisaging a loss of around Rs 40,000 crore this financial year.
However, freight traffic seems to have recovered somewhat since the Railways has been the preferred mode of transportation for ferrying essential during these months.
In April 2020, the freight earning was Rs 5,744 crore, in May it was 7,289 crore and in June the number stood at Rs 8,706 crore.
In the first quarter of last fiscal year, it earned Rs 9,331 crore in April, Rs 10,032 crore in May and Rs 9,702 crore in June.
Narain said the Railways' freight operations during the last two weeks are higher than the last year's corresponding figures for the same period, adding that it is a very encouraging and positive sign.
A concerted effort by railway officials and better management practices will ensure that revenue lost in the passenger segment is significantly offset by an outstanding freight performance, Narain said.
The Railways said that it has also suffered losses to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in the running of the Shramik Special trains which began operations from May 1 to ferry stranded migrant workers home.

Aramco revives Reliance Industries interest," Saudi Aramco has indicated that it is doing a due diligence on picking up a stake in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business of Reliance Industries, which raises the prospects of some movement in the proposed $15-billion transaction.
However, at a conference call with investors after it announced its results for the half- year ended June 30, Amin H. Nasser, CEO, president and director of Aramco, did not indicate any timeline for the closure of the transaction as he refrained from giving any further details.
This is the first official comment coming from the top brass of the oil giant in several months.
“With regard to the Reliance deal, all I can say at this stage, it’s going through the due diligence. So depending on it, we will make our decision. This is a big deal. So we need to take our time to review and then decide based on the outcome of the study,’’ Nasser said when asked for an update on the progress of the  deal.
Addressing shareholders at its annual general meeting last month, RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani had said that the proposed transaction is not proceeding for now.

“Due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the Covid-19 situation, the (Aramco) deal has not progressed according to the original timeline,’’ Ambani said.
The deal was initially announced by the RIL chief at a shareholders meeting in 2019 where he had disclosed that Aramco would pay $15 billion for a 20 per cent stake in its O2C business.
While RIL is spinning off its O2C business into a separate subsidiary, analysts are of the view that Reliance will have to settle for a much lower valuation. It is not immediately clear if Nasser’s latest comments would lead to Reliance accepting a lesser valuation.",business
Government e-Marketplace sees potential of $100 billion of transactions," The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) platform sees a potential of $100 billion of transactions as it gears up for an upgrade in September.
The online platform, which turned four years on August 9, has registered a transaction value worth Rs 58,578 crore with 441,043 sellers and service providers on board.
GeM CEO Talleen Kumar said on Tuesday that a unified procurement system is being planned that consolidates all public procurement platforms allowing vendors to onboard on one platform. The consolidation will lead to better economies of scale, dissemination of best practices and efficient price discovery.
“The products and services amenable to procurement in a marketplace is about 5 per cent of the GDP. In India this translates roughly to Rs 5-8 lakh crore per annum. If we consider Rs 7 lakh crore per annum it translates to $100 billion. Our aim is to get as close to $100 billion per annum as possible,” Kumar said at a session organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
“Around 200 plus processes are in the pipeline which will be completed by September 2020,” he said.
Besides onboarding weavers and craftsmen to promote domestic industry, the platform is working with banks to provide uncollateralised working capital credit for sellers.
Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech had said that the government intends to create a unified procurement system for the public sector by providing a single platform for procurement of goods, services and works, that will benefit MSMEs.",business
Minimum support price on sugar to rise," The government is likely to hike the fair and remunerative price of sugarcane to Rs 285 per 100 kg and also the minimum support price  for sugar to Rs 33 per kg.
The cabinet is likely to arrive at a decision soon to help the mills clear the arrears of cane farmers worth Rs 20,000 crore at the earliest.
Officials said the food ministry has prepared a cabinet note to “fix the minimum selling price of white sugar and also to increase cane FRP (fair and remunerative price)”. FRP of sugarcane is now priced at Rs 275 per 100 kg, while MSP of sugar is Rs 31 per kg.
However, industry sources feel that even after the hike the price of the sweetener will remain below the cost of production of Rs 35-36 a kg. But, it would provide some relief to mills at a time most are facing liquidity issues.
Last year, the government had increased the price at which mills sell sugar to bulk buyers by Rs 2/kg to Rs 31 per kg.

The minimum selling price of sugar is fixed taking into account the components of FRP and minimum conversion cost of the most efficient mills.     
According to the official data, mills have purchased sugarcane of around Rs 72,000 crore from farmers during the 2019-20 cane season (October-September). Of that, around Rs 20,000 crore of arrears are yet to be paid to farmers.
Arrears comprise payments to be made on the basis of the FRP fixed by the Centre, and the state advisory price determined by the states.",business
Car sales down 4% in July," Passenger vehicle sales in the country totalled 1.82 lakh in July, marking a decline of 3.86 per cent from 1.9 lakh units in the year-ago period, data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) showed on Tuesday.
The decline was cushioned by a rise in demand for entry-level cars and motorcycles in the rural and semi-urban markets.
“After a few consecutive months of falling sales in a post-Covid scenario, there are signs of green shoots in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. Sales in August would indicate if this is sustainable demand and not just a pent-up demand,” Rajan Wadhera, president of Siam, said.
According to the  Siam figures, Maruti Suzuki India sold 70,090 units last month compared with 71,486 units in July 2019.
Hyundai Motor India wholesales stood at 19,828 units compared with 22,776 units in the year-ago month.
In the two-wheeler segment, scooter sales fell 36.51 per cent year-on-year to 3,34,288 units, while motorcycles sales declined marginally by 4.87 per cent to 8,88,520 units. Overall, two-wheeler sales fell 15.24 per cent to 12,81,354 units.
Three-wheeler sales totalled 12,728 units last month, marking a decline of 77.16 per cent from 55,719 units in July last year.
Siam did not provide wholesale dispatches of commercial vehicle in July.
Total production of passenger vehicles, including three-wheelers, two-wheelers and quadricycles, in July was 17.15 lakh units against 24.28 lakh units a year ago.

"HDFC, Axis achieve fund-raising goals"," The country’s largest pure play mortgage lender HDFC on Tuesday said it has raised close to Rs 14,000 crore by issuing shares to qualified institutional investors and through non-convertible debentures.
The Government of Singapore received 13.37 per cent of the shares allotted (75.9 lakh shares), while Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund received 5.54 per cent (3.2 lakh shares).
In a separate announcement, Axis Bank said it has raised Rs 10,000 crore through a QIP (qualified institutional placement) issue. HDFC disclosed that it has raised Rs 10,000 crore, allotting 5.7 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 1,760 per share. 
The price represents a discount of 1 per cent to the closing price of its equity shares on the stock exchanges prior to the launch of the issue. The HDFC stock on Tuesday ended with gains of 1.48 per cent at Rs 1,825.35.
HDFC said it has received Rs 307.03 crore upfront through the issue and the allotment  of 1.7 crore warrants at an issue price of Rs 180 per warrant.

The warrants entitle the holder to exchange each warrant for one equity share of HDFC at any time over the next three years until August 10, 2023 at a pre-agreed price of  Rs 2,165.
The warrant issue price together with the warrant exercise price represents a premium of 32 per cent to the closing price of its shares prior to the launch of the issue.
In addition, HDFC raised Rs 3,693 crore through the issue of redeemable non-convertible  debentures for a tenor of three years, carrying an annualised coupon rate of 5.40 per cent per annum. It added that the issue has been over-subscribed overall.
“Assuming all the warrants are exercised by investors within the next three years,  the corporation would receive an additional Rs 3,386 crore by way of securities  premium. Accordingly, the maximum equity dilution possible under  the  issue would be up to 4.26 per cent of the enhanced equity share capital of the corporation,” HDFC said.
Axis Bank too saw good response to its QIP offering from the global and domestic investor community, including several large FPIs, domestic mutual funds and insurance companies. The deal was over-subscribed with the aggregate size being Rs 10,000 crore.
The issue was done at a price of Rs 420.10 per share ,a discount of five per cent to the floor price of Rs 442.19 per share.

Food retail prices up in July," India’s retail inflation edged up slightly in July due to higher food prices, remaining firmly above the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 per cent for a 10th straight month, a Reuters poll showed.
Food prices, which account for nearly half the inflation basket, have soared since April because of supply-side disruptions caused by a nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
While the central government gradually eased restrictions in June, regional lockdowns in some major agricultural producing states continued to disrupt supplies of essential perishables like fruits and vegetables.
The August 6-10 Reuters poll of over 45 economists showed Indian retail inflation rose to 6.15 per cent last month from 6.09 per cent in June.
Forecasts for the data, scheduled to be released on August 12, ranged from 5.00 per cent to 6.55 per cent.

“We see July CPI inflation to be steady above the Reserve Bank of India’s policy limit. Food remained a dominant inflation driver but high utility and transport costs also contributed,” said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING. Reuters
The government suspended the release of CPI inflation headline numbers for April and May due to insufficient data during the lockdown.
The RBI kept interest rates on hold last week after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February - despite a recent rise in retail consumer prices - but said it would ensure inflation remains within target.
According to the RBI’s latest survey, household inflation expectations for the three-month and one-year horizons rose to over 10% in July, suggesting Asia’s third-largest economy could enter a period of stagflation - a phase with lofty inflation, high unemployment and stagnant demand.
“With inflation expected to remain elevated on supply side disruptions, we think a rate cut is more probable in December,” said Rini Sen, India economist at ANZ.
“We expect food prices to abate likely from September onwards, once the rabi crop (summer harvest) enters the market.”
Monsoon rains, which are critical for farm output and economic growth, are expected to be 104% of a long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.",business
Fitch: Worry over debt recast," The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision on the one-time restructuring of stressed advances may delay bad loan recognition, Fitch Ratings said on Monday.
Last week, the RBI had allowed banks to restructure loans facing stress because of the Covid-19 crisis.
Fitch said there would now be more uncertainty over the asset quality of banks.
The recast opens a window for banks to build capital buffers while putting off the full recognition of the pandemic’s impact on loan portfolios. The mechanism is reminiscent of a strategy adopted over 2010-2016 that delayed and exacerbated problems for the banks, the ratings agency said.
Fitch pointed out that the scheme may be designed to give banks more time to raise capital to address the impact of the crisis on loan portfolios.

The ratings agency said PSU banks may find it difficult to raise funds as investors may be reluctant to participate in the sales of stakes in state-owned lenders until the impact of the pandemic on their balance sheets is clear.
It also felt that delaying the recognition of problems in the banking sector could provide some short-term support to economic growth by stimulating credit issuance.
“However, many state banks may remain reluctant to lend to all but the most creditworthy borrowers in the near term, as their overall weak capital position remains unsupportive of growth — even with impaired loans permitted to be classified as ‘standard’ after rescheduling,” the rating agency noted.
Besides, the attempts to restructure debts between 2010 and 2016 were characterised by poor implementation and weak monitoring. The central bank has, however, looked to address this concern by tightening supervision through the Kamath  Committee, which will vet all restructuring plans involving creditors with more than Rs 1,500 crore of debt.",business
Industrial production falls 16.6 per cent in June," Industrial production fell 16.6 per cent in June, the fourth straight month of contraction — but pent-up demand burst through during the month as a result of which the pace of contraction was a lot slower than in the previous three months.
According to the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data, manufacturing sector production registered a decline of 17.1 per cent, while the output of mining fell 19.8 per cent and power, 10 per cent.
Industrial production contracted 34.7 per cent in May after falling 57.6 per cent on a yearly basis in April. IIP had expanded 1.3 per cent year-on-year in June 2019.
The contraction will be still less in July, according to Aditi Nayar, principal economist of Icra, based on various lead indicators such as the output of Coal India Limited, electricity consumption and GST e-way bills that contracted in narrow single-digits in July.
“Nevertheless, we continue to caution that pent-up demand contributed to the improved performance of certain categories of manufacturing in June-July 2020, which may not sustain in August 2020 especially in the light of the extension of localised lockdowns in various states,” she said.

Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings, said some industries restocked goods which were depleted in April and May when production was hindered by the lockdown. He said there appeared to be a positive relation between the unlock process and the IIP growth numbers.
“While it has been negative in the three months, there has been improvement in May over April and improvement in June over May.”
“While there still exists localised lockdowns in several geographies production will be impacted in July and August for sure and we may expect negative growth in these months,” Sabnavis said.
He said the strong decline in the first quarter will weigh heavily on GDP growth estimate for the quarter which can tend towards -20 per cent.",business
Lockdown: Surge in demand for cheaper homes," Pent up demand created during the lockdown period has induced a spike in booking for apartments in the last two months, bringing relief to the hapless developers who expect the momentum to continue only if there is a corresponding uplift in the overall economy.
City-based developers and brokers say enquiries have gone up and the number of bookings have increased in June and July compared with the previous two months, but they are still far away from the pre-Covid levels.
“Enquiries which had completely stopped have started coming back a bit. Properties priced below Rs 1 crore has traction and ready-to-move (RTM) apartments have an edge over unfinished ones. I believe well known brands will do better in the current scenario,” Harsh V. Neotia, chairman of Ambuja Neotia, said.
Sanjay Jain, managing director of Siddha, agreed. “Seeing demand for RTM properties in one of our projects in north Calcutta, we are readying 100 more units to bring to the market,” said Jain, who claimed sales are back to 60-70 per cent of normal times.
NK Realtor, one of the top city-based brokers, says three out of four properties booked in the last four months are under the Rs 50 lakh bracket. Biplab Kumar, vice-president of NK, said there has been a month-on-month improvement in booking with the best seen in July.

There is a changing bias towards large complexes post Amphan and during the pandemic. Around 47 per cent of the 500-odd respondents to a survey conducted by the brokerage say they prefer to stay in projects having 500-plus apartments.
Visible advantages of staying within a gated community during a crisis is drawing buyers in Calcutta and beyond. Arya Sumant, managing director of Eden Realty Ventures, witnessed more bookings in June-July than November-December in his ultra-affordable project (Rs 9 lakh-Rs 23 lakh) in Serampore.
“I was really surprised. Believe that the fence sitters came forward. It was more of a pent up demand created during lockdown,” Sumant said.
But he had a word of caution too. “How the rest of the year is going to pan out will depend on the economy. If there is no job security, how many people would come forward to buy property? After all, one takes a long term view of income while taking a home loan,” Sumant said.
Jitendra Khaitan, chairman and managing director of Pioneer Properties, noted that only serious buyers are in the market.
However, that would not necessarily mean that all bookings would translate into agreement for sale. “There is at least 10-15 per cent cancellation from booking usually. Given that many developers offered easy exit terms, the number may rise,” an industry source pointed out.
Sidharth Pansari, managing director of Primarc, however, sees little challenge in existing projects. “If you have built a reputation for delivering quality projects on time, there should not be any problem,” Pansari said, adding focus on right size and pricing has paid off during this time.
Few launches, loans scarce Knight Frank, an international property consultancy, noted that there have been no launches in the Calcutta market during April-June. Neotia said he didn’t expect launches before November.
Top developers sell around 11,000-12,000 units a year on an average. The Knight Frank report suggests 2,937 units were sold during January-June, all of which took place before lockdown.
The report says more than 30,000 units continue to remain unsold as on June 30.
The bias towards RTM properties also means that there is an incentive for builders to complete existing projects rather than taking up new ones which typically takes 36-48 months to complete. Bank finances have also become scarce and costlier, said Surekha Bihani, managing director (East) of JLL India.
Even though many projects have been registered with state regulator from April onwards, builders are wary of bringing them to the market, fearing lack of demand. This, however, does not mean that there is any dearth of choice.",business
JSW Steel July output falls 5%," JSW Steel on Tuesday said its crude steel production during July stood at 12.46 lakh tonnes (lt), down 5 per cent from the same period a year ago.

Equity mutual funds see outflow for first time in 4 years," Equity mutual funds saw their first outflow in four years in July as profit booking by investors saw them making net withdrawals of Rs 2,480.35 crore. In the preceding month, the net inflows into these schemes stood at Rs 240.55 crore. 
The schemes have been showing a declining trend since April, attracting Rs 11,723 crore in March, Rs 6,213 crore in April and Rs 5,257 crore in May.
Data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) on Monday showed that the outflows were maximum in the case of multi-cap funds at Rs 1,033 crore (net outflows of Rs 778 crore in June). It was followed by mid-cap, contra and focussed funds. Barring equity-linked saving schemes that saw an inflow of Rs 279 crore) and focused fund (Rs 535 crore) categories, all the other equity segments witnessed a net outflow.
Experts said that the net outflow was because of profit booking by investors amid concerns about expensive valuations in the market despite the rising number of coronavirus cases in India and an economy under contraction. 
Overall, the mutual fund industry witnessed a net inflow of Rs 89,813 crore across all segments last month, much higher than Rs 7,265 crore seen in June. This inflow has been attributed to the infusion in liquid and low-duration funds. The assets under management (AUM) of the industry as a whole increased 5 per cent to Rs 27.3 lakh crore.

Amfi chief executive N. S. Venkatesh attributed the outflow to withdrawal from multi-cap and large cap funds because of profit-booking by investors.
He added that investor confidence in the market continues to be robust, going by rising net fresh SIP registrations and overall increase in the average asset under management of mutual funds since the pandemic. Debt mutual fund schemes, he noted, are an attractive proposition, with a benign interest rate environment leading to better yields as also superior risk management by the debt fund managers.
“The outlook for the mutual fund flows for the rest of 2020-21 would continue to be encouraging with rising digital-driven inflows, accommodative stance on interest rates by the RBI, improving macro-economic environment and a pick-up in economic activity on the back of easing of lockdown,’’ Venkatesh observed.

Five central trade unions — BMS, HMS, AITUC, CITU and INTUC — last month declared their decision to go on a one-day strike against issues such as commercial coal mining, disinvestment of Coal India and the wages of contract workers. 
However, a deferment of the auction process has now prompted the unions to call off the strike for the time being. 
The auction of blocks earmarked for commercial mining will now take place between October 19, 2020 and November 9, 2020. 
Difficulties in site visits by prospective bidders because of the lockdown and the need to review the initial list of 41 coal blocks after objections were raised over ecological concerns have led to a delay.
“The auction dates have been deferred by the government. So, the strike has also been deferred,” said D.D. Ramandan of the CITU-affiliated All India Coal Workers Federation. 
“A date has not been fixed yet. The unions will meet in October and take a further call on the strike,” said Nathulal Pandey of HMS. 
Informally, it has been discussed among the unions that a protest could happen between November 5 and November 9 ahead of the nominated authority of the Centre recommending the successful bidders on November 11, 2020. ",business
Lockdown: passenger vehicle sales skid 25%," Passenger vehicle sales in July declined 25.19 per cent to 1,57,373 units over the corresponding period last year as the impact of the pandemic on vehicle offtakes continues, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada) said on Monday.
Pitching for industry-specific policies to boost demand for the speedy revival of the auto sector, Fada president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said as the country continues to open up, July saw better registrations compared with June, though on a year-on-year basis recovery in the auto sector is yet to be anywhere near normal.
Two-wheeler sales declined 37.47 per cent to 8,74,638 units last month from 13,98,702 units in July 2019. Commercial vehicle sales declined 72.18 per cent to 19,293 units compared with 69,338 units in July 2019.
Total sales across categories declined 36.27 per cent to 11,42,633 units last month against 17,92,879 units in the year-ago month.
Current market conditions are still not indicative of the actual demand situation on an all-India level and retail sales continue to decline in huge double digits despite the low base of last year. 
The rural market, however, continues to show strong sales growth for tractors, small commercial vehicles and motorcycles as monsoon continues its good spell, Kale said.
Banks and NBFCs though flush with high liquidity are still cautious about funding, affecting demand revival, especially in the commercial vehicle, three-wheeler and two wheeler segments, he added.
Maruti Suzuki India continued to lead domestic passenger vehicle retails in July, followed by Hyundai, Tata Motors and M&M. ",business
"ICICI kicks off QIP issue to mobilise Rs 15,000 cr"," ICICI Bank has set a floor price of Rs 351.36 per share for its qualified institutional placement (QIP) to mobilise Rs 15,000 crore, while InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of budget carrier IndiGo, announced its plans to mobilise Rs 4,000 crore.
Last month, the board of ICICI Bank had cleared a proposal to raise Rs 14,000 crore. 
In a regulatory filing to the bourses after the market hours, the lender said its board will meet on August 14 to determine the issue price for the institutional buyers.
The bank has set the floor price for QIP at a discount of over 3 per cent to Monday’s close of Rs 363.60 on the BSE.
The bank’s issuance committee, which met on Monday evening, decided to open the QIP immediately and set the floor price of Rs 351.36 per share at the end of the board meeting. Mortgage lender HDFC had last week announced plans to raise  Rs 14,000-crore through the issue of equity shares and warrants and up to Rs 9,000 crore via secured redeemable non-convertible debentures. 
HDFC’s  QIP comprised Rs 10,000 crore through equity shares and Rs 4,000 crore from warrants. 
Axis Bank had also witnessed a strong response to its QIP which sought to raise Rs 10,000 crore. 
Earlier, Kotak Mahindra Bank had mobilised Rs 7,000 crore through this route.
The lenders are raising funds as they prepare for a possible rise in bad loans during the second half of this fiscal. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also asked them to shore up their capital base.
ICICI Bank had decided to set aside Rs 5,500 crore as provisions for possible reverses on the loan book in the June quarter, where its consolidated net profit grew 24 per cent to Rs 3,118 crore on the back of one-time gains on stake sales in insurance arms. Analysts are  divided on how the bad loan situation unfolds as some feel that non-performing assets (NPAs) will not see a huge rise after the central bank announced a one-time restructuring mechanism last week. Banks will, however, have to make a provision of at least 10 per cent on cases where such a restructuring has been done.
“We believe that the restructuring will certainly slow down/defer the NPA formation well below the RBI’s expectation, while 10 per cent provisioning cost for banks should discourage unwarranted restructuring,’’ analysts at Emkay said in a recent note.
The financial stability report of the RBI, released last month, had projected that baseline gross bad loans for the system would rise to 12.5 per cent of bad assets and in the worst case to 14.5 per cent during this fiscal from 8.5 per cent as of March 31, 2020. 
The projection did not factor in a restructuring mechanism. InterGlobe Aviation’s board has approved a plan to raise up to Rs 4,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement of shares, subject to the approval of the company’s shareholders and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
Ahead of the announcement, its shares settled 1.43 per cent higher at Rs 952.90 on the BSE.",business
Bank of Baroda reports over Rs 800cr loss," State-owned Bank of Baroda on Monday reported a standalone net loss of Rs 864 crore for the June quarter of 2020 because of higher provisions and contingencies.  
The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 710 crore in the same quarter a year ago. 
“On account of provisioning on standard accounts of Rs 1,811 crore, the bank has reported a (standalone) net loss of Rs 864 crore and a consolidated net loss of Rs 679 crore,” Bank of Baroda said. 
Interest income fell 2.38 per cent to Rs 18,494 crore from Rs 18,944 crore a year ago. 
Total provisions and contingencies for the quarter jumped 71.32 per cent to Rs 5,628 crore from Rs 3,285 crore a year ago. Gross non-performing assets fell to 9.39 per cent of gross advances as on June 30, 2020, from 10.28 per cent a year ago.  Tata group firm Titan Company on Monday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 297 crore for the June quarter, impacted by lower income because of the pandemic. 
The company had reported a net profit of Rs 364 crore a year ago. Total income declined 61.21 per cent to Rs 2,020 crore from Rs 5,208 crore earlier, Titan said. Titan Company managing director C.K Venkataraman said: “The recovery in business, particularly in the jewellery business is encouraging and we expect to get back to normalcy by the fourth quarter of this year.” Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL), a leading PSU oil company in Assam, has recorded a dip in revenue from operations at Rs 14,073 crore in 2019-20 compared with Rs 18,511 crore in 2018-19 because of lower sales and a reduction in prices of petroleum products in the international market.
“Profit before tax fell to Rs 1,735 crore from Rs. 3,052 crore a year ago. Profit after tax decreased to Rs 1,381 crore from Rs 1,968 crore in 2018-19,” NRL said. ",business
Big-hitter Knights face slot riddle," Andre Russell’s batting position had been the topic of debate in the lead-up to this IPL. So much so that Kolkata Knight Riders’ head coach Brendon McCullum had gone on record saying that they would have to strategically consider pushing the all-rounder up in the batting order in some of the matches.
Yet on Wednesday, during their opener against Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi, the KKR think-tank decided to send Russell in at No. 6 when faced with a target of 196.
McCullum’s use of resources while formulating the batting order did hamper their chase to a certain extent. When the need of the hour was big-hitters at the start to set the tempo, they ended up sending the captain Dinesh Karthik and Nitish Rana at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively.
The explosive Eoin Morgan and Russell followed and by the time the pair joined hands in the 12th over, the asking rate was close to 15 an over.
KKR seemed not to have learnt from their mistakes in 2019 when similar instances of not giving Russell enough overs in hand during a big run-chase cost them a few matches. The Jamaican with 510 runs off only 249 deliveries was not only their highest run-scorer last season but also had the tournament’s best strike-rate of 204.81.
“When you’re chasing a big target, then your big-hitters should come up the order,” batting legend Sunil Gavaskar said during a TV show. “We saw this even in the Chennai Super Kings’ chase against Rajasthan Royals — after Sam Curran, MS Dhoni should have come in. Likewise, if Andre Russell came in at No. 4 and Eoin Morgan at No. 5, then it would have made a difference.”
When Russell walked in, KKR needed 120 off 50 balls. But by then Mumbai Indians’ pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult and James Pattinson had a firm grip on the match and effectively shut KKR’s case.
It’s not that Russell has lost his touch. He scored 222 in eight innings at a strike rate of 141.40 for Jamaica Tallawahs in the recently concluded Caribbean Premier League.
For someone as aggressive as McCullum, such strategy seemed inexplicable. The decision to send Rana at No.4 also didn’t work since the conditions demanded someone with abilities to clear a big ground as in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. Had it been Sharjah, Rana wouldn’t have been dismissed caught near the ropes by Hardik Pandya since the smaller boundaries would have come to his rescue.
Such intricate planning of strategy should be the focus of the backroom staff and given the nature of the fast-paced game would depend on the match situation. Alarmingly, KKR’s chase never took off against Rohit Sharma’s men.
Karthik tried to stay clear of talk surrounding the batting order at the post-match media conference. “It all depends on the game and what score we are chasing. The advantage with our batting is we are very fluid,” the KKR captain said.",sports
Frank Lampard’s praise for Kai Havertz," Chelsea manager Frank Lampard was impressed by Kai Havertz’s performance on Wednesday after he netted a hat-trick in their 6-0 League Cup win over Barnsley at Stamford Bridge and said it was just the first of many great nights to come from him.
Havertz struggled in Premier League games against Brighton and Hove Albion and Liverpool but showed why Chelsea spent $90 million to get him from Bayer Leverkusen.
“We had to play him because we had a few injuries...The combinations he had with Tammy Abraham and the three goals were impressive,” Lampard said.

Luis Suarez bids adieu to Barcelona," Luis Suarez highlighted his close friendship with Lionel Messi as he bid a teary farewell to Barcelona on Thursday ahead of his move to La Liga title rivals Atletico Madrid.
Messi had failed to dovetail with other top strikers such as Samuel Eto’o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Villa but took no time at all to gel with Suarez, who became his best friend at the club as well as a prolific strike partner.
“When I got to Barcelona everyone said be careful with Leo, that he was the main striker at the club,” an emotional Suarez said at a media conference attended by Messi and fellow Barca teammates Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba.
“But in our time together we always tried to perform as well as we could and I can leave here feeling very proud.”
Messi also looked set to be leaving Barca before walking back on his threat to end his contract unilaterally, and Suarez lashed out at the stories that appeared in the media about the two players’ influence on the club.

“It has been a crazy month, many things have been said and leaked that were invented, many things that made me angry. But everyone knows how good a relationship I have with Leo,” Suarez added.                                         ",sports
"Rahul leads from front, Kohli falters"," As KL Rahul butchered the Royal Challengers Bangalore bowlers, his “idol” Virat Kohli watched helplessly, stunned to the extent that he, with one of the safest pair of hands in contemporary cricket, even dropped two catches. Ironically, it was Rahul whom he dropped. 
In the end, led by Rahul, Kings XI Punjab thumped Kohli’s men by 97 runs, at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.
Rahul (132 not out off 69 balls), albeit aided by the two reprieves he had late in the Kings XI innings after they were put in to bat, played one of his finest knocks at this level, smashing 14 boundaries and seven maximums that powered his team to 206/3, a total that didn’t look quite possible after the 15th over, especially when they lost power-hitter Glenn Maxwell, who was once again dismissed cheaply.
But Rahul took the onus upon himself and unleashed his fury on the opponent bowlers. The last two overs of their innings yielded Kings XI as many as 49 with Rahul alone hammering 42 of those.
In reply, all that Royal Challengers could manage was a paltry 109 in 17 overs. Their hopes had faded to a large extent when Sheldon Cottrell and Mohammed Shami had them reeling at 4/3 in the third over, and that too with skipper Kohli back in the dugout having scored just one.
After the high of beginning the IPL with a convincing win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, it turned out to be an absolutely forgettable outing for Kohli on the field. Off the field earlier in the day, Kohli had a virtual interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about how the Yo-Yo tests helped Indian cricketers aim for higher-level fitness.
Modi was interacting with fitness experts and influencers from across the country to mark the one-year anniversary of the ‘Fit India Movement’. The Prime Minister also jested with Kohli during the interaction, saying the skipper’s dedication towards fitness and maintaining a healthy diet have brought great loss to Delhi’s chole bhature sellers.
But later in the evening, the loss was all Kohli’s. Before completely miscuing one off the bowling of Cottrell during the Royal Challengers’ reply, he shelled two relatively easy catches to let Rahul off in the 17th and 18th overs of the Kings XI innings. And then rubbing salt to Kohli and his team’s wounds, Rahul launched that assault in the last two overs that gave Kings XI a huge momentum.
Even someone of Dale Steyn’s stature was clobbered for 26 in the penultimate over of the Kings XI innings, with Rahul scoring each of those runs. Shivam Dube then went for 23 in the final over, with Rahul finishing the innings with back-to-back sixes.
Royal Challengers certainly needed another brisk start from their openers Devdutt Padikkal and Aaron Finch. But Cottrell’s pace turned out to be tougher to deal with for young Padikkal, who could last only two balls on this occasion.
Shami made fine use of the seam at the other end and had no problems whatsoever to pick up promising Aussie keeper-batsman Josh Philippe — promoted up the order to No. 3 — trapping him leg-before.
After Kohli’s departure, Finch and AB de Villiers had an Everest to climb. De Villiers did try and put up a resistance, but Kings XI’s leg-spin duo of Ravi Bishnoi (3/32) and Murugan Ashwin (3/21) ensured they kept tightening the screws. Both Bishnoi and Murugan relied mostly on the googly, which helped them account for Finch and De Villiers, respectively.
“I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it. (Dropped chances) Cost about 30-40 runs. If we had restricted them to 180, we wouldn’t have felt the pressure to have a go from ball one.
“There are days when you have these things happening... Just have to accept them,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.",sports
"Eye on MS Dhoni, poser on Ashwin"," Will Mahendra Singh Dhoni bat up the order or again go in at No. 7? That certainly will be an area of interest when Chennai Super Kings face a confident Delhi Capitals in their third game of this IPL at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.
Dhoni did draw a bit of flak for pushing himself lower down the order when CSK were chasing a daunting target of 217 versus Rajasthan Royals in their previous game. And when he did arrive in the middle, he scored only nine off the first 12 balls he faced, leaving Faf du Plessis to do the job all alone, which was rather impossible as the batters before contributed few runs.
The Dubai pitch isn’t quite a batting belter like that of Sharjah, which suggests the Super Kings need to be careful about sorting out their batting order. Coach Stephen Fleming, however, remains optimistic that Dhoni will do better as the tournament progresses.
“As the tournament goes on, MS will just get better and better. To come in and expect him to get a 30-ball 70 would be a tough ask and we’ve other players also who are in good form and can do a job.
“So, it’s valuing what each player can do and also respecting that Dhoni is one of a kind when he’s in form,” he said.
For Delhi Capitals, winning a cliffhanger right at the onset seems to have given them a lot of confidence, though Ravichandran Ashwin’s availability remains uncertain. Mohammed Kaif, the team’s assistant coach, said on match eve a decision on Ashwin’s inclusion would be taken before the game starts. “Our physio Patrick Farhart will take a call on the matter,” Kaif said.
Senior spinner Amit Mishra, who has taken plenty of wickets in the IPL, could be an option to partner Axar Patel if Ashwin is unable to make it.
The Super Kings batsmen didn’t look too comfortable against the Royals tweakers the other night. So if Ashwin does play, Shreyas Iyer and Co. may find themselves with a good opportunity to make perfect use of the situation.
The good news for CSK is Dwayne Bravo progressing well after missing the first two matches due to injury.",sports
"Dean of innovation, doyen of grit"," Dean Jones, a trend-setting one-day cricketer whose career defining innings was, however, a double hundred in treacherous conditions in the Madras Tied Test in 1986, died of a cardiac arrest in Mumbai on Thursday. He was 59 and is survived by his wife and two daughters.
Jones was part of the Star Sports commentary team for the IPL, a tournament he never played in but one he would possibly have excelled in given his range of power shots, ability to improvise, quick running between the wickets and electrifying fielding.
Jones, it is learnt, had breakfast in his hotel on Thursday morning and attended a pre-match briefing session with his fellow pundits. He is believed to have suffered the cardiac arrest in the lobby.
Brett Lee, the former Australia fast bowler, attempted to revive Jones. His death was later confirmed at a hospital in south Mumbai.
“It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing away of Mr. Dean Mervyn Jones AM. He died of a sudden cardiac arrest,” Star Sports said in a press release.     
Jones played in 52 Tests for Australia between 1984 and 1992, scoring 3631 runs at an average of 46.55 with 11 centuries. But it was as an innovator in one-day cricket that Jones, his lips lined with zinc cream, will perhaps best be remembered. He pioneered an aggressive, fleet-footed approach to batting that fetched him 6068 runs in 164 matches at an average of 44.61 with seven hundreds and 46 fifties. He was also part of Australia’s 1987 World Cup-winning team.
Jones burst on to the cricketing centrestage in the first game of the World Championship of Cricket in February 1985 when he, along with Robbie Kerr, put on an entertaining 157-run partnership for the fourth wicket to take Australia to victory against England. Kerr scored 87 not out and Jones made a 94-ball 78 that was marked by powerful shots all around the wicket at the MCG, dancing down the pitch to fast bowlers, and quick running, traits that were still alien to many in ODI cricket of the time.
But his most famous moment would come a year later in the historic Tied Test at Chepauk in Chennai (then Madras), where he battled extreme heat and physical exhaustion to notch a memorable 210 in over eight hours.
So severely dehydrated was Jones that he threw up on a few occasions while batting and had to be admitted to a hospital during the course of the match for intravenous drips.
Allan Border, then Australia’s captain, paid tribute to Jones as “one of the greatest natural cricketers” who, he said, “revolutionised” the game.
How Border had spurred on Jones, a proud Victorian, during the Chepauk innings is also part of cricketing folklore.
When Jones was clearly struggling during his epic knock, Border, batting at the other end, suggested that Queenslander Greg Ritchie — the next batsman in — would be better equipped to handle the stifling conditions.
“I knew Greg Ritchie was in next, and I knew there would be some easy quip I could make to fire him up, so I said, ‘Yeah well that’s okay mate, if you want to go off now we’ll get someone out here tough, we’ll get a Queenslander out here’,” Border would later recall.
“He did stay on… and the legend was born.”
Jones was more or less a fixture in the Test team from then until 1992, an integral part of Australia’s evolution from frequent humiliation to the cusp of global domination. He notched up his highest Test score of 216 against Viv Richards’ West Indies, which had a bowling attack comprising Marshall, Ambrose, Walsh and Patterson, in Adelaide in 1989. A year later, he hit a hundred in each innings (116 and 121 n.o.) against Imran Khan’s Pakistan at the same venue.
His prowess in one-day cricket continued as Jones became arguably one of Australia’s most beloved and popular entertainers, never more so than at his beloved MCG. But somewhere along the way his Test career suffered and he was dropped for the first Test against the West Indies at the Gabba in November 1992, a place he was never to regain.
In January 1993, Jones was engaged in a duel with Ambrose when he asked the big pacer to take his white wristbands off during an ODI at the SCG. Ambrose retaliated by bowing one of the most fiery spells in cricket in that match and in the subsequent games.
A year later, in 1994, Jones played his last ODI.
In his post retirement life he performed the role of a cricket analyst for various channels, primarily in South Asia — India and Pakistan, where he was immensely popular. One of the Indian news channels named him “Professor Deano”, a moniker that stuck with him and was also his Twitter handle. He could polarise opinion and would often get trolled, even on Wednesday he had a social media exchange with a critic of his commentary. He also once courted controversy for calling Hashim Amla “terrorist” on air, a light-hearted comment but the racist undertone forced the particular broadcaster to take him off air. Jones later admitted it was a “silly and insensitive” comment to make.
Jones also had two spells coaching teams in the Pakistan Super League, winning the title in 2016 and 2018 with Islamabad United.
Among a raft of past and current players to pay tribute on social media, former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar said he was heartbroken. “A wonderful soul taken away too soon,” Tendulkar said.
Ramiz Raja, who worked with Jones as a co-commentator, said the news had left him in complete shock.
“One of a kind you were Deano and how lonely and helpless you must have felt on your own in that hotel room - a death we commentators fear the most, and likely to meet, helpless and gone in that hotel room... RIP my friend,” Raja tweeted.  ",sports
Damir Dzumhur threatens legal action against French Tennis Federation," Bosnian player Damir Dzumhur is planning to take the French Tennis Federation to court after he was ejected from the French Open’s qualifying event because his coach tested positive for Covid-19.
According to a report in L’Equipe, Dzumhur is frustrated because his coach, Petar Popovic, contracted Covid-19 in the summer and he believes he is still showing the remains of antibodies. On his return to Serbia, Popovic was tested again and came up negative.
“It’s a scandal and a huge frustration,” Dzumhur said. “I’m sure we’ll win in court, but it hurts a lot.”
The news comes on top of a rocky start to the French Open, which starts in earnest on Sunday. Six players have already been withdrawn from this week’s qualifying because of positive Covid-19 tests.
Behind the scenes, players and coaches have reported a less sophisticated operation than the one run by the United States Tennis Association in New York this month. “Organisation-wise, it is not at the same level,” said the American player Noah Rubin on his Behind the Racquet podcast.
There are also informal reports of the French federation taking a high-handed approach to those who object to the way the qualifying event has been run. According to one source: “Their general attitude is that they are doing the players a favour by staging the event at all.”
In his podcast, Rubin highlighted his concerns about the lack of an immediate quarantine for those arriving at Roland Garros. “You didn’t get a test as soon as you walked into the bubble,” he said. “Players showed up on Wednesday, actually hit on site that day, went out to dinner in Paris, then got a test on Thursday. That just doesn’t make that much sense to me.”
Rubin also said that he had not played a warm-up tournament to arrive in good time. “We know how long it takes for Covid to get into someone’s system or to test positive. For some players to come maybe less than 48 hours before their first match, you’re rolling the dice.”
The US Open created ill-feeling among a group of players — the so-called “Paire 11” — who were confined to their rooms in New York after spending time with the French player Benoit Paire, who then tested positive. Those worst affected were probably Kristina Mladenovic and her partner Timea Babos —  the top seeds in the women’s doubles —  who were ordered to remain in their hotel in Long Island by public health officials, and thus had to concede their second-round match without taking to the court.

English Football and National League Clubs’ fiscal health alarm," More than 10 English Football League and National League clubs could go bust after the return of fans in those divisions was scrapped, a leading football finance expert has warned.
Kieran Maguire, a lecturer in the subject at the University of Liverpool, made the grim forecast after publishing data showing every club in the Championship and all but two in the Premier League would have made operating losses in the season before last had they been deprived of match-day income. Data also showed all but seven sides in League One, five in League Two and three in the National League — many of which do not file detailed accounts — lost money in the same season.
Charlton, Wigan, Oldham and Southend have all previously been identified as being at risk of going to the wall, even before the coronavirus crisis struck, while Gillingham chairman Paul Scally on Tuesday warned his own club could do so by Christmas if supporters remained locked out of grounds.
Maguire said: “There is a danger of a trickle becoming far more than a trickle. Potentially, we could be hitting double figures. If you take a look at the worst years pre-financial fair play, we were seeing around 2003, 2004, seven, eight, nine clubs going into administration, partly on the back of ITV Digital’s collapse.
“What we are facing at present is a far greater hit to the professional sport sector. How can clubs in the National League survive if they can’t play matches in front of a paying audience when 60 per cent or more of their money comes through the turnstiles?...
“Charlton’s very worrying because there’s presently an injunction against the person that wants to buy the club and somebody else who wants to buy the club who has been rejected by the EFL,” he said.

IPL: Kolkata Knight Riders beaten on all fronts," Kolkata Knight Riders got off to a disastrous start in their opener against Mumbai Indians at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Wednesday.
Dinesh Karthik’s men were outplayed and outmanoeuvred in all departments of the game during their 49-run thrashing. In reply to Mumbai Indians’ imposing total of 195 for 5, KKR could manage only 146 for 9.
This was Mumbai Indians’ 20th win over KKR.
Barring winning the toss and dismissing Quinton de Kock early in the second over of the game, nothing fell in place for KKR. The defending champions thus made a superb comeback after a loss in the opener versus CSK. Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma led from the front, top-scoring with a 54-ball 80 — a knock studded with three fours and six over-boundaries. Rohit was severe on the KKR bowler who was expected to bring in the “fear factor” to the opposition — Pat Cummins.
Cummins, however, did perform with the bat, smashing Mumbai Indians’ trump card Jasprit Bumrah for four sixes in the 18th over, which to an extent reduced the margin of their defeat.
There were tactical blunders that ruined KKR’s day. Rohit’s weaknesses against Sunil Narine have been well documented in the IPL, but the off-spinner was brought into the attack only when the Mumbai Indians skipper was well set.
KKR’s ploy of opening the attack with Sandeep Warrier and Shivam Mavi failed to yield any significant result. Perhaps Cummins could have done a better job with the new ball.
During the chase, Nitish Rana was sent ahead of Morgan, which was bizarre to say the least, especially after the openers had fallen cheaply. When Morgan came on to bat, after captain Karthik’s dismissal, he had just too much to do with the required run rate soaring above 14.",sports
"Pretty rusty day, admits Dinesh Karthik"," Kolkata Knight Riders captain Dinesh Karthik admitted it was a disappointing performance in their IPL opener on Wednesday.
“I think we had areas to do well in bat and ball. It was a pretty rusty day to be honest...  I don’t want to get too analytical about it, but the boys realise they could have done better,” Karthik said after the 49-run loss.
“Pat Cummins and Eoin Morgan just finished their quarantine today. So it is not easy to come in and play in this heat,” he remarked.
Karthik evaded a query about a change in their top-order, saying: “I haven’t had the conversation about that with Baz (coach Brendon McCullum) but will let you know by the next game”.
Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma said he was happy with his performance.
“It was all about how we executed our plans today and it was all about being ruthless,” he said.",sports
