S&P affirms India's long-term sovereign credit rating for second time in four months," MUMBAI (Reuters) - Rating agency Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed India’s long-term sovereign rating at the lowest investment grade for the second time in four months on Friday, and it said it expects the economy to rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The news keeps India’s hopes alive of keeping its coveted investment grade, with two other rating agencies - Moody’s and Fitch - having put it on a negative watch at their lowest investment grade ratings earlier this year. India’s long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit was affirmed by S&P at ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook, while the short-term rating was held at ‘A-3’. “The stable outlook reflects our expectation that India’s economy will recover following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the country’s strong external settings will act as a buffer against financial strains despite elevated government funding needs over the next 24 months,” S&P said. The Indian economy will experience a record contraction in the fiscal year to March 2021 on account of the global COVID-19 pandemic but real GDP will recover significantly in FY22, the ratings agency said. India has the second highest virus cases globally despite seeing one of the strictest of lockdowns and cases are still rising as the economy gradually opens up. “We expect economic activity in India to begin to normalize in fiscal 2022, resulting in real GDP growth of about 10%.” The Indian government’s direct fiscal support has been limited to 1.2% of GDP so far compared to roughly 3% of GDP on average in other emerging market economies. S&P noted that the government’s reluctance to provide greater direct fiscal support to the economy likely reflects pre-existing fiscal constraints owing to years of high fiscal deficits. “Although additional stimulus may help to avert a steeper downturn this year, it would also further strain the government’s weak finances,” it said.",Business
Discounts narrow in top hubs as gold price dip attracts some interest," BENGALURU/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Physical gold demand limped higher in top Asian hubs this week, with dealers in India easing discounts to the lowest level in six weeks, as a drop in prices saw a little interest return in the precious metal. Indian dealers offered discounts of up to $5 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, inclusive of 12.5% import and 3% sales levies, down from last week’s $23. The correction just before the festival season could encourage jewellers to build up inventory, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a bullion importing bank. In China, the biggest consumer of bullion, discounts narrowed to $40-$45 an ounce from last week’s $44-$48. “We saw a little bit of buying interest when prices dipped to around $1,850-$1,860, but mostly on the investment side. The retail side is a bit better but still quiet,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer, Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. Spot gold prices hit an over two-month low of $1,847.57 an ounce on Thursday and are down about 4.7% on a weekly basis. [GOL/] In India, the second-largest gold consumer, discounts narrowed after local prices fell to an over two-month low. “As prices are falling, retail buyers are postponing purchases anticipating an even bigger correction,” said Ashok Jain, proprietor of Mumbai-based gold wholesaler Chenaji Narsinghji. Singapore premiums remained around $0.80-$1.50 an ounce over the benchmark prices. “On the retail side, we are seeing a lot more clients coming in and buying gold because they are still bullish on gold, so every time there is correction or pullback many clients are buying,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore. In Japan, premiums rose to $0.50-$0.75 compared with $0.30-$0.50 last week. In Bangladesh, domestic rates were slashed with the best quality gold priced at 74,008 taka ($874.49) per Bhori, or 11.664 grams, tracking global prices amid weak demand.

Vodafone wins international arbitration against India in $2 billion tax case," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L said on Friday it had won an international arbitration case against the Indian government, ending one of the most high-profile disputes in the country involving a $2 billion tax claim. An international arbitration tribunal in The Hague ruled that India’s imposition of a tax liability on Vodafone, as well as interest and penalties, were in a breach of an investment treaty agreement between India and the Netherlands, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. India had claimed a total of 279 billion rupees ($3.79 billion) including about $2 billion in tax, as well as interest and penalties, one of the sources said. The tribunal, in its ruling, said the government’s demand is in breach of “fair and equitable treatment” and it must cease seeking the dues from Vodafone. It also directed India to pay 4.3 million pounds ($5.47 million) to the company as compensation for its legal costs, one of the sources added. Vodafone said in a statement the amount of the award was confidential. Shares in the company's India unit, Vodafone Idea VODA.NS, ended 13% higher on Friday. “The tribunal held that any attempt by India to enforce the tax demand would be a violation of India’s international law obligations,” Vodafone said in its statement. India’s finance ministry said it will carefully study the award, together with its lawyers. “After such consultations, the government will consider all options and take a decision on further course of action including legal remedies,” the ministry said in a statement. “Vodafone has finally got justice first from the Indian Supreme Court and now from an international arbitral tribunal,” said Anuradha Dutt, senior partner at DMD Advocates, an Indian law firm representing the company. The ruling brings an end to one of the most controversial disputes in India under international treaty agreements that it enters into with countries to protect foreign investments. India is entangled in more than a dozen such cases against companies, including Cairn Energy CNE.L, over retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts. The exchequer could end up paying billions of dollars in damages if it loses. To reduce future arbitration claims, India has ended such agreements with over 50 countries and is working on a new law to protect foreign investors by offering relief from possible policy changes even as it upholds the right to tax them, Reuters reported. Vodafone’s tax dispute stems from its $11 billion deal to buy the Indian mobile assets from Hutchison Whampoa in 2007. The government said Vodafone was liable to pay taxes on the acquisition, which the company contested. In 2012, India’s top court ruled in favour of the telecom provider but the government changed the rules to enable it to tax deals that had already been concluded. In 2014, Vodafone initiated arbitration proceedings against India.",Business

Harley close to deal with India's Hero after stopping local manufacturing: sources," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc is in advanced talks with India’s Hero MotoCorp for a distribution deal which will allow the U.S. company’s motorcycles to be sold in India, after it stops local manufacturing there, three sources told Reuters. The Milwaukee-based company said on Thursday it will stop sales and shut its manufacturing plant in India, effectively abandoning the world’s biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold. Harley, however, is in talks with Hero over a distribution arrangement that will allow the Indian company to import and sell Harley bikes as its sole distributor, two sources with familiar with the talks said. “Hero will be the master distributor for Harley bikes in India ... This will be a partnership, a strategic alliance,” said one of the sources, all of whom declined to be named as the discussions were private. Discussions are also ongoing to let Hero become a contract manufacturer for at least one Harley motorcycle with 300-600 cc engine capacity, which it will launch later, the first source added. The financial details of the deal were not immediately clear. Asked about talks with Hero, a Harley spokeswoman said the company would not comment on speculation. On Thursday, it said it was changing its business model in India evaluating options to continue to serve customers. Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer by sales, also declined to comment on market speculation. It produced 6.4 million two-wheeler scooters and motorcycles in the fiscal year ending March 2020, a third of India’s total output. Harley manufactured 4,500 motorcycles during that period, largely assembled from imported knock-down kits at its plant near New Delhi, which it will shut as part of its restructuring. Harley’s decision to stop direct manufacturing marks another major exit by an automotive player in India and is a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has invited foreign firms to ramp up local production. Ford Motor and General Motors have both cut back their India operations in recent years. Harley, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, struggled in India mainly because of high import duties - which U.S. President Donald Trump often criticized India for - and also because its locally assembled bikes faced high taxes. Hero typically sells motorcycles with engine capacity of under 200 cc and a deal with Harley will boost its entry into the mid- and high-engine market favoured by biking enthusiasts and fashion conscious younger riders, the second source said. Harley’s 33 dealerships will likely come under Hero’s management under the new arrangement, said one of the sources. In a statement on Friday, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) in India criticised Harley for not informing dealers about their India plans. “It goes without saying that dealers who have invested their hard-earned capital in this iconic brand are left like an abandoned baby without any compensation package,” FADA said.",Business
"Social media deal earns advertisers' 'likes', but not yet all their dollars"," LONDON (Reuters) - Advertisers who boycotted social media are not all rushing back, despite an agreement by Facebook, YouTube and Twitter on how to curb harmful content online. Unilever, one of the world’s biggest advertisers, told Reuters the move this week was “a good step in the right direction,” but would not say whether it would resume paid advertising on Facebook in the United States next year after stopping over the summer. Coca-Cola also remains paused on Facebook and Instagram and declined to say if this changed its view. Beam Suntory, maker of Jim Beam bourbon and Courvoisier Cognac, plans to stay away from paid advertising for the rest of 2020 and reassess in 2021 based on how Facebook adjusts its approach. Over 1,000 advertisers joined a Facebook boycott over concerns it wasn’t doing enough to combat hate speech. U.S. civil rights groups enlisted multinationals to help pressure the social media giant after the June death of George Floyd, an American Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. “Brands are very concerned about having any affiliation with the disinformation that runs through the big tech platforms,” said Michael Priem, CEO of advertising technology firm Modern Impact. Deciding whether to pull ads from social media can be tough. Larger brands can afford to take a stance, but for smaller businesses that have already been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, “it’s either make it or die,” Priem said. On Wednesday, the World Federation of Advertisers announced that social media platforms and advertisers had committed to create common definitions of harmful content such as hate speech and harmonized reporting standards. A Facebook spokeswoman said on Friday that advertisers were returning to the platform. “For the most part advertisers are coming back because they recognize the efforts we’re making,” the spokeswoman said. “We’re never satisfied. We’ll continue to work with industry and with our clients.” She said that 95% of the hate speech removed by Facebook is detected before being reported, up from 23% in 2017. “Digital media is now more than half of all media spending yet is still operating with very few boundaries other than those that are self-imposed or that marketers try to enforce. It’s time for digital platforms to apply content standards properly,” Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer, Marc Pritchard, said on Wednesday. The maker of Gillette razors and Pampers diapers said it will “continue to advocate for greater transparency, reporting, and enforcement” directly with platforms and through industry forums. Many companies, such as drinks giant Pernod Ricard, returned to Facebook in August after a one-month pause aimed at sending a message. “I feel very happy ... with the outcome. I think it worked,” said Eric Benoist, global marketing director for the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell Cognac. “It was a wake-up call. They heard it loud and clear.” Some advertisers, like spirits group Diageo, came back following direct engagement with the platform and evidence of action. “Some progress has been made, but more needs to be done and we think we’re better able to bring about change by working together,” a Diageo spokeswoman said. “We are in the process of resuming paid media and will continue to drive accountability on these pressing issues.” Campaign organizers remain skeptical and pledged to keep up the heat. “We cannot assume progress from yet another commitment to change until we see the impact and breadth of policy enforcement by these companies,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color Of Change, a backer of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which organized the boycott. “As long as these companies continue to abdicate their responsibility to their most vulnerable users, we will continue to call on Congress and regulatory agencies to intervene.”",Business
"RBI to hold rates as inflation rises, even in recession: Reuters poll"," BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India will keep rates on hold until early next year in a delicate balancing act between curbing high inflation and lifting the economy from its worst recession on record, a Reuters poll of economists showed. August inflation, at 6.69%, held above the top end of the RBI’s medium-term target range of 2-6% for the fifth consecutive month amid supply disruptions, while coronavirus infections spread in India at the fastest pace anywhere in the world. The central bank held its main repo rate at 4.0% at its meeting last month and said it would keep policy accommodative to support an economy which nosedived 23.9% last quarter, the weakest performance on record. All 66 respondents expected no change at the Sept 29-Oct 1 meeting and the consensus showed rates would remain on hold in December, according to the poll which was conducted over the last few days. That compared with a quarter-point cut in the fourth quarter predicted a month ago. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is then forecast to cut its repo rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% in the January-March quarter, holding until at least the end of the next fiscal year. “The current stagflation conditions are putting the MPC in a difficult position. Disrupted supply chains caused by irregular lockdowns will keep inflation elevated,” said Hugo Erken, head of International economics at Rabobank, referring to a state of persistent inflation but with no growth. “Given the inflation mandate of the RBI, the risk of high inflation becoming entangled in high inflation expectations and policy credibility, we feel the RBI will keep the status quo.” The economy, which was already weakening before the pandemic struck, is expected to mark its first full-year contraction since 1979 this year as millions are left unemployed in the world’s second most populous country. [ECILT/IN] That suggests more support is needed despite $266 billion of announced government stimulus and a cumulative 115 basis points worth of RBI rate cuts since late March. “While the system is awash with liquidity currently and real interest rates negative, there are no takers for these cheap funds just yet,” said Prakash Sakpal, senior Asia economist at ING Financial Markets. “Bank lending growth remains on a steady downward path. Therefore, any additional easing isn’t going to be of any use.” But one-third of economists, or 22 of 65, predicted the RBI will ease again in December, including three who expected a 50 basis point cut. A further eight of 31 who provided forecasts through early 2022 expect at least one rate hike during that period, underscoring an uncertain outlook for the economy. When asked to rate the RBI’s response to the pandemic, about 90% of economists, or 49 of 56, said it was about right. (For other stories from the Reuters global economic poll:)",Business
"Banks, IT lead rebound in Indian shares on fiscal stimulus hopes"," BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares on Friday snapped their longest losing streak since February, boosted by financial and IT stocks, after a media report suggesting more domestic fiscal stimulus was on the way lifted sentiment. The broader NSE Nifty 50 index rose 2.3% to 11,050.25 and the S&P BSE Sensex climbed 2.3% to 37,388.66, after falling for six straight sessions. The Indian government was set to announce a stimulus package ahead of the festive season, aimed at creating jobs and pushing demand to lift the battered economy, a Moneycontrol report said. Both Indian indexes, however, were down nearly 4% in their worst week since early-May, on worries over the impact of surging cases of the novel coronavirus on the global economic recovery. “We may see little bounces ... Fundamentals are as weak as they were three months back,” said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities, Mumbai. The Nifty IT sub-index climbed 3.5%, while the Nifty Bank index gained 2.6%. The positive investor sentiment was also underpinned by a recovery in global shares on hopes of economic stimulus from the United States. Shares of Granules India Ltd rose as much as 9.5% after a report said KKR, Bain Capital, Blackstone were in the race for a majority stake in the pharma company. Shares of Vodafone Idea rose as much as 14.8%, after Reuters reported that the telecom operator’s British parent, Vodafone Group Plc won an international arbitration case against Indian government.

Tech ETF outflows send a wake-up call after sizzling rally," LONDON (Reuters) - Passive investors, the backbone of the Nasdaq’s rally this year, seem to have lost their nerve, pulling massive amounts of cash in recent days from index-tracking technology funds in what many see as an ominous sign for the sector. With the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 down more than 13% after a record 84% rally off March lows -- in correction territory -- many investors are speculating that a reversal could pick up speed as a COVID-19 vaccine gets closer. Goldman Sachs, for example, predicts at least one vaccine will be approved by the end of this year. That should help broader markets but weaken the case for shares in companies that benefit when people are forced to stay home, whether cloud computing or e-commerce. But exchange-traded funds, which accounted for most of this year’s tech sector inflows, may be the ones to watch. In the week ending Sept. 23, tech-focused ETFs suffered $1.23 billion worth of outflows, the largest since December 2018, when global stock markets tanked, according to Lipper data. September is also the first month of outflows for the tech sector since the COVID-fuelled market selloff in March. (Graphic: Peak tech - ) The figures are significant because ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ ETF tracking the Nasdaq have taken some $20 billion between January and July, according to Reuters calculations based on data from Refinitiv and Wisdom Tree. The other reason to watch ETFs is that flows data is available faster compared with mutual funds. “We think the latest pullback in U.S. equities, from frothy levels, is a chance for investors to diversify their allocation to those parts of the equity market so far left behind, which could benefit Europe,” said Maneesh Deshpande, a U.S. equity strategist at Barclays. For instance, the QQQ fund posted record $3.5 billion outflows on Monday amid a Nasdaq slump, then got $4 billion the following day as sentiment recovered, notes Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. He said the QQQ volatility pointed to “widespread speculation in U.S. technology stocks and that this is increasingly becoming the leading index for sentiment.” Data from other ETF service providers also show outflows. On a three-month rolling basis, the most active ETFs tracking the U.S. technology and growth sectors saw $1.7 billion of outflows, the first negative reading this year, according to Wisdom Tree. Making up around a third of the benchmark S&P 500 index, U.S. tech stocks have been the ultimate pandemic beneficiaries, especially so-called FANGMAN - Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google , Microsoft, Amazon and chipmaker Nvidia. (Graphic: Top five tech stocks' dominance in global markets - ) Money poured in to chase the out-performance of technology shares. Total net assets for a group of technology focused ETFS nearly doubled to $113 billion at the end of August from $64 billion a year ago, according to Morningstar data. U.S. tech mega caps are down more than 13% from a September peak and account for nearly half of the S&P 500 decline over that period. (Graphic: Tech behemoths add trillions in market value - tmsnrt.rs/3iXrSCk) Still, valuations are hovering near 22 times forward earnings for the S&P 500 index, the highest since the dotcom bubble in early 2000. Multiples of some tech stocks are as high as 100 times forward earnings. But some, such as Sumant Wahi, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International, believe this is a temporary correction: “I think the market is digesting some of the large flows we have seen in recent weeks and this is a temporary correction. “Big tech is here to stay.”",Business
Exclusive: India plans $4.6 billion in incentives for battery makers in electric vehicle push - document," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to offer $4.6 billion in incentives to companies setting up advanced battery manufacturing facilities as it seeks to promote the use of electric vehicles and cut down its dependence on oil, according to a government proposal seen by Reuters. A proposal drafted by NITI Aayog, a federal think tank chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said India could slash its oil import bills by as much as $40 billion by 2030 if electric vehicles were widely adopted. The proposal is likely to be reviewed by Modi’s cabinet in the coming weeks, said a senior government official, who was not authorised to comment on the matter and declined to be identified. NITI Aayog and the Indian government did not respond to requests for comment. The think tank recommended incentives of $4.6 billion by 2030 for companies manufacturing advanced batteries, starting with cash and infrastructure incentives of 9 billion rupees ($122 million) in the next financial year which would then be ratcheted up annually. “Currently, the battery energy storage industry is at a very nascent stage in India with investors being a little apprehensive to invest in a sunrise industry,” the proposal said. India plans to retain its import tax rate of 5% for certain types of batteries, including batteries for electric vehicles, until 2022, but will increase it to 15% thereafter to promote local manufacturing, the document said. Though keen to reduce its oil dependence and cut down on pollution, India’s efforts to promote electric vehicles have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations. Just 3,400 electric cars were sold in the world’s second-most populous nation during the last business year, compared to sales of 1.7 million conventional passenger cars. The policy could benefit battery makers such as South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS and Japan's Panasonic Corp 6752.T as well as automakers which have started building EVs in India such as Tata Motors TAMO.NS and Mahindra & Mahindra MAHM.NS. While China accounts for 80% of the world’s lithium-ion cell production, India has introduced stricter investment rules for Chinese companies. It has also slowed down the approval processs for some proposals after a deadly border clash between the two countries in June. The draft proposal said annual domestic demand for battery storage and market size - currently less than 50 gigawatt hours and worth just over to $2 billion - could grow to 230 gigawatt hours and more than $14 billion in ten years time. It did not offer an estimate of how many electric cars it expected to be on the road by 2030. The proposal estimates it would cost firms some $6 billion over five years to set up manufacturing facilities with the support of government subsidies. NITI Aayog has been the driver of several key India government policies including the planned privatisations of a swathe of state-owned companies.",Business
Aboriginal group says Rio Tinto ignored pleas to save sacred cave from blast," MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Ltd. RIO.AX ignored repeated requests from traditional owners for sacred Australian rockshelters to be protected in the months before the site was blasted during a mine expansion, an Indigenous group said on Friday. The world’s biggest iron ore miner in May destroyed the two caves in Western Australia, sparking an outcry from the public and Rio’s investors. One of the caves showed evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation, making it some of the earliest evidence of human civilisation. Representatives of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples sent communications as early as 2008, setting out the importance of the site before preservation efforts picked up in the months before the blast - but they went unheeded, the group said in a submission to a government enquiry. “We are extremely angry that, over an extended period, Rio Tinto did not act on our input nor the input of specialist archaeologists and anthropologists relating to the cultural importance of the Juukan Gorge rockshelters,” the group said. “We are also angry that, once we raised the alarm bells in the months and weeks leading up to the disaster, Rio Tinto ignored our requests and concerns.” Rio Tinto declined to comment on the report but has noted that concerns over the site’s significance were not elevated to senior executives, including Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two others who ultimately lost their jobs over the destruction. The Indigenous group set out a string of perceived failures and what they called “misrepresentation” by the company in their 120-page report, which is likely to ratchet up pressure on Rio’s board, the Western Australian mining industry and the state government, which allowed the blasting. It also accused Rio of withholding important information at critical junctures before the blast and of laying explosives even after agreeing to freeze its detonation plans. “The destruction ... has caused immeasurable cultural and spiritual loss and profound grief to the PKKP People,” the group said. The culture that prioritised profit and minimal heritage preservation was not confined to Rio Tinto, the group said as it called for wider reform of “inadequate” legislation. “The problems within Rio Tinto ... are deep-seated and systemic and revolve around culture and behaviour,” it said. “The same culture is exhibited by the overwhelming majority of resource industry proponents in Western Australia.” The destruction has triggered pledges by other major miners such as BHP Group BHP.AX and Fortescue FMG.AX to review their mine plans. “We believe that Aboriginal culture and heritage is undervalued in Australia and throughout the world. Steps need to be put in place to adequately protect, rehabilitate, capture and celebrate it,” it said. The enquiry continues next month.",Business
Market volatility prompts investors to seek out long-short equity," LONDON, NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stretched valuations and the resulting pullback in equities have prompted more interest in long/short fund strategies that can provide some protection against market declines and wild swings, hedge fund and asset managers say. The S&P 500 index is down nearly 10% from its Sept. 2 peak, and the burst of selling has prompted some managers to seek more protective strategies. The recent selling followed a run-up in stocks, which regained all their coronavirus-induced losses after unprecedented support from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Long-short equity hedge funds, which bet on stock prices rising and falling, lost an average of 5.75% in March when markets plunged. But they went on to gain an average of 13.67% in the first eight months of 2020 and were the best-performing strategy in August, according to data from investment bank Nomura. “We see great demand for strategies that protect from great volatility,” Philippe Ferreira at fund of hedge fund Lyxor Asset Management told Reuters. Part of the protection long-short funds offer is by “shorting” -- borrowing a stock or security from an institutional investor, then selling it back when the price falls, pocketing the difference. Fund research firm Preqin said that hedge fund equity strategies, which includes long/short strategies, accounted for $929 billion of assets under management at the end of June, of $3.6 trillion in total global hedge fund assets. “We are seeing flows into strategies that bring some form of protection,” said Ferreira. “We are not seeing flows into strategies that are highly correlated to the market environment. “There are many long-short that have a long bias and they are left by the sidelines at the moment. Long-short equity that is less correlated is in high demand.” Data from industry tracker eVestment shows searches for long-short equity hedge funds on their database rose to a seven-month high in August, making up 17% of all hedge fund searches, compared with 11.1% in July. Rob Christian, co-head of research and investment management at hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, part of Franklin Templeton Investments, said it’s a “great time” for long-short investing and that clients had been looking to get more defensive. “Broadly, equity investors are trying to reduce their equity risk using long-short managers,” Christian said. For their part, hedge funds running long-short funds say they are seeing renewed interest in the strategy. “My view overall is that long-short equity generally fell out of fashion a few years ago and there is just starting to be a little bit more interest, from our experience,” said Nigel Gliksten, partner at Toscafund Asset Management. Gliksten said Toscafund, which runs a $400 million long-short fund, was receiving more interested calls from investors since the pandemic hit. “We have seen a big increase in inbound enquiries from family offices, institutional investors and banks, to layer in long volatility risk-reducing positions that would effectively create a long-short trade,” said Matt Rowe, chief investment officer at asset-management firm Headwaters Volatility. While many of the hedge funds said investors were at the early stage of their enquiries, some funds were already seeing inflows. BlueBay’s credit long-short fund almost doubled, to $219 million in July from $126 million in October 2019, with the increase due to investor inflows as well as performance, confirmed a spokesman. The U.S.-based long-short credit fund Aristeia International rose to $1.3 billion in July from $1.242 billion in December, according to data compiled by HSBC and seen by Reuters. In long-short equity, Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Fund rose to $1.5 billion in July, from $1.4 billion in November 2019, showed the data. Aristeia Capital and Maverick Capital did not respond to requests for comment on whether the asset growth was due to more investors.",Business

Singapore's August factory output beats expectations on electronics boom," SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s industrial output in August rose 13.7% from a year earlier, surging past economists’ expectations as electronics production rose at its fastest pace in nearly three years, official data showed on Friday. While the jump was accentuated by a comparatively lower base a year ago, economists said it could be a sign of a nascent recovery for Singapore’s economy, which like other countries has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Industrial production marked its first rise after three straight months of contraction. Economists had expected a 4.6% increase, according to the median of their forecasts in a Reuters poll. Singapore’s industrial production last month climbed 13.9% from July and on a seasonally adjusted basis, the data showed. Economists had expected a 2.6% rise on a seasonally adjusted basis. “This manufacturing and electronics growth prints...bodes well for the recovery story for the Singapore recovery in 3Q20,” said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank. Electronics output rose 44.2% in August, data from the Singapore Economic Development Board showed. The semiconductors segment grew 56.9%, supported by demand from cloud services, data centres and the 5G market. Trade-reliant Singapore is headed towards its deepest ever recession because of the pandemic. The country has been gradually lifting some of its lockdown measures to reopen its economy in recent months and signalled it wants to slowly resume tourism and travel. While analysts expect the electronics sector to continue to grow, they warned that overall economic recovery will likely be sluggish. “We are recovering but probably not going to get back to pre-coronavirus levels by the end of this year,” said Barclays Regional Economist Brian Tan.",Business

Julius Baer ordered to pay 150 million Swiss francs over vanished East German cash," ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss private bank Julius Baer could seek to recoup 150 million Swiss francs ($162 million) from UBS after it was ordered on Friday to repay the German government over millions in East German cash that vanished after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

At that time, large sums were moved from an East German foreign trade company to foreign banks, so the money could not be seized by a reunified Germany. For more than 20 years the Federal Agency for Special Tasks (BvS) has been searching for the money which has since been withdrawn from the banks. The agency has also been seeking to make banks involved liable for not preventing these withdrawals. Julius Baer became involved due its acquisition of the former Swiss Bank Cantrade, which it picked up in 2005 when it bought Bank Ehinger & Armand von Ernst Ltd from rival Swiss lender UBS. The matter is related to unauthorised withdrawals between 1990 and 1992 from a Cantrade account of a foreign trade company established in East Germany, Julius Baer said on Friday. The Zurich-based bank has been fighting a long running legal battle against the payment, but Switzerland’s highest court has now given its final decision, ordering Julius Baer to pay 150 million francs. BvS was not immediately available for comment on the decision. The payment, which includes interest, is fully covered by a provision Julius Baer booked in December 2019, the Swiss bank said. Julius Baer said it will notify UBS of the final ruling. It previously said it would pursue Switzerland’s biggest bank for payment under the warranties agreed when it acquired Bank Ehinger & Armand von Ernst from it. UBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ($1 = 0.9265 Swiss francs)",Business
UK public borrowing overtakes financial crisis peak," LONDON (Reuters) - British public borrowing surged again in August to a record high, driven by huge outlays to combat the coronavirus pandemic, with the budget deficit so far this tax year overtaking its full-year peak during the global financial crisis. The government has now borrowed 173.7 billion pounds ($221.8 billion) in the five months since the start of the financial year in April, outstripping the previous record of 157.7 billion pounds set in the 12 months ending March 2010. Government budget forecasters have warned the deficit could hit 372 billion by the end of the tax year, raising borrowing as a share of gross domestic product to 18.9%, a level not seen since World War Two -- far above long-term sustainable rates. Finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Thursday that now was the time to focus on restoring growth, not reducing borrowing, but tough decisions would be needed in the longer term. Despite this, he has cut support for people whose work remains jeopardised by the pandemic. Sunak said that from November the government would only subsidise “viable” jobs, where people were working at least a third of their normal hours, ending a programme where the government had paid up to 80% of furloughed employees’ wages. Many economists and trade unions fear this could lead to a big rise in unemployment for people in sectors such as hospitality, arts and entertainment that continue to bear the brunt of government coronavirus restrictions. Morgan Stanley economists said Sunak may need to reverse course and provide extra support. “We think the risks to the deficit are to the upside, with the Chancellor likely to provide additional support if restrictions tighten further, or unemployment surprises,” Jacob Nell and Bruna Skarica wrote. Borrowing in August alone jumped to 35.9 billion pounds -- just below economists’ average forecast of 38 billion in a Reuters poll -- while July’s figure was revised down by 11 billion pounds to 15.4 billion pounds. Britain’s Office for National Statistics said the revisions partly reflected difficulties assigning government spending to specific months. The Office for Budget Responsibility said borrowing so far this year was about 34 billion pounds lower than in its most recent forecast published on Sept. 8, largely due to a smaller decline in tax revenue than it had expected. But it said government schemes allowing tax deferral, plus the general economic uncertainty, made it hard to know exactly how large the deficit would be at the end of the year. Public sector net debt in August reached 2.024 trillion pounds, or 101.9% of GDP, the highest as a share of the economy since the 1960-61 financial year. Britain suffered the biggest economic hit of any G7 economy from the coronavirus during the second quarter of this year, with output collapsing by 20%, and the Bank of England estimates third-quarter output will be around 7% below pre-crisis levels. Despite heavy borrowing, the British government’s interest costs on financial markets are near record lows, due to global gloom about the economic outlook and a long-term fall in interest rates.

China's Clover says its coronavirus vaccine candidate showed promise in animal test," BEIJING (Reuters) - An experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals appeared to be safe and able to trigger immune responses in animal tests, researchers have said. The result of the study on monkeys comes months after Clover began an early stage human trial in Australia in June, as global drug makers race to develop a safe and effective vaccine that can protect people from the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed nearly 1 million people. Clover’s vaccine candidate, which is partly funded by a global vaccine research coalition, uses adjuvants, ingredients that could boost immune responses, from Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline and U.S.-based Dynavax Technologies. Two doses of the candidate with GSK's adjuvant induced antibody levels in monkeys that are higher than those seen in the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19, researchers at Clover and other Chinese institutes said in a paper published on Thursday ahead of peer-review. bit.ly/365RysT Antibody levels triggered by two doses of the vaccine with Dynavax’s adjuvant, plus alum, were similar to those observed in convalescent patients’ serum, they said. Adjuvants could reduce the amount of antigen, the substance that triggers immune responses, required in each vaccine dose, allowing manufacturers to make more doses. The candidate, called S-Trimmer, did not cause a disease enhancement effect when tested in monkeys, a scenario where the vaccine-generated immunity worsens the disease instead of preventing subjects from getting sick, which experts worry may happen to coronavirus vaccines. Vaccinated animals appeared to be protected from weight loss, fever and organ damage when challenged with the virus after inoculation, the study said. No vaccine candidate has yet been proved to be effective and safe to protect humans from the coronavirus, but at least nine candidates are in the final stage of clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.",Business
Indian Oil seeks petrol after BPCL's post-hiatus purchase," SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp is seeking gasoline, a tender document showed, making it the second refiner from the country looking to plug a gap caused by low crude runs to curb inflating supplies of diesel and jet fuel, industry sources said. IOC, which does not typically comment on its spot deals, is looking to import 30,000 tonnes of gasoline for Oct. 10-11 arrival at Chennai and Kochi through a tender closing on Sept. 29. This comes after Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd bought gasoline from an oil major last week for Oct. 7-11 arrival at Kandla, its first purchase this year. India went on a buying spree in 2019 as refineries upgraded to produce cleaner fuels, causing the country’s monthly gasoline imports to hit an all-time high of about 410,000 tonnes in September last year, official data showed. However, coronavirus lockdowns wiped out most of the demand earlier this year, with India’s August 2020 gasoline imports seen at 30,000 tonnes. “Indian demand for gasoline is (now) super strong. Current (refinery) runs are not adequate and will require some cargoes to be imported in October,” said one of the sources. But Indian refiners are under pressure to keep output low due to persistent weak demand and bad refining margins for diesel and jet fuel, the source added.",Business
New York stays ahead of London in top financial centres survey," LONDON (Reuters) - New York retained the top spot in a survey of global financial centres on Friday, with London strengthening its position in second place just over three months before Britain’s full departure from the European Union. The Global Financial Centres Index (GCFI) is based on a survey by the Z/Yen Group in partnership with the China Development Institute of more than 54,500 assessments collected from 8,549 professionals working in the sector. The assessments look at political stability, regulatory environment, availability of skilled staff, quality of life, infrastructure, availability of capital, market liquidity, reputation and cultural diversity. “GFCI 28 shows increased confidence in the leading financial centres, but a general reduction in confidence in other centres,” said Michael Mainelli, executive chairman of Z/Yen said in a statement. Uncertainty about trade, political stability, and the economic impact of the pandemic has injected more volatility into the index results, he said. “New ways of working are challenging the concept of a traditional financial centre. For example, the physical City of London has had an economically torrid Covid-19, while financial services in Southeast England have had a bumper year.” Shanghai overtook Tokyo to take third place, with Hong Kong and Singapore in fifth and sixth places. While London closed the gap with New York in the latest survey, some respondents said that the impact of Brexit could reduce the attractiveness of the UK capital, hitherto used by global banks as their EU gateway, in the short to medium term. The City of London loses unfettered access to the EU on Dec. 31 after Brexit transition arrangements end, with future access to EU customers set to be patchy.

China gets nod to join FTSE Russell's trillion-dollar WGBI club," NEW YORK/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - FTSE Russell will add Chinese government bonds (CGBs) to its flagship World Government Bond Index (WGBI), the index provider said on Thursday, paving the way for billions of dollars of inflows into the world’s second-largest economy. The CGBs will be included in the index from October 2021, pending an affirmation on March 2021. The addition will be phased into the index over a period of 12 months. “Since being placed on the Watch List, the Chinese authorities have implemented significant improvements to the fixed income market infrastructure, facilitating easier participation by international investors,” FTSE Russell said in a statement. The index includes mostly developed economies and is a major step for Chinese bonds as investors seek safe-haven assets in a zero-interest-rate world. “Because the Chinese domestic monetary policy is not that closely linked with global monetary policy, you do get diversification benefits allocating to CNY bonds,” said Binay Chandgothia, managing director and portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors in Hong Kong. Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, said international investors held 2.8 trillion yuan ($410.12 billion) worth of Chinese bonds at the end of August. “This is very much welcomed,” Pan said in the statement released by FTSE Russell. “PBOC will continue to work closely with industry participants to further enhance relevant regulations and to provide a more friendly, convenient investment environment for investors domestically and aboard.” Chinese government bonds are already a part of the JPMorgan and Bloomberg Barclays index suites. But the FTSE WGBI has a far larger passive band of investors following it. Goldman Sachs estimates there is $2.5 trillion of global cash following the WGBI, and China’s inclusion could drive some $140 billion into mainland bonds over the inclusion period. China is a $16 trillion bond market, with about $1.5 trillion eligible for inclusion in the index according to FTSE Russell.",Business
Ant launches blockchain-based cross-border trade platform ahead of $35 billion IPO," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ant Group, owner of China’s ubiquitous mobile payment app Alipay, launched a blockchain-powered platform for cross-border trade settlements on Friday, as it races to launch more technology products ahead of its blockbuster IPO. The 16-year-old giant, backed by e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai’s tech-heavy STAR Market next month, in what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) - surpassing oil giant Saudi Aramco’s $29.4 billion float last December. Ant is seeking to raise about $35 billion in the dual IPO after assessing early investor interest and based on a higher valuation of about $250 billion or more, Reuters has reported. Ant was previously known as Ant Financial but changed its name this year to rebrand itself more as a tech firm rather than a provider of financial technology due to tighter financial regulations. Its new platform “Trusple”, a contraction of “trust made simple”, is based on the company’s blockchain technology Antchain. Buyers and sellers can upload trading orders to the platform, which automatically generates a smart contract with information such as logistics. The banks of both buyers and sellers can then process payments using Antchain, Ant said. Users of the platform could, for example, include vendors that sell to other businesses via marketplaces such as AliExpress, Alibaba’s overseas e-commerce site. Ant has submitted the most number of blockchain patent applications globally over the past two years, according to patent database IncoPat. The technology, a digital ledger that forms the backbone of many crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, has seen a burst of interest in China since late 2019 when President Xi Jinping said the country should accelerate its development.",Business
Fans of boy band BTS join swarm of Ants chasing South Korea's hit IPO," SEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Eun-hee wants to complete her collection of memorabilia of Korean boy band BTS by bidding more than $120,000 to buy shares in the group’s music label Big Hit Entertainment in South Korea’s hottest IPO, which could even shake money markets. Fervour is building among die-hard South Korean BTS fans to secure at least one share of the K-pop band’s label as order books for next month’s listing opened this week. “I’m adding my support to BTS by buying shares; it will add onto my collection here,” the 51-year-old said in the BTS-themed cafe she runs in Seoul, which is filled with BTS merchandise, from a 47-inch wide photo of band member Jin to toys designed by the group. Big Hit Entertainment is betting that going public will be a smash hit riding on the success of the seven-member band, which has become the first South Korean group to reach No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with catchy song “Dynamite.” There is already insatiable demand for new share listings from South Korean retail investors - known as “Ants” - because government stimulus efforts to bolster the economy after the coronavirus crisis have flooded markets with cash. Analysts predict Big Hit will take the crown as South Korea’s hottest initial public offering, one that the central bank is watching closely as a massive oversubscription for shares could send ripples through short-term money markets. “Gross bids from retail investors could hit 100 trillion won ($85.23 billion), it’s the biggest fish of the year,” said Hwang Hyun-jun, an analyst at DB Financial Investment. “Liquidity party is still on, and the timing couldn’t be better as BTS has just topped the Billboard.” Big Hit is looking to raise as much as 962.6 billion won ($825.9 million) in the IPO that is set to be South Korea’s largest in three years. The offering of about 7.1 million new shares is currently pegged at 105,000 - 135,000 won per share. The final price may be announced early next week or late Friday afternoon. But the stock’s valuation is less of an issue for Kim and other BTS fans - who are called ARMY. Kim and four other fans bidding for shares said they would be lucky to pick up just one share each, even if they place individual bids for tens of thousands of dollars, because of the expected strong retail demand. South Korea’s Ants have been piling in to one IPO after another this year. The September listing of Kakao Games 293490.KQ attracted 58 trillion won in bids from retail investors alone on orders of about 1,500 times the number of shares offered, setting a record. Following the flood of orders for Kakao Games’ IPO, the overnight repo rate dipped to a three-month low of 0.38% on Sept. 3 as brokerages placed hundreds of billions of won in preorder deposits from retail bidders into the market, data from the Korea Securities Depository shows. A Bank of Korea official said the central bank is currently “monitoring the short-term money market as an inflow of funds is expected in the IPO market.” The Big Hit listing is also expected to make the seven BTS members multimillionaires, as CEO Bang Si-hyuk in August gave them 68,385 shares each. ‘DON’T KNOW MUCH ABOUT VALUATION’ Some BTS fans plan to buy Big Hit shares on band members’ birthdays or other anniversaries. “I can see myself buying one on V’s birthday,” said Alice Park, referring to one of the band members. Park, a 28-year-old banker, is taking out a personal loan of “a couple of hundred grand” to make a bid. Fans loading up on shares of music labels is not new to the K-pop scene. Local media has reported that back in 2008, a fan of Girls Generation, an all-female group, bought shares in its label SM Entertainment 041510.KQ for 22.5 million won and watched them rise more than 2,700% in three years. Kim Seo-hyeon, a 12-year-old BTS fan in Seoul, has asked her parents to buy her one share so she could meet the members of the band at a future shareholders’ meeting. “I don’t know about stock valuations. I know my oppas (BTS band members) are rich but I hope me buying shares make them even richer, so that they can buy something nice to wear, that would make me happy.” (This story corrects to fix language)",Business
GM energizes China line-up with electric micro car," BEIJING (Reuters) - When 32-year-old photographer Jaco Xu needed a run-around car for work in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the price tag on the latest micro EV from GM's GM.N China joint venture overcame his qualms about electric vehicles. Xu paid 38,800 yuan ($5,735) for his tiny two-door Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, while the basic model retails for just 28,800 yuan ($4,200), making it China’s cheapest EV. “It feels pretty good. The price is so low and the appearance is simple and beautiful,” said Xu. “Why would I hesitate at that price?” Launched in July, the Wuling MINI is heading a trend towards a new segment of EVs in China following changes to government subsidies - smaller vehicles with less range between charges, but a super-cheap price tag. Despite basic features - no safety air bags, optional air-conditioning and a driving range of less than 200 km (125 miles) due to a smaller battery - buyers have been enthusiastic. SGMW, GM's venture with partners SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS and Guangxi Automobile Group, sold about 15,000 of the vehicles in August, making it China's top-selling EV for the month, surpassing Tesla's TSLA.O popular Model 3. The venture plans to expand manufacturing capabilities of the new model, turning out cars at its plant in Liuzhou as well as its existing facilities in Qingdao, said Zhou Xing, SGMW’s branding and marketing director. “We positioned this model as a ‘people’s commuting tool’,” he said, speaking ahead of the Beijing auto show which starts on Saturday. “Customers can drive their cars to work every day.” The target market includes people like Xu who are looking for a city-run around as a second car, rural buyers who want a vehicle to move goods and young first-time buyers who are motivated by price. Total sales of new energy vehicles -- including electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles -- are expected to reach 1.1 million vehicles in China this year, about 5% of total auto sales. The micro car represents a shift in what typifies a mainstream electric vehicle, as policymakers push for increased EV production and sales have been bolstered by restrictions on petrol-fuelled cars. In response to government requirements to win generous EV subsidies, automakers over the past decade have developed higher energy-density battery systems to allow cars to drive for longer with a single charge. Tesla’s Model 3, which has a range of over 400 km, has been the market leader in China for most of 2020, retailing for about $43,000, about 10 times the cost of the Wuling MINI. However, China cut subsidies heavily in 2019 and is now asking for higher EV power efficiency to save energy. Automakers, in turn, are planning more smaller EVs with a moderate driving range aimed at customers who can charge cars easily, industry executives said. The economics are skinny. Wuling MINI will not get EV subsidies due to its short range. For SGMW, the cheap price tag means it makes very little money at best, according to insiders familiar with the matter. EVs, however, generate green credits for SGMW that can be used to offset negative credits of other companies like SGM, its sister venture which is expanding a lineup of bigger SUVs under Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac marques. “Selling micro EVs in China makes more sense this year,” said a product planning official at a GM rival. “Subsidies have become a less important factor of pricing as government has already cut a lot, while green credits are expected to become more expensive,” the official said. Bidding to reverse a sales decline due to a slower economy and stiff competition, GM expects EVs to make up more than 40% of its new launches in China over the next five years. The Detroit automaker is revamping plants in Shanghai, Wuhan and Liuzhou under its two Chinese JVs to enable production lines making gasoline cars to turn out EVs, public documents detailing its constructions plans show. For now, the Wuling MINI is the cheapest EV, but it faces competition from the cheapest models from rivals BYD 002594.SZ and BAIC BluePark 600733.SS. Great Wall Motor 601633.SS and Toyota's 7203.T China partner GAC 601238.SS are also planning more electric models with a range below 400 km, company officials said this month. And startup Kaiyun Motors is trying to radically lower the price of its new electric pickup truck Pixel to around 20,000 yuan for urban delivery services, although these EVs will be sold without batteries, allowing consumers to swap them. “China is a huge market, any product with clear positioning can attract enough customers to survive,” said Kaiyun founder Wang Chao.",Business
"BPCL sale may be delayed until next fiscal year, worsening federal deficit woes - sources"," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s efforts to privatise refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. could spill over into the next fiscal year, according to a government document and sources, hurting New Delhi’s efforts to rein in a ballooning fiscal deficit. The privatisation of key companies, including BPCL, is a key part of government plans to pare the fiscal deficit, which has breached its target level just four months into the current fiscal year. Industry sources last year estimated the government’s 53.29% stake in BPCL could fetch $8 billion to $10 billion. With India’s economy contracting by a record 23.9% in the June quarter due to COVID-19, a delayed sale of BPCL could hinder the government’s ability to generate funds for stimulus efforts aimed at restoring growth. New Delhi’s plan to sell its stake in BPCL was first announced in November 2019, and is part of a broader program to spin off or sell stakes in dozens of state-owned companies. The sale has been targeted for completion in the current fiscal year at end-March, but the deadline for initial expressions of interest was pushed out by two months due to pandemic-related movement restrictions that have prevented potential buyers from inspecting the facility. A sale status report issued last month and reviewed by Reuters showed the sale was only due to complete the third step of a 25-step process established for government divestments this month. The document suggests it could take as long as another 21 months for the sale to be completed, although some stages could be carried out concurrently. Potential buyers still needed to attain security clearance, conduct valuation assessments and agree financial terms. “This looks challenging. But we are doing our best to complete the transaction in this financial year,” a senior government official familiar with the sale told Reuters. A second official said the process could take at least 7-8 months more, which would delay completion until at least the end of April, and mean that the proceeds of any sale would only hit government coffers next fiscal year, which begins on April 1 “It may not be possible for overseas companies to do due diligence as air travel is restricted,” added a third official involved in the privatisation process. All three officials declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The sale also faces domestic opposition. The state government of Kerala, where BPCL’s 310,000 barrels per day Kochi refinery is located, fears job losses and plans to challenge the privatisation in the Supreme Court, its industry minister EP Jayarajan told Reuters. Companies including Saudi Aramco and Rosneft have indicated they would look at BPCL since the privatisation plan was announced. BPCL shares have fallen more than 20% since November last year. Interest may be dampened as the industry looks to shift to greener energy investments. The government had budgeted collections of over $27 billion from privatisations and minority stake sales of state-owned companies this fiscal year, but had raised only about $775 million after the first 6 months.",Business

China's Qingdao finds coronavirus on seafood importer's goods," BEIJING (Reuters) - Health authorities in China’s eastern city of Qingdao have found coronavirus contamination on some packages stored by a seafood importer after two of its handlers tested positive for the virus but displayed no symptoms. China has stepped up checks on frozen food imports and banned those from some foreign meat processing plants amid the global pandemic. Thursday’s results came during a routine test of the company’s staff, although none of the two affected men’s 147 close contacts tested positive, the Qingdao Municipal Health Commission said in a statement. The importer’s products and facilities generated 51 positive test results, but no tainted products made it to market, the commission said, without identifying the items or their origins. Chinese customs have threatened a week’s suspension of imports from companies whose frozen food products test positive for the virus, with third-time offenders subject to four weeks. Heavy traces of the virus were found in the meat and seafood sections of a market in the capital Beijing that was the site of an outbreak in June.

"G7 ministers back extension of debt freeze for poorest nations, urge reforms"," WASHINGTON/TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - G7 finance ministers on Friday backed an extension of a G20 temporary freeze in debt payments and recognized the need for broad debt relief in the future, while taking aim at G20 member China over a lack of transparency in its lending. The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), approved in April, is aimed at helping developing countries get through the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. So far, it has helped 43 countries defer $5 billion in official debt service payments. However, in a joint statement, the G7 ministers said they “strongly regret” moves by some countries to skip full participation in the DSSI by classifying their state-owned institutions as commercial lenders. While the statement did not mention China specifically, G7 officials said the message was clearly aimed at Beijing, which has failed to include loans by state-owned China Development Bank and other government-controlled entities in its official debt totals when dealing with countries seeking debt relief. “China’s participation in DSSI is totally insufficient,” Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters after a G7 teleconference. “I told (the) G7 that we must apply further pressure on China, that DSSI needs to be extended beyond this year-end deadline, and that we must ensure burdens will be shared fairly by all creditors.” Restrictions enacted to combat the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected nearly 32 million people worldwide, have hit poor countries especially hard and threaten to push over 100 million people into extreme poverty. The pandemic will force many countries that already faced crushing debt levels before the crisis to restructure their loans or face default. G7 ministers acknowledged that some countries will need further relief beyond the current freeze in official bilateral debt payments, and urged the Group of 20 major economies and Paris Club creditors to agree on common terms for restructuring those debts by an Oct. 14 meeting of G20 finance ministers. “This is not just a liquidity crisis, we need to tackle debt sustainability and go for debt cancellation,” said Iolanda Fresnillo at Eurodad, a network of 50 non-governmental organizations from 20 European countries. “By just postponing the payments you are not solving the problems these countries are facing.” Friday’s statement reflects growing recognition that the program has fallen short of its targets. The savings made are far short of the $12 billion initially projected, with some 30 eligible countries choosing not to ask for forbearance for fear of harming their ability to borrow in the future. The ministers said the initiative should be extended “in the context of a request for IMF financing,” a nod to the Fund’s strict conditions for global lending, and called for development of a new term sheet and memorandum of understanding to improve implementation of the G20 initiative. That effort should focus on key features for debt treatment beyond the temporary freeze and “fair burden sharing among all creditors,” they said. In addition, all claims classified as ‘commercial’ under DSSI would be treated as such in future debt treatments and for implementation of IMF policies, the ministers said, a policy that could leave China’s lending more exposed in the event of a future restructuring. “Pressure is mounting on China,” said Eric LeCompte, a United Nations finance expert. “They’re being very specific here. All Chinese government entities should stop taking debt payments from poor countries.” The ministers called again on private lenders to participate when requested, noting that their absence from the process has limited the potential benefits for several countries. The G7 finance ministers’ backing for an extension will smooth the way for a decision by the larger G20, with a formal decision likely at their leaders’ summit in November. Writing in a tweet, World Bank President David Malpass welcomed the G7’s call for an extension, more debt transparency, and action on debt relief beyond just suspension and urged speedy action to help poor countries.",Business
U.S. wants to ensure more children transported in rear-facing car seats," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators on Thursday proposed revising recommendations to increase the number of children age 1 or younger who are transported in rear-facing car seats. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is proposing to recommend that all children 26.5 pounds or less are transported in rear-facing car seats rather than the existing recommendation for children 20 pounds or less. The agency said it was “significantly safer” for young children to be rear-facing than forward-facing in a crash. NHTSA also unveiled a new crash test dummy, known as the Q3s, representing a 3-year-old child, and designed for use in testing child seats in side impact crash tests. The agency first proposed use of the dummy in 2013 in response to a congressional mandate. NHTSA said manufacturers will not be required to use the Q3s or assess the performance of their products in the manner specified in the standard. The agency added child restraint manufacturers “would be affected by this final rule only if they choose to use the Q3s to test their products.” NHTSA estimated that child restraints for children less than 1 year old can reduce the risk of fatality by 71% in a passenger car and 58% in light trucks; for children between 1 and 4 years old, child seats reduce fatality risks by 54% in passenger cars and 59% in light trucks.",Business
Exclusive: Chinese state investors to take BMW partner Brilliance private - sources," HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state-backed investors are considering taking BMW’s main Chinese joint-venture partner Brilliance private, five people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, in the latest such deal targeting beaten down Hong Kong-listed stocks. Shares in Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd reversed losses and rose as much as 12.3% to HK$7.86 on Wednesday afternoon, their highest since Aug. 17, following the news. The company has a market value of $4.6 billion. The deal to take it private would be led by state-controlled Liaoning Provincial Transportation Investment Group, which owns 12% of the automaker, the sources said. The privatisation would attract other Chinese state-backed investors and could kick off as soon as the fourth quarter of the year, said two of the people. Liaoning’s state asset regulator and Brilliance’s parent, Huachen Automotive Group, said they had not obtained any relevant information about Liaoning Transportation Investment Group considering leading the deal. Brilliance, Liaoning Transportation Investment Group and BMW did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be identified as the matter was confidential. Based in northeastern Liaoning province, Brilliance is 30% owned by Huachen Group, which is majority-owned by the provincial state asset regulator. The regulator supports the proposal and Liaoning Transportation Investment Group has talked to several banks about financing, said three of the people. Prospective investors believe Brilliance is undervalued in Hong Kong, the sources said, as the automaker is trading at 3.67 times expected earnings, way below the industry’s median multiple of 14.4, according to Refinitiv data. Hong Kong’s market has also underperformed major peers so far this year, with the blue-chip Hang Seng Index down 16% as of Wednesday, compared with a 14% gain for China’s CSI 300. Brilliance shares have fallen 10% in the same period. The privatisation would come ahead of BMW buying another 25% to take control of the JV - BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) - for 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in 2022. Based on that offer, Brilliance’s current 50% stake in the venture, which contributed to almost all the listed firm’s profit in 2019, would be worth 7.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion), 83% higher than its market value. Its stake will halve to 25% after BMW increases its share. While the take-private proposal will not impact BMW’s plan to increase its stake in the JV, Brilliance’s valuation is likely to weaken after it loses control of the venture even though it is likely to remain profitable, the sources said. Hong Kong-listed companies have announced take-private deals worth $17.8 billion so far this year, more than double last year’s annual volume, often citing undervalued shares as a reason. The average premiums paid by buyers for those deals jumped to 46% in 2019 and this year, from 34% in 2018, according to Refinitiv data. Brilliance also owns 51% of a venture with France’s Renault SA making vans and sport-utility vehicles, and a stake in an auto-financing firm. It has yet to be decided if Huachen Group plans to divest its stake in Brilliance, said the people, adding the Liaoning government is planning a major restructuring of the debt-laden group. Huachen’s debt totalled 133 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) as of the end of June, with short-term borrowings reaching 16.5 billion yuan. Its cash balance was 32.6 billion yuan, versus 37.8 billion yuan at the end of 2019. ($1 = 0.8578 euros)",Business
Wall Street closes up on tech rally despite mixed signs on economic rebound," (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied in a rocky session on Thursday as beaten-down technology shares gained favor after data showing a surge in the sale of new homes revived faith in the economic recovery even as U.S. jobless claims rose unexpectedly. Stocks also reacted positively to news of efforts to enact further stimulus in Washington, helping lift the S&P to a session high, although the index then turned negative before retracing some gains. Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Facebook Inc .FB.O, stocks that have outperformed at a time of increased economic uncertainty, all rose. The wild session indicated caution was in store, said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC, who warned market sentiment that drove momentum has sharply changed. “Fear of missing out has turned into to fear of losing actual money,” Dick said. “This is a shakeout of all the Robinhood traders, a shakeout of retail investors. They’re getting punished, and rightfully so, because you can’t just buy stocks out of a hat thinking stocks only go up.” Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week, a key lawmaker said, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated she is ready to negotiate with the White House. Wall Street started the day lower after the jobless claims data. The S&P 500 briefly fell 10% below the intraday record peak it hit Sept. 2 for the second time in recent days. Dow constituents, considered a barometer of economic confidence, lagged the S&P 500 as data showed 870,000 Americans applied for jobless benefits in the week ended Sept. 19, up from 866,000 in the previous week. Homebuilders .SPHOME rose 0.73% after the Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose to their highest level in nearly 14 years in August. That report followed data this week showing sales of previously owned homes also near a 14-year high. Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes, said notwithstanding spats of poor data, the U.S. economy is on a path to a powerful V-shaped recovery as seen in auto sales, the housing market and overall consumer spending. “All of the inventory rebuilding is starting, all of the things you want to see are happening,” Orlando said. “Now, are there some chinks in the armor? Yes, just saw it in the claims numbers this morning.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 52.31 points, or 0.20%, to 26,815.44. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.67 points, or 0.30%, to 3,246.59, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 39.28 points, or 0.37%, to 10,672.27. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.43 billion shares, up from 10.04 billion shares on Wednesday. The CBOE volatility index .VIX, known as Wall Street's fear gauge and which is hovering near two-week highs, is expected to climb in the run-up to the quarter-end next week. “The key is the VIX index, which has not yet reached levels that would suggest a continued strong move to the downside,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “So you might get a day of bargain hunting followed by a day of selling, but as the last days of September come into place, we should begin to see some sort of window dressing by institutions.” Nikola Corp NKLA.O, which is set for its biggest weekly decline ever, slid 9.69% as Wedbush downgraded the stock to ""underperform."" Accenture Plc ACN.N fell 7.04% after the IT consulting firm forecast current-quarter revenue below expectations, while U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry Ltd BB.N initially jumped after the Canadian security software firm posted a surprise rise in quarterly revenue, but finished the day lower. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.36-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Apple critics form coalition to challenge App Store fees," SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A group of Apple Inc’s critics - including Spotify Technology SA, Match Group Inc and “Fortnite” creator Epic Games - have joined a nonprofit group that plans to advocate for legal and regulatory action to challenge the iPhone maker’s App Store practices. Apple charges a commission of between 15%-30% for apps that use its in-app payment system and sets out extensive rules for apps in its App Store, which is the only way Apple allows consumers to download native apps to devices such as the iPhone. Those practices have drawn criticism and formal legal complaints from some developers. The Coalition for App Fairness, structured as a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. and Brussels, said it plans to advocate legal changes that would force Apple to change. Beyond Epic, Match and Spotify, other members include smaller firms such as Basecamp, Blix, Blockchain.com, Deezer, and Tile, along with developers from Europe including the European Publishers Council, News Media Europe and Protonmail. Epic is suing Apple over antitrust claims in a U.S. federal court in California, while Spotify has filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union. Sarah Maxwell, a representative for the group, declined to comment on how much funding the Coalition for App Fairness has raised and from whom. Apple declined to comment but on Thursday unveiled a new section of its website explaining the benefits of its approach, saying it had blocked 150,000 apps last year for privacy violations. It says App Store fees fund the creation of developer resources such as 160,000 technical documents and sample code to help developers build apps. Mike Sax, founder of The App Association, a group sponsored by Apple, said in statement that the new coalition’s “big brands do not speak for the thousands of app makers that are the foundation of the app economy.”",Business
Oil steady as market eyes coronavirus hit to demand," TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Friday but on track for a weekly fall on concerns that a global resurgence of COVID-19 infections will constrain fuel demand, while the likely return of exports from Libya will add to supply. Brent crude LCOc1 was down 2 cents at $41.92 a barrel by 0113 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 3 cents firmer at $40.34. Brent is heading for a drop of nearly 3% this week, while U.S. crude is on track for a decline of almost 2%. Both benchmarks are also on track for a monthly decline, which would be the first for Brent in six months. “The prospect of the return of Libyan barrels to the market is adding to the bearish sentiment,” RBC Capital Markets said in a note. “However, we think the return of the barrels will be slow and subject to reversal based on the volatile security and political picture.” An oil tanker was loading a cargo on Thursday from one of three Libyan terminals that were reopened in recent days and more cargoes are expected to be lifted in the coming days. Beyond that “crude prices will have difficulty rallying, on a structural basis, unless refining margins lead the path higher,” RBC said. In the United States, which has the highest death toll from the COVID-19 crisis and is the world’s biggest oil consumer, unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week suggesting an economic recovery is flailing and pushing down fuel demand. U.S. crude, gasoline and distillate inventories all fell last week, according to government data on Wednesday. Still, U.S. fuel demand remains in the doldrums as the pandemic constrains travel. The four-week average gasoline demand last week was 9% below a year earlier, government data showed earlier in the week. In other parts of the world, daily increases of coronavirus infections are hitting records and new restrictions are being put in place that will likely limit demand for travel and fuel.",Business
Crude steady as rising European COVID-19 cases offset U.S. oil stock draw," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were steady on Thursday as a new wave of coronavirus cases in Europe led several countries to reimpose travel restrictions, offsetting a bullish drop in U.S. crude and fuel inventories. Brent futures LCOc1 settled 17 cents, or 0.4%, higher at $41.94 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 38 cents, or 1.0%, to end at $40.31. That cut Brent's premium over WTI WTCLc1-LCOc1 to its smallest closing level since late May when WTI settled higher than Brent on one day. “Oil prices (are) stable for now but downside pressure remains ... due to rising COVID numbers across Europe,” said Craig Erlam, senior analysts at OANDA. Britain, Germany and France imposed new restrictions to stem the coronavirus spread - all factors affecting fuel demand. Prices were also capped by data showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week, supporting views the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was running out of steam amid diminishing government funding. ""Oil prices are holding up pretty well despite the lack of additional U.S. government stimulus,"" Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said, noting the market received support from this week's U.S. oil inventory data and a rise in the stock market. .DJI.SPX U.S. crude, gasoline and distillate inventories all fell last week, according to government data on Wednesday. [EIA/S] U.S. fuel demand, however, remains subdued as the pandemic limits travel. The four-week average gasoline demand last week was down 9% from a year earlier, government data showed. Looking forward, a senior executive at U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips COP.N said global demand will return to 100 million barrels per day and grow from there. On the supply side, the market remains wary of a resumption of exports from Libya, although it is unclear how quickly it can ramp up volumes. An oil tanker was loading a crude cargo on Thursday from one of three recently reopened Libyan terminals, with more loadings expected over the coming days.",Business
"Dollar off two-month peak, yuan gains on bond benchmark inclusion"," TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped from a two-month peak early on Friday as renewed hopes of U.S. stimulus eased investors’ concerns about economic recovery, while the Chinese yuan gained after the country was added to a global bond benchmark. The dollar index edged down to 94.313 =USD, after scaling a two-month high of 94.601 in Thursday's U.S session amid a bout of risk aversion. Currencies and stocks reversed direction, with U.S. equities gaining as traders latched on to hopes that stalled stimulus talks could resume between House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week. The move came after the latest data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week in a sign the economic recovery was running out of steam. Many market players were cautious, however, as there remain doubts over whether the U.S. can overcome divisions to agree on a package. U.S. political uncertainties are also keeping many investors on edge，with a disputed election becoming more likely after U.S. President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost the election. “We have seen lately the dollar gaining as risk assets are sold off. We need to see whether this will continue beyond the end of this month,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Rises in U.S. real yields have also underpinned the dollar. The yield on 10-year U.S. inflation-protected Treasuries rose to minus 0.911% US10YTIP=RR, the highest since late July. The euro changed hands at $1.1671 EUR= after having hit a two-month low of $1.16265 on Thursday. The dollar was little moved at 105.41 yen JPY=, having risen to 105.53, its strongest level in a over week, on Thursday. The British pound managed to stay above Wednesday’s two-month lows after Britain’s government launched scaled-back job support for workers hit by a resurgent COVID-19 pandemic. The offshore yuan gained, stemming its decline over the past week or so, after FTSE Russell announced it will add Chinese government bonds to its flagship World Government Bond Index (WGBI) starting in 2021. “Foreign ownership of Chinese government bonds has picked up steadily. The inclusion in the WGBI benchmark will prompt additional foreign flows into the Chinese bond market and support the yuan,” said Kevin Xie, China economist at the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney. The Australian dollar traded at $0.7056 AUD=D4, having hit a two-month low of $0.7016 overnight. The Turkish lira maintained its firm tone following a jump from Thursday’s record low after the country’s central bank unexpectedly hiked interest rates by 200 basis points. The lira last stood at 7.6200 per dollar TRYTOM=D4, more than 1% above its record low of 7.7170 set on Thursday.",Business
"Electrified by Tesla, Chinese startups are on the charge"," BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s electric vehicle startups are on the charge again, thanks to Tesla. The country’s growing fascination with the U.S. pioneer’s sleek designs and cutting-edge technology is giving a string of second-wave home-grown Tesla wannabes the traction to raise more funding, expand production and boost sales. Chinese EV startups NIO, XPeng Inc, Li Auto and WM Motor have raised more than $8 billion between them this year and now rival Aiways is planning to go public, its co-founder and President Fu Qiang told Reuters. Speaking ahead of the Beijing auto show which starts on Saturday, Fu said the relative success of U.S. initial public offerings (IPO) by XPeng and Li Auto had helped fuel the company’s ambitions to list. Since it was founded in 2017 in Shanghai, Aiways has raised “no more than 10 billion yuan” and it will need to secure more funding from some private equity funds and other investors, said Fu, the former head of Volvo Cars China who has also been an executive at Mercedes-Benz, Skoda and FAW-Volkswagen. “IPO is also in our plans, and we’re planning to push ahead with it,” Fu said, adding that Aiways would most likely be listed within China, declining to elaborate further. China has been the world’s fastest-growing EV market for years helped by generous state purchase subsidies but the sales boom started to sputter last year as Beijing began cutting back financial support and watering down other pro-EV policies. Some prominent Chinese EV startups such as Byton and Singulato have struggled and NIO’s future looked in doubt last year. But a surge in Tesla’s market value - and its sales in China - suggest the country’s EV dream is far from over. “As Tesla stock goes, so goes the fate for electric vehicle startups,” said China auto expert Mike Dunne. “Funds are flowing like a river in spring again. Tesla could end up pulling everyone into the future sooner than expected.” ‘JUST OUT OF THE GATE’ Tesla’s sales in China in the first eight months of 2020 have nearly tripled from a year ago to 73,658 cars, according to consulting firm LMC Automotive, despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Chinese auto executives say cars made by the company from Palo Alto, California are achieving the status of Apple’s first iPhones in China and with so many potential technological advances still to come, that gives them hope. Fu believes the revived interest in EVs in China is partly because EV owners are fascinated by intelligent driving functions, as well as the interactive, so-called connected services that many newer models are starting to come with. “Today’s smart, connected cars aren’t that smart. We’re just out of the gate and are in a stage that could be described as iPhone 1 or the original iPhone,” Aiways President Fu said. “As that gets developed step-by-step, in the near future we will get to iPhone 8, iPhone 9 and iPhone 10.” Dunne, too, said Tesla was the primary factor sustaining interest in EVs among consumers and investors in China, and elsewhere in the world. Tesla’s shares have surged 10-fold over the past 12 months and it became the world’s most valuable car company in July. And cheaper running costs are also a significant factor. Cui Yihua, who sells aquariums in the eastern city of Suzhou, Jiangsu province, switched from his gas-guzzling Audi Q7 to save cash and chose an electric-blue Aiways U5 sports-utility vehicle (SUV) after also test-driving a Tesla Model 3, saying he liked the U5’s interior design, its colour and extra space. “I have charging facilities in my housing compound, in the parking garage downstairs. I put a 100-yuan deposit down for charging and I’ve been using it for two weeks,” he said. “It’s negligible compared to gasoline-fueled cars.” Automakers in China that were part of the initial wave of EV startups sold or leased many of their cars to drivers working for ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and rival taxi services who were spurred on by rebates and other policy support for EVs. Now, Fu and NIO co-founder and Chief Executive William Li believe China’s EV marketplace is driven more by private car owners and their pure interest in electric cars. That’s most evident in the performance of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan, which is perceived by many consumers as fairly affordable at about 270,000 yuan ($39,750) after purchase subsidies. Credit also goes to Wuling, a General Motors Co joint venture, whose Hongguang Mini EV has become China’s best-selling electric car this year, in part because its cheapest model sells for just 28,800 yuan. To be sure, some companies hit hard by the initial slowdown in EV sales are still in limbo. Byton has suspended its business for six months through January and is working on a restructuring of its operations, a spokeswoman said. Singulato, meanwhile, is operating on a limited capacity and is looking for further funding to finish developing two cars and launch them, a senior company source told Reuters. But executives say raising funds has become markedly easier this year, and their confidence levels are climbing too. NIO, for example, has raised $3.8 billion this year to get back on track, mostly through state-affiliated funds in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, and also with commercial paper and additional shares, its spokesman said. WM Motor, backed by China’s most widely used internet search engine Baidu, raised $1.5 billion this week. XPeng Inc and Li Auto raised $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion respectively through U.S. listings in July and August. ‘DEMAND IS REALLY STRONG’ While sales of what China defines as new energy vehicles (NEV) - all-electric cars, plug-in electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles - started to contract more than a year ago, they jumped 26% in August after a 19.3% rise in July, which ended 12 months of year-on-year declines. LMC Automotive expects sales of passenger NEVs to fall 8.9% this year but surge 48.4% in 2021 to hit 1.52 million vehicles, or 7% of expected passenger car sales. LMC’s Shanghai-based analyst Alan Kang expects NEV sales to accelerate mainly because Beijing recently enacted tougher green-car quotas for carmakers. Fu said sales of the Aiways U5, its first model, have gained momentum since April to surpass 1,400 in the three months through August, when it also unveiled its sportier SUV U6 ion. Within a year, he thinks Aiways could reach sales of 10,000 cars in China, with another 3,000 from Europe, where it has started selling in Germany. It plans to expend into Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. In NIO’s case, sales of its ES8 and ES6 models zoomed to 10,331 vehicles in the second quarter, half of its 2019 sales and almost matching sales of 11,348 for all of 2018, when only its seven-seater ES8 SUV was on offer. NIO’s overall gross margin turned positive in the second quarter and hit 9.7% for vehicle sales. Operating losses shrank nearly 65% from a year earlier to 1.1 billion yuan. “We think we have decisively overcome the difficulties of last year,” Chief Executive Li, who says he still flies economy to save the company money, told Reuters. “Demand is really strong. If you place an order with us right now you will need to wait for a really long time to pick up your new car,” Li said. “Our main challenge in the fourth quarter is to improve our production capability.”",Business
"Facebook suspends fake Russian accounts, warns of U.S. election hack-and-leak threat"," LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Thursday it has dismantled three networks of fake accounts which could be used by Russia’s intelligence services to leak hacked documents as part of efforts to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election. The company said the accounts, which it suspended for using fake identities and other types of “coordinated inauthentic behaviour,” were linked to Russian intelligence and people associated with a St. Petersburg-based organisation accused by U.S. officials of working to sway the 2016 presidential vote. The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment after normal working hours in Moscow. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling and says it does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, said there was no immediate evidence that hacked documents were about to be leaked, but by suspending the accounts Facebook hoped to prevent them being used in any subsequent operation. “Our team watches for the threats and trends that we need to be ready for, and one that we are very aware of ... is a hack-and-leak operation, particularly in the next 6-8 weeks,” he told Reuters. “We want to make sure that the accounts are down to prevent their ability to pivot them to facilitate a hack-and-leak around the U.S. election.” Facebook said the networks were small with only a handful of accounts on its website and photo-sharing service Instagram, some of which posed as independent media outlets and think tanks. The accounts had a combined total of around 97,000 followers. While some of the activity did target audiences in Britain and the United States, the networks were predominantly focused on countries in the Middle East and bordering Russia, such as Syria, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, Facebook said. Twitter Inc said it had worked with Facebook to identify and remove 350 accounts operated by state-linked organisations in Russia. Both companies said one of the networks had been identified following a tip from the FBI, which warned on Tuesday that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to spread disinformation about the results of the Nov. 3 election. The warnings follow an alert by Microsoft Corp earlier this month that hackers linked to Russia, China, and Iran are trying to spy on people tied to both U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, worked with Facebook to analyse the suspended accounts. He said the activity showed Russia was continuing efforts to exacerbate political tensions in the United States and elsewhere. “That doesn’t dismiss the fact that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than what any foreign adversary could do,” he said. “But Russia’s efforts remain an extremely serious national security vulnerability.”",Business
Stocks fall despite Wall St stimulus hope; dollar dips," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose in a choppy session on Thursday on hopes of more economic stimulus but the gains were not enough to lift an index of stocks across the globe, while the dollar ticked down from two-month highs. The Federal Reserve this week has talked up the importance of more fiscal stimulus amid investor fears of another economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic. Weak labor market data on Thursday underscored that need. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week, a lawmaker said on Thursday, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated that she is ready to negotiate with the White House. Even so, Wall Street’s largest companies, some of which have outperformed at a time of increased economic uncertainty, took the lead in pushing indexes higher. The tech sector was the most influential within the S&P 500. “Investors are going to be needing stocks that can weather a lower growth path because if we don’t get another round of fiscal stimulus, there’s not going to be a lot more we can do to continue boosting the economic recovery,” said Max Gokhman, capital markets strategist at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 52.31 points, or 0.2%, to 26,815.44, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.67 points, or 0.30%, to 3,246.59 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 39.28 points, or 0.37%, to 10,672.27.

U.S. Treasury yields dipped, caught between the downbeat economic data, U.S. election uncertainty and the rise in stocks. “People want to sell the market because of what is going to take place in the election, then there are those who need to buy yield and any time the market backs up they are right in there,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York. “That is why we are in a very tight trading range at this point.” Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 3/32 in price to yield 0.6659%, from 0.676% late on Wednesday.

India's August crude processing drops as raging virus cases dim demand," (Reuters) - Crude oil processed by Indian refiners slipped 26.4% from a year ago in August, the most in four months, as fuel demand remained subdued on skyrocketing coronavirus cases that hindered industrial and transport activity. Indian refiners processed 3.82 million barrels per day (bpd) or 16.15 million tonnes of crude last month, 8.7% lower than in July, government data released on Thursday showed. Crude oil throughput in August recorded its largest year-on-year contraction since April, when it posted its steepest decline since 2003. Weaker refining margins and a slide in fuel consumption have prompted refiners to cut crude processing and lower output. Fuel demand posted its biggest monthly decline since April last month, as a surge in coronavirus infections continued to throttle economic activity and transportation. [O/INDIA2] India has been consistently reporting the world’s highest daily tallies of infections and its 5.7 million coronavirus cases only trail the United States. “We have pared back our expectations for the pace of consumption recovery in India due to a largely unabated spread of the virus there,” Barclays Commodities Research said in a note earlier this week. “Virus trends in India have been the most concerning recently, but government restrictions have been slowly easing even there... recovery is likely to be much slower compared to the initial rebound and will likely come through in waves.” Indian refiners operated at about 76.1% of their overall capacity in August compared to 83.3% in July, the data showed. Top refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC) IOC.NS operated its directly owned plants at 66.7% capacity, as per the data. The refiner expects local gasoline and gasoil demand to reach pre-pandemic levels in the first half of fiscal 2021 and sought to expand its petrochemical capacity to off-set weaker fuel refining margins. Reliance, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, operated its plants at about 75.8% capacity.",Business
U.S. labor market slowing as fiscal stimulus fades," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week, supporting views the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was running out of steam amid diminishing government funding. The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy’s health, also showed 26 million people were on unemployment benefits in early September. The faltering labor market recovery and a recent rise in new coronavirus infections has piled pressure on Congress and the White House to come up with another rescue package. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the U.S. central bank needed to “stay with it” in working to support the economy’s recovery. More fiscal stimulus is looking increasingly unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election. “The high level of joblessness shows that the country isn’t out of the woods yet and it won’t be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn’t heard by government officials down in Washington,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “The economy is running on empty.” Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 870,000 for the week ended Sept. 19. Data for the prior week was revised to show 6,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 840,000 applications in the latest week. Unadjusted claims increased 28,527 to 824,542 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted claims number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis. Six months after the pandemic started in the United States, jobless claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though applications have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March. While the reopening of businesses in May boosted activity, demand in the vast services industries has remained lackluster, keeping layoffs elevated. Job cuts have also spread to industries such as financial services and technology that were not initially impacted by the mandated business closures in mid-March because of insufficient demand. A total 630,080 applications were received for the government-funded pandemic unemployment assistance last week. The PUA is for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs. Altogether, 1.5 million people filed claims last week. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 167,000 to 12.58 million in the week ending Sept. 12. Economists believed the so-called continuing claims are declining as people exhaust their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to 26 weeks in most states. Indeed, just under one million workers exhausted their first six months of state unemployment benefits in August. At least 1.6 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 5, up 104,479 from the prior week. The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for September’s unemployment rate. The decline in mid-September implied a further decrease in the unemployment rate from 8.4% in August. “Only faster progress against the virus itself will assuage the unemployment struggles of so many workers in fields like entertainment who can’t return to their jobs until social distancing restrictions are relaxed ,” said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. The Fed has cut interest rates to near zero and vowed to keep borrowing costs low for a while, and has also been pumping money into the economy. Government money to help businesses has virtually dried up. Tens of thousands of airline workers are facing layoffs or furloughs next month. A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, whose funding is already running out. The death toll from COVID-19 in the country topped 200,000 on Tuesday, the highest number of any nation. The ebbing fiscal stimulus is already restraining the economy after activity rebounded sharply over the summer. Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 32% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947. But retail sales and production at factories moderated in August. Business activity cooled in September, reports have shown. Goldman Sachs on Wednesday cut its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3% rate from a 6% pace, citing “lack of further fiscal support.”",Business
Government to hold H2 borrowing for now; RBI support key: analysts," MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian government is unlikely to increase its second half borrowing when it announces its full-year target this month, but will leave room for any hike towards the end of the fiscal year in March if needed, economists and market participants said. The federal government has already borrowed more than half of the planned full year borrowing of a record 12 trillion rupees ($162.36 billion) in the fiscal first half that runs through September, and the government is likely to finish borrowing the rest by January, economists said. “Given the highly uncertain outlook on the fiscal math, H2 borrowings might be completed by early 2021, with any larger-than-expected revenue shortfalls to be plugged thereafter by additional issuance,” said Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS. The majority of the 10 market participants and economists interviewed by Reuters agreed with this view, saying any hike in borrowing at this stage could cause a spike in bond yields as expectations of another increase later would rise. “If government does increase the borrowing programme then RBI is likely to step up its open market operations (OMOs) to bring down yields,” said Sameer Narang, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. The central bank has mostly stuck to conducting special OMOs, such as the simultaneous buying and selling of bonds similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s “Operation Twist”, and rejected all bids at its first outright OMO on Thursday, leaving market participants puzzled. The RBI allowed banks to prematurely repay the money borrowed via long-term repo operations conducted earlier in the year, pulling out more than a trillion rupees from the system, giving it more room to conduct OMOs, traders said. The government has also borrowed a significantly higher amount through short-term treasury bills in the first half, which will be due for maturity in the next six months, increasing pressure on government finances. Revenue collections too have been muted as the nationwide lockdown at the start of the fiscal year meant several industries were non-operational. Coronavirus cases have continued to climb as the country opens up for business. India has the world’s second highest number of infections, and economists have also argued the need for another round for fiscal stimulus for the economy, that is expected to contract by around 10% in the current year.

UK watchdog tells banks to improve remote working safeguards," LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and investment firms need more “creative solutions” to avoid misconduct as staff are set to work from home for longer due to the pandemic, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday. Britain told people to work from home if possible from Thursday as new cases of COVID-19 grow again, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying the new restrictions could stay for up to six months. Banking employees such as traders began working from home after a lockdown was introduced in March but had started returning to the office in recent weeks, where they can be more closely supervised by compliance staff. Megan Butler, executive director for wholesale supervision at the FCA, said firms have broadly managed conduct and other risks from remote working “pretty well so far”. “These are all difficult questions that get harder over time as it looks like no-one is going to be back in the office anytime soon,” she told the FCA’s annual meeting. “Industry has coped pretty well so far and we are now going to be looking to them to find perhaps some more creative, resilient solutions to these issues than perhaps some of the ones that have worked so well so far.” Most organisations are realising that lots of controls, oversight and cultural practices are built on pre-existing relationships, she said. “The longer working from home goes on, the more they are at risk of breaking down. The more new people come in, who you don’t know, you don’t know whether to trust or not, it’s in those areas where I think there is still more to do,” Butler said. She is also surveying firms that the FCA regulates to assess how close they are to collapsing due to the coronavirus. The FCA has surveyed 14,000 firms, with another 10,000 being asked shortly. Hundreds of firms could be at risk, a number that was expected to grow, Butler said.",Business
Samsung signs up Verizon as first customer for indoor 5G gear," STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics has signed up Verizon as its first customer in the United States for its 5G products to increase indoor coverage, weeks after winning a $6.64 billion order for telecom equipment from the mobile network operator. A small player until recently in the telecom equipment business, Samsung has gained ground in recent years and is challenging the dominance of Nokia and Ericsson in telecom gear. It has also benefited from China’s Huawei [HWT.UL] getting barred from bidding for 5G contracts in the United States. Samsung’s new 5G portfolio will help operators add coverage and capacity indoors, be it homes of users or factories and warehouses, Alok Shah, Vice President of Network Strategy at Samsung, told Reuters. He said the company was in talks with other U.S. telecoms operators. Indoor coverage is crucial for 5G as the millimetre wave radio frequency used by the likes of Verizon faces problems in passing through walls or other obstacles. Samsung had a 3% market share of the total global telecoms equipment market in 2019, behind No. 1 Huawei with 28%, Nokia’s 16%, Ericsson’s 14%, ZTE’s 10% and Cisco’s 7%, according to market research firm Dell’Oro Group. The South Korean company is positioning itself between the traditional suppliers and the ones like Mavenir and Altiostar, which are using software to run network functions on the cloud dubbed Open Radio Access Network (RAN), reducing the use of physical equipment. Larger suppliers are more protective of their current market share and smaller players who are pushing the envelope on technology don’t have the skill at this time. Samsung sits right in the middle, Shah said. “We have scale that we can bring to bear, but we’re also a challenger and we’re very hungry and aggressive,” Shah said. “So far that’s really been the secret sauce for us to bring both sides of that coin to customers.”",Business
EU launches investigation into Chinese optical fibre cable imports," BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission launched an investigation on Thursday into imports of optical fibre cable from China, which EU manufacturers believe are being sold in Europe at artificially low prices. The case comes as the 27-member European Union wants the digital economy to be a key part of its economic recovery and demands a greater opening of Chinese markets. Europacable, which brought the complaint on behalf of the EU producers, said some 1.2 million kilometres (745,000 miles) were sold in Europe last year, with 15-20% coming from China, in a total EU market worth about 1 billion euros ($1.16 billion). Chinese imports rose by 150% from 2016 to 2019, the industry group said. EU anti-dumping investigations take up to 15 months, but provisional duties can be put in place within eight. Final tariffs, if imposed, would normally apply for five years. The largest producers in the EU are Italy’s Prysmian Group, U.S. company Corning and France-based Nexans and Acome. Major Chinese optical fibre cable makers include Yangtze Optical FC, Hengtong Group, Fiberhome and Futong. The Commission has already carried out a series of investigations into glass fibre products from China and imposed tariffs. It also has 29 ongoing trade defence investigations, 18 of them including products from China.",Business
RBI rejects all bids at first open market bond buy this year," MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday rejected all the bids it received at its first outright open market purchase of bonds for this fiscal year, puzzling traders and investors. The RBI had planned to buy up to 100 billion rupees ($1.35 billion) worth of six-year to 11-year papers at an open market operation. But despite receiving bids worth 664.73 billion rupees in total, it did not accept any of them. “The RBI seems unhappy with the bids offered. If the market is in stress as (traders) say they are due to the high supply, (the market) should be selling at reasonable levels,” a senior trader at a private bank said. “It is possible that RBI, which is also buying in the secondary market, feels that they can get better results there”. The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to a session high of 6.03% after the OMO results were announced but ended the day steady at 5.99%. The central bank extended market trading hours by a total of two hours, which traders said reassured the market and suggested the RBI will buy bonds in the secondary market despite rejecting the bids at the OMO. Several traders had been hopeful of more OMOs to help cope with the government’s record market borrowing of 12 trillion rupees this fiscal year, which could go up further if tax revenues remain muted and the government fails to raise funds from other avenues like divestments. After Thursday’s failed auction however, the RBI announced another round of simultaneous purchase and sale of bonds worth 100 billion rupees each on Oct. 1, similar to the U.S. Fed-style ‘Operation Twist’, continuing with its practise thus far. “The RBI seems to suggest that they don’t want to add to market liquidity. Market will take it negatively,” said A. Prasanna, an economist with ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. ($1 = 73.8932 Indian rupees)",Business

Harley deepens restructuring with India exit," (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc said on Thursday it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India, effectively abandoning the world’s biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold. Harley had spent recent months moving dealerships in the country to cheaper locations, and the announcement followed speculation in Indian media a month ago that executives had played down. The move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, some 70 redundancies and the closure of its Bawal plant, walking away from a market worth about 17 million bike and scooter sales a year. (bit.ly/3mPHZnx) It will retain only a scaled-down sales office in Gurgaon, south of New Delhi. The departure is also the latest setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s strategy to encourage domestic manufacturing that would keep more of the fruits of a gigantic home consumer market in India. Harley has been scrambling for years to grow sales beyond baby boomers in the United States and has not posted retail sales growth there in the past 14 quarters. Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who took the reins at the company in February, unveiled a major “Rewire” in July to boost profits by reducing Harley’s product portfolio by 30% and investing in 50 markets with growth potential in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific. India was one of the markets the company at that point committed to investing in more heavily. Thursday’s statement said the move to leave had been pushed through since Aug. 6. Harley said it now expects total restructuring costs of about $169 million in 2020, but warned that the restructuring program - referred to internally as “The Rewire” - was likely to incur more charges. India, still far cheaper and poorer than many of the developing economies with which it competes for investment, has proven an inhospitable market for other auto industry players. Last year, Ford Motor Co pared back its interests and ceased independent operations in India by entering into a joint venture with Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra. General Motors, which stopped domestic sales in 2017, also plans to stop manufacturing and exports from India by the end of this year. Growth in domestic sales has slowed of late - with sales of cars and motorbikes falling 18% in the last fiscal year to March 31 from a year ago.",Business
ONGC douses fire; gas supplies to industries hit," NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD (Reuters) - A fire at an Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plant caused by a pipeline rupture has cut gas supplies to customers including power and fertiliser companies, gas marketing firm GAIL (India) Ltd said on Thursday. The fire broke out on Thursday morning at ONGC’s Hazira gas processing plant in western Gujarat state and has since been extinguished, ONGC said, adding that there were no casualties. The plant, which produces liquefied petroleum gas and other products such as naphtha, has been closed but ONGC said it is working to resume normal operations. GAIL, India’s biggest gas marketing firm, supplies the bulk of gas produced at ONGC’s western offshore fields to customers in the states of Gujarat, Goa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It supplies about 60 million standard cubic metres of gas daily to these customers. In a statement, GAIL said ONGC had shut off the supply of 30 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of gas to GAIL’s north-western pipeline network to contain any further damage. “Supply cuts of up to 40% against current allocations have been imposed on downstream customers,” it said, adding that supplies to households had not been disrupted and the pipeline grid, which supports about 80 mmscmd of gas, had not been damaged. India’s biggest utility NTPC Ltd shut its 656 megawatt gas-based power plant at Kawas near Hazira and a 657 megawatt Jhanor-Gandhar plant due to gas supply disruption, a person at the company said. Capacity utilisation at fertiliser maker KRIBHCO fell to 50% and Jadish Prasad Verma, general manger for production at the company’s Hazira plant, said they were trying to secure gas from other local suppliers. Gas supplies to customers have temporarily closed due to safety reasons, an ONGC spokesman said. “There could be some impact on our production... We are investigating the cause of fire, and extent of damage.” NTPC did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comments. Surat Collector and District Magistrate Dhaval Patel, a senior city official, told Reuters the fire was caused by a rupture in a pipeline at the gas terminal. ONGC’s plant is in Surat, a city in Gujarat. “The area was cordoned off, depressurised and cooled as part of firefighting measures,” Patel said. Surat Municipal Commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said the fire was in the 36-inch Uran-Mumbai gas pipeline.",Business
Exclusive: Top Toshiba investor calls for inquiry in widening votes scandal," TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp’s top investor has called for an investigation of a botched meeting in July at which it says several shareholders were deprived of their vote, a letter to the Japanese conglomerate’s board seen by Reuters shows. What began as a problem at Toshiba has widened into a larger scandal for corporate Japan, with the bank hired to count the votes, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, and Mizuho Trust, revealing details of counting errors at more than 1,300 firms. Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, which owns around 10% of Toshiba, is the latest investor to join the outcry over the meeting, which has drawn attention to concerns about governance and treatment of foreign shareholders. Effissimo and Toshiba both declined to comment on Thursday. The letter from Effissimo comes after Toshiba this month said more than 1,000 postal voting forms for its July 31 meeting went uncounted. Another Singapore-based fund, 3D Investment Partners, has already called for an investigation, saying its vote had not been fully recognised. Effissimo said in its letter, which was dated Sept. 23., that Toshiba’s board should establish a committee made up exclusively of independent members to investigate whether the July meeting was conducted fairly. “We have surveyed several dozen shareholders regarding this matter, and were able to confirm that there are in fact several shareholders that were unable to vote in a manner consistent with their intentions,” Effissimo said. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, which was entrusted with counting the shareholder mail-in votes for the Toshiba meeting, said on Thursday it had found 3.4 million uncounted shareholder votes at 975 client firms. The trust banking arm of Mizuho Financial Group said it had found 22,848 voting forms were uncounted at 371 shareholder meetings where it had been involved in a joint venture with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. Although both banks said the uncounted votes would not have impacted the outcome of any shareholder meetings, the scale of the miscounting is likely to concern investors. The 1,346 companies at which vote-counting problems were found were almost all listed companies, the banks said, or roughly one-third of listed companies in Japan. “We deeply apologise for the mishandling of the vote counting,” said Atsushi Kaibara, a senior official at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, as he and another executive bowed in front of reporters at a news conference. The bank attributed the miscounts to procedures during the peak season for shareholder meetings. To get more time to count the forms, it usually asks the post office to deliver them a day earlier, it has said. But it would not issue receipts until the day after forms were delivered, meaning that some were mistaken for being past the deadline even though they were delivered on time, it said. The procedure has been used for a “significantly long time,” Kaibara said, adding the bank was now doing away with it.",Business
"India's ShareChat raises $40 million from investors including Twitter, Lightspeed"," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian content-sharing platform ShareChat has raised $40 million from investors including Twitter Inc and Lightspeed Ventures as it seeks to boost usage of its new short-video app, the company said on Thursday. The fund raising comes as Indian apps like ShareChat seek to tap more users after New Delhi banned dozens of Chinese origin apps including ByteDance’s TikTok following a border clash between the two countries in June. Reuters last month also reported ShareChat is in talks with investors including U.S.-based Sequoia Capital to raise another $200 million, which could value the company at over $1 billion. JPMorgan is advising on that fund raising. The latest funds will be used to drive growth for ShareChat’s short-video app Moj, the company said in a statement, a platform which is similar to TikTok. ShareChat’s existing investors Twitter, Lightspeed Ventures and SAIF Partners were involved in the current fund raising, the statement said. Two new Indian investors also participated, including Pawan Munjal, the chairman of India’s biggest motorbike manufacturer Hero MotoCorp. “Large parts of the fund have been earmarked for doubling down on investments made towards (Moj’s) product development ... and establishing partnerships with music labels,” ShareChat said. ShareChat and Moj together have more than 240 million monthly active users. ShareChat allows users to post content in 15 Indian languages, while Moj allows sharing of short videos. After India banned TikTok, ShareChat and other home-grown alternatives have been finding favour with users. Facebook’s Instagram has also introduced a new video sharing feature called “Reels” in the country.",Business
Wells Fargo CEO sorry for 'insensitive comment' on diversity," (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf has apologized for making insensitive remarks around race and diversity, seeking to quell a row over his references to a shortage of talent among minority groups. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Scharf had exasperated some Black employees in a Zoom meeting this summer when he reiterated that the bank had trouble reaching diversity goals because there were not enough qualified minority candidates. He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody. “There are many talented diverse individuals working at Wells Fargo and throughout the financial services industry and I never meant to imply otherwise,” Scharf said in a statement on Wednesday. “Across the industry, we have not done enough to improve diversity, especially at senior leadership levels.” The remarks on a shortage of candidates were widely criticized by politicians and business leaders after the Reuters report was published on Tuesday. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the most prominent Wells Fargo critics, said the bank’s problem begin with its leadership. “Its CEO has an unfathomable blind spot about how and why this giant bank fails to hire, promote, and fairly compensate Black talent – and continues to be a core part of a financial system that scams Black families disproportionately and fuels structural racism in our economy and our society,” she said in a statement. “Perhaps it’s the CEO of Wells Fargo who lacks the talent to recruit Black workers,” U.S. Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. Scharf listed a handful of appointments the bank has made recently as evidence of its commitment to diversity and went on to lay out details of the steps it was taking to recruit more from minorities. As the head of the largest U.S. bank by number of employees, he has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals. He has also told hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant and to ensure diversity on interview teams. “Anyone who’s open to re-evaluating their position, their perspective and taking into consideration a new set of facts, you have to give him the benefit of the doubt,” said Teri McClure, a former executive with United Parcel Service Inc who had been among those criticizing Scharf on Tuesday. “The Wells Fargo team should use that as an opportunity to move forward,” she added. Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens as head of operations and Ather Williams as head of strategy, digital and innovation. “There is no question Wells Fargo has to make meaningful progress to increase diverse representation,” Scharf said on Wednesday.",Business
Uber's Mideast business Careem sees speedier-than-expected recovery," DUBAI (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc-owned Middle East business Careem is seeing its ride service recover more quickly than expected from the coronavirus crisis, while its delivery business is larger than before the pandemic. Careem, which mainly operates in the Middle East, had originally forecast that its ride service would recover at the end of 2021, but now expects it to rebound earlier in the year with some markets already close to pre-COVID levels. “We are seeing a strong recovery in the rides business and we are seeing a pretty significant acceleration in the deliveries business,” Careem CEO Mudassir Sheikha told Reuters. “The delivery business is significantly larger than what it was pre-COVID and continues to grow quite strongly, double digit month on month,” he said. Careem, which says it has 1.7 million drivers in 13 countries, has said it has been encouraged by a better than expected pickup in demand as coronavirus restrictions ease. Uber bought Careem last year for $3.1 billion. Its businesses include ride hailing services and delivery, which includes take-away food, and third-party bill payment services. Dubai-headquartered Careem on Thursday told staff who do not need to be in the office to work remotely on a permanent basis. The pandemic had been a “forced pilot” for remote working, during which business performance and employee productivity had increased, Sheikha said. Careem employs more than 1,300 office staff in 14 different countries, including 500 employees in Dubai. The company expects to save 20-30% of real estate costs as it downsizes its offices, and Sheikha said he hoped the remote working policy will make Careem a more attractive employer and allow the company to hire people from around the world. Careem is focused on growing in existing markets, rather than expanding into new countries, Sheikha said.",Business
Electric vehicle charging network ChargePoint to go public at $2.4 billion valuation," DETROIT (Reuters) - ChargePoint Inc, one of the world’s oldest and largest electric vehicle charging networks, said on Thursday it will go public by merging with Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp in a deal that values the company at $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close near the end of the year and the company will be named ChargePoint Holdings Inc. A trading symbol on the New York Stock Exchange has not been identified. Reuters last week reported ChargePoint and Switchback were nearing a deal. Switchback is a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $300 million in an initial public offering in July 2019. “The EV charging industry is accelerating and it is expected that charging infrastructure investment will be $190 billion by 2030,” Switchback Chief Executive Scott McNeill said. “We believe (ChargePoint) will continue to grow its strong market position as the EV industry evolves.” The deal will raise about $493 million in proceeds that ChargePoint will use to expand in North America and Europe. It includes $225 million from Baillie Gifford, Neuberger Berman Alternatives Advisors and other institutional investors. Baillie Gifford is one of the largest shareholders in EV segment leader Tesla Inc. “Being ready to be public means that you’re investing in scaling the platforms you already have because this addressable market is very, very large,” ChargePoint Chief Executive Pasquale Romano, who will continue to lead the company after the deal closes, told Reuters. A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating entity, typically within two years. SPACs have emerged as a quick route to the stock market for companies, particularly auto technology startups, and have proven popular with investors seeking to echo Tesla’s high stock valuation. Other EV companies with SPAC deals include Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Canoo. Electric and fuel cell vehicle startup Nikola, which has been called a fraud by a short seller and seen its founder resign, is another. Prior to the SPAC deal, ChargePoint, which operates but does not own its charging network, had raised more than $660 million. The Campbell, California-based company, founded in 2007, has attracted funding from both private venture investors and large strategic investors, including Daimler, BMW, Siemens AG and U.S. energy firms Chevron Corp and American Electric Power Co Inc. ChargePoint operates more than 115,000 charging ports globally, mostly in North America, and previously said it is aiming to increase that to 2.5 million by 2025. ChargePoint’s revenue was $147 million last year and the company said if the North American auto industry’s penetration rate for EVs hits 3% from 1.9% now, it would represent a revenue opportunity of $1 billion. It expects to hit profitability in 2022 or 2023.",Business
AstraZeneca still waiting for FDA go-ahead to resume U.S. trial," FRANKFURT (Reuters) - AstraZeneca AZN.L is still waiting for the U.S. drug regulator to approve the restart of the clinical trial of its potential COVID-19 vaccine in the United States almost three weeks after it was paused due to safety concerns. The U.S. trial of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, initially developed by the University of Oxford, remains on hold while regulators investigate an illness in one of the participants, even after a British study and other programmes outside of the United States have resumed. “We are the sponsor of the U.S. study. We then provided all this information to the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and we are waiting to hear their decision,” Soriot told a virtual World Economic Forum discussion. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Wednesday the continued suspension showed the FDA was taking vaccine safety seriously. A document posted online by Oxford university last week stated the illness in a British participant that triggered the pause on Sept. 6 may not have been associated with the vaccine. Asked why the company had not disclosed details about the nature of the illness, Soriot said clinical trial regulators and independent supervisors were guarding participants’ privacy. Still, the company would look into increasing transparency without compromising individual rights and while also preventing the public and volunteers from drawing wrong conclusions, which could endanger trial enrollment. “We are discussing with other companies as an industry what information we can offer without compromising patient privacy but also without compromising the trial itself,” said the CEO. Soriot also said that tests of the vaccine prototype on children had not started yet. The British trial (here), launched in May seeking more than 12,000 volunteers, will have one out of 11 subgroups with children 5 to 12 years of age.",Business
Iraqi oil ministry denies deal to up oil exports," CAIRO (Reuters) - Iraq’s oil ministry on Thursday denied a media report citing Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar as saying an agreement was imminent with the OPEC+ group to increase Iraq’s crude oil exports. State news agency INA had quoted Abdul Jabbar as telling state-owned daily newspaper al-Sabah that he expected to reach an agreement soon with OPEC and its allies - known as OPEC+ - over increasing Iraq’s crude oil exports “The oil minister did not make these comments and did not meet the newspaper’s reporter,” oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad told Reuters. The INA article has since been deleted. “Iraq is committed to the OPEC+ agreement and is working with OPEC and non-OPEC producers on confronting the challenges facing global oil markets, including the spread of COVID-19 which caused a decline in global oil demand,” Jihad said. OPEC’s second-biggest producer, Iraq has failed in the past to fully comply with OPEC+ oil output reductions, pumping above its production targets since the pact was first signed in 2016 between OPEC and its allies led by Russia. The reduction in exports resulting from the OPEC+ cuts has squeezed Iraq’s finances, challenging a government struggling to tackle the fallout from years of war and rampant corruption. Iraq relies on oil to fund 97% of its state budget. Iraq’s economy and oil sector were battered by years of wars, sanctions and a stubborn Islamist insurgency triggered by the U.S. invasion. Baghdad has complained it struggled to revive its stagnating oil industry, at a time when other OPEC members benefited and boosted their market share. Iraq’s total exports averaged 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, down from 2.763 bpd in July. OPEC+ has been reducing production since January 2017 to help to support prices and reduce global oil stockpiles. It increased the cuts to a record 9.7 million bpd from May to July after demand plunged due to the coronavirus crisis.",Business
'We're a tech company': Russia's Sberbank bets big on strategy shift," MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank, Russia’s dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech. The company, which is dropping the word “bank” from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday. Sberbank’s Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching “SmartMarket”, an equivalent to Apple’s AppStore or Google Play. “It’s a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it’s a huge investment,” he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount. The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country’s oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion. In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia’s digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the “largest transformation” in its history. “We’ve always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,” Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products. Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms. Among Sberbank’s new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition. Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple’s Siri, Hey Google or Amazon’s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank’s devices and mobile apps. What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are “cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,” Sberbank said. The company’s SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money. “It’s strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,” said Rafalovsky. The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date. Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country. Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft’s LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks. However Sberbank’s costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market. Apple, Samsung and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru, internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market. In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia’s answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition. While Sberbank’s diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets. BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire. Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said. “How do you earn money if you do banking business only?” she added.",Business
Russia to supply 17 more countries with COVID-19 drug Avifavir," MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and its partner Chemrar will supply the COVID-19 drug Avifavir to 17 additional countries, the fund said in a statement on Thursday. Avifavir gained approval from the Russian health ministry in May and is based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used there as the basis for viral treatments. Clinical trials in Japan and Russia have confirmed those drugs’ efficacy, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in a statement.",Business

Mitsubishi UFJ Lease to buy Hitachi Capital in deal worth $2.8 billion," TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Lease said on Thursday it would buy smaller rival Hitachi Capital Corp in a deal calculated at 294 billion yen ($2.8 billion). The two companies formed a capital alliance in 2016 and had been negotiating a merger since, they said in a joint statement. The deal would help the new company, to be set up in April, to compete with global competitors, they said. Mitsubishi UFJ Lease would give 571 million shares to shareholders of Hitachi Capital, making the deal worth about 294 billion yen based on Mitsubishi UFJ Lease’s closing price of 515 yen on Thursday. Hitachi Capital has a market value of 319 billion yen based on Thursday’s close. The two companies will have assets worth about 10 trillion yen and almost 10,000 employees, they said. Their combined revenue will be around 1.4 trillion yen ($13.3 billion), a Reuters calculation showed. Japanese business magazine Diamond reported the transaction earlier on Thursday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in both companies’ shares following the report. ($1 = 105.3100 yen)",Business

TikTok asks judge to block U.S. from barring app for download," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - TikTok asked a U.S. judge on Wednesday to block a Trump administration order that would require Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to remove the short video-sharing app for new downloads starting on Sunday. A federal judge in San Francisco on Saturday issued a preliminary injunction blocking a similar Commerce Department order from taking effect on Sunday on Tencent Holdings’ WeChat app. U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns that the personal data of as many as 100 million Americans that use the app was being passed on to China’s Communist Party government. On Saturday, the Commerce Department announced a one-week delay in the TikTok order, citing “recent positive developments” in talks over the fate of its U.S. operations. TikTok said the restrictions “were not motivated by a genuine national security concern, but rather by political considerations relating to the upcoming general election.” TikTok said if the order is not blocked “hundreds of millions of Americans who have not yet downloaded TikTok will be shut out of this large and diverse online community - six weeks before a national election.” TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, said on Monday it will own 80% of TikTok Global, a newly created U.S. company that will own most of the app’s operations worldwide. ByteDance added that TikTok Global will become its subsidiary. Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5% and 7.5%, respectively. On Monday, Oracle said ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok would be distributed to ByteDance’s investors, and that the Beijing-based firm would have no stake in TikTok Global. On Saturday, ByteDance, Walmart and Oracle said they reached an agreement that would to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States after President Donald Trump said he had blessed the deal. Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to relinquish ownership of TikTok.",Business
JPMorgan set to pay nearly $1 billion in spoofing penalty - source," (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is set to pay nearly $1 billion (£786 million) to resolve market manipulation investigations by U.S. authorities into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. The large fine would lift a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and mark a signature victory for the government’s efforts to clamp down on illegal trading techniques, such as spoofing, especially in the precious metals markets. JPMorgan has said in public filings here that it was in discussions with authorities about resolving the investigations. The settlement with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could come as soon as this week and is not expected to result in any restrictions on the bank’s business, the person said. The SEC declined to comment. The CFTC and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg News. JPMorgan shares fell about 1.6% on Wednesday, less than the declines by other major banks. Spoofing is a practice in which traders place orders they intend to cancel to move prices to benefit their market positions. The Justice Department has taken aim at the practice in recent years, using sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential wrongdoing that it could not previously detect. Reuters has reported that around 2017, the agency began using techniques it originally developed to spot healthcare fraud schemes to identify suspicious trading patterns, including by scanning activity on exchanges. “The idea was: let’s mine this data source to see who the worst actors are,” Robert Zink, a top Justice official who helped lead the effort, told Reuters in May.

World Bank's IFC adopts new climate rules to deter lenders from backing coal," LONDON (Reuters) - The World Bank’s private-sector arm has introduced new climate change conditions for its investments in commercial banks to encourage the lenders to wind down support for coal projects in Africa and Asia. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), which owns equity stakes in many large commercial banks in emerging markets, hopes the restrictions will trigger other investors to exit the coal sector. “I think this is an important milestone. If we look historically, our environmental policies and procedures have been adopted by both other development finance institutions and the market in general,” Peter Cashion, head of climate finance in the IFC’s Financial Institutions Group, told Reuters. Under the new rules, in effect since July last year but published on Sept. 17, the IFC will no longer make equity investments in financial institutions that do not have a plan to phase out support for coal. The IFC will also use various conditions attached to its existing and new equity investments to ensure that the banks involved reduce their exposure to coal to zero by 2030. The IFC exerts considerable influence over commercial banks in emerging markets, which often turn to the Washington-based lender for both access to capital and the kind of governance expertise that helps them build credibility among investors. Apart from the IFC’s being a major investor in its own right, its standards are widely adopted by the private sector. Climate change campaigners welcomed the move, saying it sent a clear message to the commercial banking and insurance sectors that public finances would no longer be made available for institutions backing coal projects. “We expect an avalanche of different institutions to adopt a similar approach, it will have a huge impact,” Nezir Sinani, co-director of Recourse, a Netherlands-based nonprofit organisation which has been lobbying the IFC, told Reuters.",Business
Gilead to pay $97 million to settle U.S. kickback probe," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc has agreed to pay $97 million to resolve U.S. government claims it used a purportedly independent charity to pay illegal kickbacks to cover Medicare patients’ out-of-pocket costs for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Letairis. The U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday the settlement resolves allegations that Gilead improperly used the Caring Voice Coalition as a conduit to cover thousands of patients’ co-payment obligations. Gilead’s actions enabled the Foster City, California-based drugmaker to boost revenue, ran from June 2007 to December 2010, and violated the federal False Claims Act, the department said. That law prohibits drugmakers from offering anything of value to induce Medicare patients to buy their drugs. “Gilead used data from CVC that it knew it should not have, and effectively set up a proprietary fund within CVC to cover the co-pays of just its own drug,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said in a statement. He said such conduct undermines Medicare’s co-pay structure, which Congress meant to prevent against inflated drug prices. Drugmakers cannot subsidize co-payments for older Americans enrolled in Medicare, but may donate to independent non-profits that provide such assistance. In a statement, Gilead said it addressed concerns raised by the government, and does not believe it violated the law. It also said there was no allegation that patients who received medication did not need it. Gilead’s settlement resulted from an industrywide probe led by Lelling’s office into drugmakers’ support for so-called patient assistance charities. Eleven drug companies including Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc and United Therapeutics Corp have reached more than $1 billion of settlements with the government. Four foundations and a pharmacy have also settled.",Business
IMF official warns coronavirus will weigh on some economies for years," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis is lasting longer than expected and it will take some countries years to return to growth, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. The Fund has provided some $90 billion in total financing to 79 countries, including 20 in Latin America, since the start of the health crisis, an IMF spokeswoman said. It is continuing to work with member countries on how to contain the pandemic and mitigate its economic impact, First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey Okamoto told an online event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “We’re trying to preserve our financial firepower,” Okamoto said. “We’re talking about a ... return to growth that’s going to take a few years, and many countries along the way that are probably going to need assistance.” Latin American and Caribbean economies are the hardest hit in the world by the pandemic, reporting around 8.4 million coronavirus cases, and more than 314,000 deaths, both figures being the highest of any region. Okamoto told the event that Fund officials were in talks with the Group of 20 major economies about extending a temporary halt in official bilateral debt service payments by low-income countries under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), and how to kickstart private sector participation. The G20 initiative approved in April expires at the end of the year, but experts and government officials in many countries have backed extending it into 2021, with a decision expected in coming weeks and months. The issue could come up when finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies meet online on Friday. In August, the ministers agreed to consider extending the DSSI. United Nations officials and others have urged the G20 to expand their efforts to include middle-income countries and island nations hit by the collapse of tourism. The issue of debt sustainability was “top of mind” for Fund officials, Okamoto said, noting that many countries in Latin America had debt distress before coronavirus, which had exacerbated those pressures. The DSSI is giving the IMF more time to assess the full debt picture for these countries, he said. “It’s lasting longer than we anticipated, and so that is going to change a bit the dynamics of what we think is sustainable in the long run.” He said the Fund was continuing to ask rich countries to fund two specific Fund programs that lend to poor countries. The United States, the largest shareholder in the IMF, has signalled it hopes to contribute, but no funds have been provided for those programs so far.",Business
"Factbox: Tesla could struggle to implement some of its battery advances, experts say"," (Reuters) - The advanced battery cell design and new manufacturing processes outlined by Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk are promising, battery experts say, but they questioned how quickly they can be implemented and how much they’ll contribute to reducing overall costs. Tesla’s new battery cell — a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make — is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030. “We’re not getting into the cell business just for the hell of it, it’s because it’s the fundamental constraint” to eventually producing 20 million vehicles a year, Musk said on Tuesday in a “Battery Day” presentation that disappointed investors. Following are comments from battery experts on Musk’s plans: Gene Berdichevsky, CEO and co-founder of battery materials manufacturer Sila Nanotechnologies and a former Tesla battery systems architect: “The most concrete, most tangible and maybe the most impactful thing is the new cell design. That’s a really good design, leading to lower manufacturing costs at the cell level. The hardest thing ever isn’t making it (the cell), the hardest thing is manufacturing it at scale.” Shirley Meng, a professor at the University of California San Diego: “Most of the claims were expected, like the 4680 format, the tabless design, the silicon anode, the diversified cathode choices. I was caught by surprise by the cathode manufacturing process and the new aluminum-based alloys.” Gary Koenig, an associate professor at the University of Virginia: “It seems like often people are looking for a new type of battery, but changing things like form factor can make a big difference, and a lot of the Battery Day discussion mentioned those advances. Making processing easier and faster, and even successfully making the (battery) wider or electrodes thicker, can make relatively big improvements at the larger pack level.” “As Musk mentioned, battery electrode processing involves adding and later removing solvent, so it seems intuitively like there should be a way to cut out that step. The solvent addition really helps to blend the multiple desired components, so getting good adhesion and mixing without the solvent I expect to be challenging.”",Business
"Oil-trading bribery probe widens with new U.S. charges, guilty pleas"," RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors charged a former U.S. employee of a Swiss energy trading firm with bribery and a Florida company pleaded guilty to bribery as a probe into corruption in energy trading widened in the United States. Authorities in the United States and Brazil are investigating improper payments to officials at Petrobras, Brazil’s state-run oil company, as part of Brazil’s far-reaching corruption probe, known as Car Wash. The latest U.S. court filings shed new light on the role of energy traders in a scheme that has led to charges against hundreds of powerful business leaders and politicians. Petrobras said it has been collaborating with authorities since 2014 and was a victim of the schemes. Javier Aguilar, a former Vitol Group manager based in Houston, was charged on Tuesday with conspiracy and money laundering involving a $870,000 bribe to Ecuadorian government officials in order to win a $300 million oil contract. It marked the first indictment of an employee of a top commodities trading house in the probe. Aguilar, through his attorney, denied the allegations. The U.S. investigation mirrors efforts in Brazil, where prosecutors are also investigating people connected to trading houses Vitol, Glencore GLEN.L and Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], according to Brazilian court documents. The U.S. Department of Justice involvement was spurred by the involvement of U.S. banks in the alleged payments. Aguilar was Vitol’s chief negotiator for the oil contract, according to a person familiar with the matter. Aguilar set up contracts with intermediaries in the United States to win the deal, the DOJ said in a release. Vitol said it was aware of the U.S. charges and is cooperating with authorities. The company has anti-bribery and corruption policies and controls in place, a spokeswoman said. Trafigura said it has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption. “Any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,” Trafigura said. Glencore declined to comment. Luiz Eduardo Andrade, a Brazilian consultant, separately pleaded guilty to acting as a go-between to win contracts with Brazil's Petrobras, according to a DOJ statement here. Andrade did not reply to requests for comment. Sargeant Marine, a Florida company that once operated a joint venture with Vitol, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to working with Andrade and others to bribe officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela to win contracts for asphalt, an oil-byproduct. The firm will pay a $16.6 million fine, the DOJ said. Sargeant Marine and Daniel Sargeant, the company’s top executive, declined to comment through their attorneys. Andrade and former Petrobras oil trader Rodrigo Berkowitz were arrested in the United States in December 2018 as part of Brazil’s Car Wash investigations. They have been cooperating with the DOJ and Brazil prosecutors in parallel investigations targeting the oil trading houses, according to two people close to the matter in Brazil. Brazilian prosecutors said at the early stages of the investigation in 2018 that the details being made public were just the “tip of the iceberg” of an international corruption scheme in which trading firms would bribe foreign officials to win contracts. Petrobras this year lifted a ban imposed in 2018 on dealings with traders Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura.",Business
"Fed policymakers vow to keep interest rates near zero, call for more fiscal help"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday doubled down on efforts to convince investors they will keep monetary policy easy for years to allow unemployment to fall, emphasizing that interest rates will stay near zero until inflation gets to 2% and stays there. The Fed’s governing board made that vow last week at its regularly scheduled policy meeting, promising to leave rates at their current near-zero levels until the economy reaches full employment, inflation has risen to 2%, and is on track to moderately exceed that level. Both Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans were adamant on Wednesday: Rates will not increase until labor markets recover fully from the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus, and prices hit the Fed’s target. “Rates will be at the current level, which is basically zero, until actual observed PCE inflation has reached 2%,” Clarida told Bloomberg Television, referring to the Fed’s preferred measure of prices. “That’s ‘at least.’ We could actually keep rates at this level beyond that,” Clarida said. “But we are not even going to begin thinking about lifting off, we expect, until we actually get observed inflation ... equal to 2%.” How much of an overshoot beyond that would be tolerable is an “academic” discussion until the economy rebounds, Clarida said. Evans for his part was not timid. “I don’t fear 2.5% inflation” he said, noting that the lower the tolerance for an inflation overshoot, the longer it will take for the Fed to meet its goal of 2% inflation on average. Regardless, he said, the Fed won’t raise rates until inflation reaches 2%, sustainably, and the central bank is confident it will overshoot that goal - conditions that won’t be met before the end of 2023. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said it may take longer for the central bank to hit that target if infections rise in the fall and winter, leading to slower growth. “We’d be lucky to get 2% inflation within” four years, Rosengren said during a virtual forum organized by the Boston Economic Club. Investors were disappointed the Fed did not back up its new pledge by increasing its bond purchases, however, and sent stocks lower on Wall Street’s major indices. Ramping up the Fed’s bond purchases from their currently monthly pace of $120 billion or otherwise beefing up asset purchases would be premature until the economy gets into better shape, Evans told reporters on a call. That could include unemployment closer to 6% than the 8.4% it is now, and more consumers feeling comfortable spending their money outside of the home. When that happens, “we would have a better idea of the right amount of accommodation and the way to deliver it,” Evans told reporters. “At the moment everybody understands that we are accommodative.” The Fed cut rates to near zero in March and took other steps to combat a recession that took hold as businesses shut down and consumers stayed home to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Despite some recovery from the economic downturn, “there is a long way to go,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress, with millions still jobless compared to where the economy was in February. “We need to stay with it ... The recovery will go faster if there is support coming both from Congress and the Fed.” Several policymakers said that further government aid from Congress is needed, with Clarida emphasizing that the U.S. economy could return from the current “deep hole” of joblessness and weak demand in perhaps three years. “It would have been fine if the pandemic lasted three months, but the pandemic isn’t lasting three months,” Rosengren said in an interview with Reuters. “It’s lasting much longer than that and so there’s definitely a need for more targeted spending.”",Business
"Corporate groups cheer, investors cry foul as U.S. tightens shareholder rights rules"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted 3-2 on Wednesday to make it tougher for shareholders to push companies on issues such as climate change, social justice and diversity, with Democratic commissioners dissenting against the move. The rule, first proposed by the SEC last November, raises the bar for submitting shareholder proposals to companies’ annual ballots and increases the proportion of the vote a proposal must win before it can be resubmitted. The SEC and corporate lobby groups have said the decades-old rules need to be modernized to stop niche issues clogging up corporate ballots - a risk that SEC chair Jay Clayton said on Wednesday could impose “significant” costs on companies and other shareholders. But the changes sparked blowback from many investors, lawmakers, and the SEC’s own Democratic commissioners, who warned it would kill proposals on climate change, racial justice, and the COVID-19 pandemic just as corporate America should be confronting these problems. “These issues are material to performance and shareholders ... Today’s rule amendments unnecessarily interfere with, and may chill, the live debate over these issues,” said Caroline Crenshaw, the agency’s new Democratic commissioner. Previously, an investor had to hold at least $2,000 of a company’s stock for one year to file a proposal - a threshold the SEC raised to three years on Wednesday. It also raised the proportion of the vote a proposal must win in order to be resubmitted to the ballot year-on-year. However, the agency scrapped a highly contentious provision that would have allowed companies to exclude proposals that received falling levels of support, as first reported by Reuters. The SEC felt that change was “not necessary,” an official said. Amy Borrus, executive director at the Council of Institutional Investors, a major investor group which fought the changes, said they would weaken investor voices and result in fewer shareholder proposals. “And that is precisely the goal of the business lobby that pressed the SEC to make these changes. Simply put, CEOs and corporate directors do not like being second-guessed by shareholders,” she said. Corporate groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have pushed to rein in shareholder proposals and on Wednesday cheered the changes. The Chamber said they would help prevent “special interest activists” from pushing “narrow agendas unrelated to the success of public companies.” SEC officials said most of the proposals come from a small group of repeat filers. “While we all have a right to get on our soapboxes, we have no right to force others to pay for them,” said Republican Commissioner Elad Roisman, who spearheaded the rule change. Earlier this year, the SEC also imposed stricter rules on firms which advise investors how to vote in corporate elections, a change also backed by corporate lobbyists and panned by investor groups. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said Wednesday’s change was a “slap in the face to corporate accountability.”",Business
California sets goal to ban sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles starting in 2035," WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035 as the top U.S. auto market shifts to electric vehicles to reduce climate-warming emissions, Governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday. The move is the most significant yet by a U.S. state aimed at ending the use of fossil fuel-burning internal combustion engines, and clashes with the pro-fossil fuel policies of President Donald Trump’s White House. Newsom declared earlier this month he would step up the state’s already aggressive efforts to combat climate change amid a record wildfire season. “We are marking a new course,” the Democratic governor told a news conference in Sacramento while standing in front of electric cars produced by automakers that support California’s efforts to reduce vehicle emissions. Newsom signed his executive order on the hood of a prototype red electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. The country’s most-populous state is committing to a “firm goal” to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035 and was encouraging other states to take similar action, Newsom said. California has a broader goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, but in recent years transportation-sector emissions have increased. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) will turn Newsom’s goal into a legally binding requirement by writing regulations to mandate that 100% of in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks are zero-emission by 2035. The board also plans to mandate by 2045 that all operations of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles be zero-emission where feasible. California accounts for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, and many states choose to adopt its green vehicle mandates. Newsom characterized the move as an economic opportunity that would create jobs and boost U.S. auto manufacturers. “If you are an American manufacturer, how can you compete globally unless you are in that business? Unless you are pushing the boundaries of innovation?” he said. Trump has sought to bar California from requiring the sale of electric vehicles, while Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden has pledged to spend billions to speed their adoption. ‘WON’T STAND FOR IT’ In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere called the move “alarming” and said it would destroy jobs and raise consumer costs. “President Trump won’t stand for it,” he said. The Republican president’s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the measure was “very extreme” and he did not see others taking similar action. “I don’t think we should be taking any steps to get rid of fossil fuels, he told a White House briefing, “and by the way, there should be consumer choice for all automobiles.” Biden spokesman Matt Hill said electric vehicles could “create a million good-paying union jobs, dominate a fast-growing market worldwide, and meet the demands of the climate crisis.” But he added that Biden “thinks of it in terms of incentives and investments, not bans.” California said it was joining 15 countries that have made similar pledges, including Britain. California’s clean vehicle goals have not always come to pass and in some cases have been pushed back or reworked. Newsom’s executive order sets a “goal” of no gasoline-powered passenger vehicles after 2035 and does not prevent Californians from owning gasoline-powered cars or selling them on the used car market. Environmental groups praised the governor’s action on clean vehicles, but automakers were skeptical. A group representing major automakers including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG said “neither mandates nor bans build successful markets.” It noted that electrified vehicles accounted for less than 10% of new-vehicle sales in California, which is still the best in the United States. Newsom also said he wanted the state legislature to ban new permits allowing use of hydraulic fracturing technology for oil and gas drilling by 2024. Environmental groups had hoped he would ban all new drilling permits in the state. California and nearly two dozen other U.S. states have sued the Trump administration, which has rolled back Obama-era vehicle emissions standards and sought to undo California’s authority to set strict car pollution rules. If the Trump administration order that seeks to bar California from requiring a rising number of electric vehicles is upheld, legal experts say it would prevent the 2035 mandate. The administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter California’s efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles.",Business
Some in BOJ warned pandemic could delay Japan's recovery - July minutes," TOKYO (Reuters) - Some Bank of Japan board members warned a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic could delay an economic recovery and destabilise its banking system by pushing more companies under, minutes from the bank’s July rate review showed on Thursday. While they agreed on the need to ramp up stimulus if needed, the BOJ policymakers said the hit to financial institutions’ profits from the pandemic could erode their ability to boost lend, the minutes showed. “Infection numbers are increasing at a faster pace globally, so we need to be on alert of the possibility of a re-insurgence including in Japan,” a few members were quoted as saying. “If infection numbers rise again, the timing of an economic recovery will be delayed,” one of them said. The damage from the pandemic, if prolonged, could lead to job losses, hurt household income and cool consumption, another said. While the BOJ kept policy steady at the July rate review, the remarks underscore a lack of confidence the board members had over their projections of a modest economic recovery. “Members agreed if financial institutions’ profits remain under pressure for a prolonged period, that could undermine financial intermediation,” the minutes showed. Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and 10-year bond yields around zero to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target. It eased policy twice so far this year to cushion the blow from COVID-19 such as by expanding asset buying and creating a lending facility aimed at easing corporate funding strains. A few members said the BOJ should continue to focus on easing funding strains, and shift its attention toward efforts to hit its price goal only when the pandemic is contained, the minutes showed. But others called for more creativity. “We need to look more deeply into what monetary policy should look like in a world where society must co-exist with the pandemic,” one member said.",Business
U.S. Justice Department proposes changes to internet platforms' immunity," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump met with nine Republican state attorneys general on Wednesday to discuss the fate of a legal immunity for internet companies after the Justice Department unveiled a legislative proposal aimed at reforming the same law. Trump met with attorneys general from Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. Also Wednesday, the Justice Department, which is probing Google for potential breaches of antitrust law, held a call with state attorneys general’s offices to preview a complaint to be filed against the search and advertising giant, perhaps as soon as next week, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It is normal for the department to seek support from state attorneys general when it files big lawsuits. Critics have accused Google, owned by Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, of breaking antitrust law by abusing its dominance of online advertising and its Android smartphone operating system as well as favoring its own businesses in search. The Justice Department is expected to wait at least another week before filing the lawsuit as states review its case and decide whether to join, people familiar with the matter said. The White House said the legal immunity discussion involved how the attorneys general can utilize existing legal recourses at the state level - in an effort to weaken the law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability over content posted by users. After the meeting, Trump told reporters he expects to come to a conclusion on the issue of technology platforms within a short period. It was not immediately clear what conclusion he was referring to. He said his administration is watching the performance of tech platforms in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election. “In recent years, a small group of powerful technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,” Trump said. “Every year countless Americans are banned, blacklisted and silenced through arbitrary or malicious enforcement of ever-shifting rules,” he added. Trump, who himself frequently posts on Twitter TWTR.N, said Twitter routinely restricts expressions of conservative views. Earlier on Wednesday, the Justice Department unveiled a legislative proposal to reform Section 230. It followed through on Trump’s bid earlier this year to crack down on tech giants after Twitter Inc placed warning labels on some of Trump’s tweets, saying they have included potentially misleading information about mail-in voting. The Justice Department’s proposal would need congressional approval, and is not likely to see action until next year at the earliest. Unless the Republicans win control of the House of Representatives and maintain control of the Senate in the November elections, any bill would need Democratic support. The Justice Department proposal primarily states that when internet companies “willfully distribute illegal material or moderate content in bad faith, Section 230 should not shield them from the consequences of their actions.” It proposes a series of reforms to ensure internet companies are transparent about their decisions when removing content and when they should be held responsible for speech they modify. It also revises existing definitions of Section 230 with more concrete language that offers more guidance to users and courts. It also incentivizes online platforms to address illicit content and pushes for more clarity on federal civil enforcement actions. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement the administration was urging “Congress to make these necessary reforms to Section 230 and begin to hold online platforms accountable both when they unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate egregious criminal activity online.” The Internet Association, which represents major internet companies including Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Google, said the Justice Department's proposal would severely limit people’s ability to express themselves and have a safe experience online. The group’s deputy general counsel, Elizabeth Banker, said moderation efforts that remove misinformation, platform manipulation and cyberbullying would all result in lawsuits under the proposal.",Business
ByteDance applies for tech export licence in China amid TikTok deal talks," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - ByteDance has applied for a tech export licence in China as it races to seal a deal with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc that it hopes will end U.S. government plans to ban its TikTok video-streaming app on security grounds. The Beijing-based firm submitted the application to Beijing’s municipal commerce bureau and is awaiting a decision, it said on its Toutiao online news platform on Thursday, without referring to ongoing talks over its U.S. operations. The application comes about a month after China revised its list of technologies subject to export bans or restrictions for the first time in 12 years, in a manner which experts said gave the government a say over any TikTok deal. It can take up to 30 days to obtain preliminary approval to export such technology. Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters on Thursday that the application has been received and would be handled in accordance with relevant regulations and procedures. ByteDance has said its deal with Oracle and Walmart will see the creation of a standalone U.S. company and does not involve any transfer of technology, though Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok U.S. source code. It has also said the deal needs approval from both China and the United States. However, the companies have issued conflicting statements over the terms of the agreement they reached with the White House. ByteDance said it will establish a U.S. subsidiary called TikTok Global of which it will own 80%. Oracle and WalMart, however, said majority ownership of TikTok Global would be in American hands, complying with an Aug. 14 executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump that ByteDance relinquish ownership of TikTok within 90 days. Chinese state media outlets China Daily and the Global Times this week said they see no reason for China to approve the deal that Oracle and Walmart said they have struck with ByteDance, calling it based on “bullying and extortion”. TikTok’s experience is “a textbook example of the United States’ modern-day piracy and tech bullying,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua said in an English-language commentary on Thursday, adding that national security concerns that Washington has expressed over TikTok are “nothing but a fig leaf”. “It is time that other countries saw through the outrageous farce of the TikTok drama, knew what is really at stake, and joined hands to oppose such blatant robberies and maintain a fair global business environment,” it said. TikTok asked a U.S. judge on Wednesday to block an order from Trump’s administration that would require Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to remove its short video-sharing app for new downloads from Sunday. In response to a question on TikTok’s request, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Thursday said China supports companies’ use of relevant legal weapons to uphold their rights.",Business
"Dollar shines as virus, economy woes hit risk assets"," TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains against most currencies on Thursday as signs of economic slowdown in Europe and the United States renewed concern about a second wave of coronavirus infections. The euro, which has already taken a hit due to worries about a return to severe lockdown restrictions, faces an additional hurdle later on Thursday with the release of data on German business sentiment. The dollar is likely to continue to rise as another spike in coronavirus cases and the Federal Reserve’s warnings that the U.S. economy needs more fiscal stimulus cause investors to repatriate funds from riskier assets. “Risk is being sold across the board, and there is a big unwinding of dollar shorts,” said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities. “Questions surrounding the coronavirus and the need for even more stimulus are turning flows back to the dollar.” The dollar traded at $1.1658 per euro EUR=D3 on Thursday in Asia, just shy of a two-month low high reached on Wednesday. The pound GBP=D3 bought $1.2714, near its weakest level since late July. The dollar was quoted at 0.9240 Swiss franc CHF=EBS, which is near a nine-week high. The U.S. currency bought 105.40 yen JPY=D3, holding onto a 0.4% gain from the previous session. The dollar has rallied this week as rising coronavirus infections in Europe and Britain undermined investor optimism about vaccine progress. The Ifo survey due later on Thursday is forecast to show an improvement in business morale in Germany, Europe’s largest economy. However, sentiment for the euro has already suffered a big blow after surveys released on Wednesday showed new restrictions to quell a resurgence in coronavirus infections slammed the euro zone’s services industry into reverse. The mood for riskier assets has also soured after data on Wednesday showed U.S. business activity slowed in September and several Fed policymakers warned that further government aid is needed to bolster the economy. The dollar index =USD, which pits the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, stood at 94.336 on Thursday, close to a nine-week high. There are no major economic data releases scheduled during the Asian session, so trading could be subdued, analysts said. Some investors are watching the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which have come under pressure due to growing expectations for additional monetary easing. A recent decline in commodity prices is expected to increase downside risks for the Antipodean currencies, some traders say. The Aussie AUD=D3 traded at $0.7069, near its weakest since July 21. Across the Tasman Sea, the kiwi NZD=D3 bought $0.6549 after tumbling by 1.3% in the previous session.",Business
Wall Street closes lower on fears of a slowing economy," (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes fell sharply on Wednesday after data showing a cooling of U.S. business activity and the stalemate in Congress over more fiscal stimulus heightened concerns about the economy while the coronavirus pandemic remains unchecked. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell more than 2%, and all 11 of the major S&P sectors closed lower. Energy .SPNY - already the worst-performing sector this year - led the rout in its biggest single-day decline since July 9.[O/R] Hopes of a strong recovery and historic stimulus fueled the U.S. stock rally following the coronavirus-driven crash in March. But doubts over another relief bill and a sell-off in heavyweight technology-related stocks have weighed on sentiment since the market peaked on Sept. 2. Wednesday’s plunge came six months to the day that U.S. stocks on March 23 tumbled to their lowest point during the pandemic-induced selloff. The economy is now leveling off at about 80% of activity before the pandemic and won’t get back to normal until a vaccine is in place, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia. “We’re at that phase where it’s harder to get that next bit of the recovery, that next bit of the reopening in place,” Pride said. “We’re still doing it, but the progress is way slower than it was in the first three months of the reopening.” Investors are struggling to understand where to invest with mega-cap tech stocks trading well above their long-term fair value, but the deep-value stocks represent maturing industries, such as energy and brick-and-mortar banks, he said. “We’re spending more of our time in that sweet spot in the middle to get away from the extremes of growth,” Pride said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank was not planning any “major” changes to its Main Street Lending Program, while saying that both the Fed and Congress need to “stay with it” in working to bolster the economic recovery.[nW1N2FN01K] “The longer we go without more stimulus, the harder it will be to sustain the gains in the economy,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. Data from IHS Markit showed gains at factories were offset by a slowdown in the broader services sector in September, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy at a time when concerns are rising about a potential surge in COVID-19 cases heading into the colder months. Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled a legislative proposal, which would need congressional approval, that seeks to reform a legal immunity for internet companies and follows through on President Donald Trump’s bid from earlier this year to crack down on tech giants. Wall Street favorites including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, which have borne the brunt of recent losses, again declined at a rate exceeding losses of the benchmark S&P 500. A decline in Facebook Inc FB.O came in below the S&P drop. The S&P 500 skidded to lows last seen in late July and is now down 9.6% from its record high hit three weeks ago. That puts it less than half a percentage point from entering corrective territory, as the Nasdaq did last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 525.05 points, or 1.92%, to 26,763.13. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 78.65 points, or 2.37%, to 3,236.92, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 330.65 points, or 3.02%, to 10,632.99. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.04 billion shares, up from 8.68 billion shares on Tuesday. Tesla Inc TSLA.O, another recent Wall Street darling, tumbled 10.3% after Chief Executive Elon Musk failed to impress with his promise to cut electric vehicle costs at the company's much-awaited ""Battery Day"" event on Tuesday. Nike Inc NKE.N surged 8.8% to a record high after it reported that quarterly digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset a fall in sales at traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 7.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.95-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 89 new lows.",Business
China's slow consumption recovery upset by wary low-income households," BEIJING (Reuters) - Months after China brought its coronavirus epidemic under control, its consumers are slowly opening their wallets again - but the hard days of lockdowns still weigh on many shellshocked lower-income households, who prefer to hold on to their cash. While China's recovery here from a record first quarter contraction is well ahead of most other countries, it has been uneven. Lingering weakness in consumption could complicate President Xi Jinping's push to curb the country's dependence on volatile overseas markets. Factories rebounded relatively quickly from paralysing lockdowns, but consumer confidence has picked up only gradually in the world’s second-largest economy. It took until August before retail sales finally returned to growth, rising 0.5% on-year. Sales for the first eight months were 8.6% lower than the same period last year. But while spending on luxury goods like Prada bags 1913.HK quickly shook off the virus shock, consumption of daily necessities and services is recovering more slowly. Extra caution from lower-income households is a key reason why, say analysts. “We live on savings but it’s difficult, we tried to buy only the necessities,” said Zhou Ran, a self-employed decorator in central Henan’s Xinxiang city who couldn’t work for four months earlier this year amid lockdowns. Sales of clothing and shoes remain down 15% over the first eight months, while fuel and other petroleum product sales are down 17.3%. Incomes from food and beverage sales fell over 26% in this period. Analysts will be closely watching data and company sales reports from China’s “Golden Week” holidays on Oct. 1-8 to gauge how quickly consumers’ mood is improving. Though Zhou returned to work in May, business was hard to find. “Many people prefer to keep cash for now so they delay renovations,” he said. “It is difficult for everyone this year,” said Zhou, whose wife takes care of their three children and doesn’t have an income. A quarterly report issued jointly by the research arm of Alibaba-backed Ant Group and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics showed the vulnerability of low income families to the epidemic. Most households with annual incomes below 100,000 yuan ($14,800) reported their wealth declined in the first and second quarters. Those with incomes above 300,000 yuan reported consistent gains. “Higher-income households have probably built up savings, because of the forced reduction in consumption during lockdown, and could now be ready for a spending spree,” said Wei He, an analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, in a note. “It is lower-income households that face a longer slog of normalizing their finances,” he said. JD.com data shows that consumption growth in lower-tier cities and low-income groups was weaker than in major cities and high-income groups in June, reversing the usual trend, according to Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits, the Chinese e-commerce giant’s fintech arm. This is likely because the small and medium-sized enterprises which employ many lower-income people were affected more by the epidemic, Shen said in an article published August. The impact on consumption could be considerable. Some 600 million Chinese people earn a monthly income of barely 1,000 yuan, according to Premier Li Keqiang, speaking in May. That would be over 40% of the country’s population. Beijing has issued a slew of policies to stabilize jobs and support spending over the last months. Local authorities and companies have, for instance, handed out billions of yuan in shopping vouchers. To be sure, China’s recovery, as imbalanced as it is, is still a bright spot in global consumption as other major economies battle a second wave of infections and in some cases impose fresh curbs on activity. Many in China’s vast export-oriented sector have turned to the domestic market as foreign orders dry up, with enthusiastic government support. An app from Alibaba Holding Group Ltd which helps manufacturing suppliers sell directly to domestic consumers has seen 1.2 million companies sign up since its launch in March. Nearly half were export-focused previously, according to an Alibaba spokesperson. Domestic orders now make up 40% of total orders for Tu Xinye, the manager of a company that makes toothbrushes in southern Jiangsu province. That’s up from just 10% in the past, and overall sales volume has returned to 90% of pre-COVID levels, he said. But while Chinese consumers made up for the company’s shrinking overseas orders this year, they also create new challenges, said Tu. Competition is fiercer at home than in the bigger “blue ocean” export market, and Chinese buyers also like different kinds of toothbrushes - with softer bristles and smaller handles. Tu’s company’s relative success has been an outlier in his town. Many smaller companies there have collapsed, and Tu is now in the process of acquiring a competitor. “Times of crisis are also times when there’s some economic reshuffling,” he said.",Business
How a marked-up term sheet and messy rollout threw TikTok deal into disarray," SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As China's ByteDance raced to seal a deal with Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Walmart Inc WMT.N to keep its video-sharing app TikTok operational in the United States, an apparent breakthrough came last Wednesday in a phone call to U.S. Treasury officials. A top ByteDance lawyer conveyed that the Chinese company would agree to terms put forth by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel chaired by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks. U.S. officials are concerned that the personal data of as many as 100 million American TikTok users could be passed on to China’s Communist Party government. What appeared as a coup clinched by Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N investment banker, did not hold. ByteDance would subsequently announce a deal under which TikTok would remain its subsidiary, contradicting Oracle and Walmart, which said the majority owners would be Americans. ByteDance’s version of the deal would also defy President Donald Trump’s order last month calling for the Beijing-based company to relinquish ownership of the app in the United States. Four sources familiar with the frenzied negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained how a preliminary deal for TikTok announced by Trump on Saturday remains in dispute. With ByteDance and TikTok’s suitors angling for an agreement that both the United States and China can approve, key elements of what would be the social media industry’s biggest-ever deal, potentially worth more than $50 billion, were not spelled out in a comprehensive contract that is typically seen in high-stakes mergers. Instead, the companies were asked to agree in principle at breakneck speed to a CFIUS 20-page revision, awash in red font with mark-ups, to a proposal that ByteDance had submitted only four days before. If ByteDance did not have a deal by Sunday, the Commerce Department would block downloads and updates to the TikTok app. Oracle and the Treasury declined to comment. ByteDance and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment. After Trump got assurances from Oracle and Walmart on Friday that they would create 25,000 new jobs at TikTok and a launch an educational initiative for children, he decided to announce the deal himself, without a contract drawn up or a plan for how it could be presented to bring China onboard. He delayed the announcement until Saturday, following the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. With Trump providing scarce detail, Walmart and Oracle scrambled to issue a statement outlining the key terms of the deal as they understood them. When ByteDance then issued a statement about the deal on Monday, it conflicted with Oracle and Walmart’s statement. All the sides agree that Oracle would take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global, a newly-created U.S. company that will house TikTok's Global business and store U.S. user data on its cloud, with Walmart Inc WMT.N taking a 7.5% stake. But the fate of the remaining 80% stake in TikTok Global is in dispute. ByteDance said it would hold an 80% stake in TikTok Global itself, until it launches an initial public offering in the next twelve months, and that it would then gradually reduce its stake. Oracle said on Monday that ByteDance would not have a stake in TikTok Global, and that it would be ByteDance’s investors who would be awarded the remaining 80% stake. This is also how some Trump administration officials, and even a top ByteDance investor, have privately described the deal. This discrepancy could be enough to scuttle the deal. If the Beijing-based company gets to keep a majority stake, it would represent a major reversal for the White House. If ByteDance got no stake in TikTok Global, it would be a blow to China, where officials have been opposed to stripping ByteDance of one of its most prized assets. “The divergent messages from ByteDance and Oracle reflect the difficulty of trying to thread the needle of pleasing Washington and Beijing, if that is a needle that even exists,” said John Kabealo, a regulatory lawyer not involved in the discussions. It remains unclear whether the conflicting descriptions of the deal, which still requires further CFIUS review, are the result of ambiguity in the terms or a push by ByteDance to alleviate Chinese concerns about caving in to U.S. pressure. One way Oracle and ByteDance had tried to minimize differences over TikTok Global’s ownership is by stressing that the new company will be majority American-owned. About 41% of ByteDance’s current investors are from the United States. By counting indirect U.S. ownership alongside Oracle and Walmart’s direct ownership, ByteDance could claim that TikTok Global would be majority American, even if the Chinese firm owns an 80% stake. The clock is ticking for the companies to come to terms. The Commerce Department has extended until Sunday its deadline for the companies to finalize a deal before TikTok is banned from app stores in the United States. A deal is unlikely by then, and the companies may ask for a new extension, two of the sources said. Ownership of TikTok Global is not the only issue that has to be ironed out. While CFIUS has approved a broad plan on how Oracle will store U.S. user data and inspect TikTok’s source code, details such as precise protocols for security fixes have yet to be hammered out.

Volkswagen to pay victims of Brazil dictatorship in landmark settlement," BERLIN/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE will pay about 36 million reais (£5.1 million) in compensation and donations to atone for the persecution of former employees during Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, the carmaker said on Wednesday. A government-appointed commission investigating abuses during Brazil’s dictatorship found evidence that companies including Volkswagen secretly helped the military identify suspected “subversives” and union activists on their payrolls. Many of the workers were then fired, detained or harassed by police, and were unable to find new jobs for years afterward, a Reuters investigation here showed in 2014. Volkswagen said it signed a settlement agreement on Wednesday with Brazilian state and federal prosecutors in Sao Paulo that includes the payment of 16.8 million reais to an association of former employees and their surviving dependents. The remainder of the money will be donated to various human rights-related efforts. The Brazilian prosecutors said in a statement that the deal will settle three probes launched since 2015. “It is important to deal responsibly with this negative chapter in Brazil’s history and promote transparency,” VW board member Hiltrud Werner said in a Portuguese-language statement from the company. Volkswagen’s settlement was first reported by German broadcasters NDR, SWR and the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Historian Christopher Kopper from the University of Bielefeld, who was commissioned by Volkswagen to look into the case, said the settlement would be historic. “It would be the first time that a German company accepts responsibility for human rights violations against its own workers for events that happened after the end of National Socialism,” he told NDR, SWR and SZ. Volkswagen said in its statement that while Kopper’s investigation found cooperation between its Brazilian security agents and the military regime, there was no clear evidence that cooperation was institutionalized in the company.",Business
"Trump imposes new bans on Cuban rum, cigars, hotels"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday banned U.S. citizens from bringing home rum or cigars from Cuba and from staying at Cuban government-owned hotels, as he sought to lock in the Cuban-American vote in the swing state of Florida ahead of November’s presidential election. Since Trump took office in January 2017, he has been rolling back a detente with America’s old Cold War foe pursued by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump’s aides believe his toughened stance has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in a state where he and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are locked in a tight race. “Today, as part of our continuing fight against communist oppression, I am announcing that the Treasury Department will prohibit U.S. travelers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government,” Trump said at a White House event. “We’re also further restricting the importation of alcohol and Cuban tobacco,” the Republican president said at the ceremony honoring Bay of Pigs veterans. Trump’s decision overturns Obama’s policy of allowing American travelers to bring back as much of Cuba’s legendary rum and cigars that they could carry in their baggage for personal use. A Treasury factsheet said U.S. citizens would be allowed to buy rum and cigars while visiting the Communist-run island, but would no longer be permitted to bring those products home. “The current U.S. authorities insist on the application of a sanctions policy against Cuba that has not achieved the proposed objectives in 60 years,” said a Cuban embassy official in Washington. “It is a wrong policy that is widely rejected by American society and even among Cuban Americans.” The measures - which bar Americans from staying at more than 430 hotels owned or controlled by the government and impose new restrictions on professional meetings, performances and sports competitions - are intended to deny revenue to Cuban authorities. They are not expected to have any immediate impact since the island is closed off to foreign travelers due to the coronavirus pandemic. Carrie Filipetti, deputy assistant secretary of state for Cuba and Venezuela, said the new policy “will continue even past the pandemic.” Trump and Biden are competing fiercely in Florida, which Trump won in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points. Trump will hold a rally in Jacksonville on Thursday. Filipetti denied the measures were timed for electoral gain, saying they had been in the works for some time. In June 2019, the Trump administration imposed heavy new restrictions on travel to Cuba, saying the move aimed to further pressure the Communist government over its support for Venezuela’s embattled President Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this year, the Trump administration ordered Marriott International MAR.O to wind down hotel operations in Communist-run Cuba. Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, was the first U.S. hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid normalization of relations sought by Obama.",Business

GoodRx shares jump 40% in Nasdaq debut after $1 billion IPO," (Reuters) - Shares of private-equity-backed GoodRx Holdings Inc GDRX.O surged 40% in their debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday after the online prescription drug platform raised $1.14 billion in its initial public offering. The stock opened at $46, compared with the IPO price of $33 per share, which was above its targeted range. At the opening price, GoodRx is valued at nearly $18 billion, more than six times the valuation it commanded during its last private fundraise in 2018. GoodRx’s shares hit a session high of $49.57, a jump of over 50%. The California-based company gathers information for more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies to track drug prices and offers discount coupons. It makes money by charging fees to partnering pharmacy benefits managers. “We just think now is really a fantastic time to raise our profile, sure, but more importantly to be able to offer these services to people at a time when they need it,” Doug Hirsch, GoodRx’s co-chief executive and co-founder, said in an interview. GoodRx's debut comes on the heels of the successful IPOs of data warehouse company Snowflake Inc SNOW.N and Unity Software Inc U.N, underscoring investor appetite for new stocks which promise rapid revenue growth. Moreover, shelter-in-place restrictions to control the pandemic have prompted people to turn to virtual consultations and online purchases of medicines, benefiting companies like GoodRx, which is among the few startups to be profitable at the time of its IPO. “Healthcare companies have been the most active segment of the IPO market this year,” said Kathleen Smith of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “Investors had a strong interest in GoodRx due to its 50%+ revenue growth and superior 40%+ EBITDA margins.” GoodRx posted $257 million in revenue for the first six months of 2020, up from $173 million a year earlier. Net income totaled $55 million, compared with $31 million last year.",Business
Tesla's Nevada lithium plan faces stark obstacles on path to production," (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O plan to produce lithium for electric vehicle batteries close to its Nevada Gigafactory faces stark challenges from the outset, including an onerous permitting process, uncertain access to water and questions about unproven methodologies. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told shareholders on Tuesday Tesla has secured rights to 10,000 acres in Nevada where it aims to produce lithium from clay deposits using a process developed internally. The move would make Tesla the first company in the world to commercially produce the white metal from clay. Lithium is produced either from brine, commonly found in South America, or spodumene hard rock, usually in Australia. In Nevada, Tesla plans to mix clay with table salt and then add water, which it says causes a reaction where the salt would leach out with lithium, which can then be extracted. The leftover clay would be put back in the earth to mitigate environmental damage. “It’s a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium,” said Musk, who did not say where in Nevada the company had obtained the lithium rights or whether development has started. The plan drew backlash almost immediately, with critics describing Musk’s plan as too simplistic and light on details. Returning rock to the earth after minerals are extracted, for instance, is already common industry practice through the use of tailings dams. “This plan from Tesla brings up a lot more questions than it answers,” said Chris Berry, an independent lithium industry consultant. “Are we just supposed to take Elon Musk’s word for it that the cost will be lower than existing lithium projects?” Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nevada already has several lithium clay projects under development, including one from Lithium Americas Corp LAC.TO that has been seeking federal permit approval for more than a decade and another from ioneer Ltd INR.AX. Lithium Americas has said it is confident it can successfully extract lithium from clay through a process that involves acid leaching. Tesla said its process won’t involve acid, fueling further questions. “If producing lithium in commercial amounts at battery quality grades from clay was feasible, why isn’t it already being done?” said Berry. Any lithium project from Tesla would require an intensive application process for necessary permits that could stretch on for years. ""Mining lithium is very challenging,"" said Pedro Palandrani of the Global X Lithium & Battery Technology ETF LIT.P, which holds shares in Tesla and lithium producers. ""If Tesla really wants to fly solo, we're talking about four to five years to really see any kind of lithium production."" Tesla’s plan also would likely require substantial amounts of water, forcing the company to battle with cattle ranchers for access to underground reservoirs in the arid state. Albemarle Corp ALB.N operated the only existing U.S. lithium mine at a site roughly 200 miles (322 km) north of Las Vegas until it shut it down last month. Operational since the late 1960s, the site produced less than 5,000 tonnes of lithium per year, a relatively small amount and far less than Tesla would need.",Business
Nikola's talks with energy firms stalled after short-seller report - WSJ," (Reuters) - Nikola Corp's NKLA.O talks with energy firms including BP PLC BP.L to build hydrogen-refueling stations have been stalled following a short-seller's allegations that the electric automaker misled investors, the Wall Street Journal reported.

"Oil edges higher after U.S. crude, fuel stockpiles draw down"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday, supported by U.S. government data that showed crude and fuel inventories dropped last week, though concerns about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic capped gains. Brent crude LCOc1 rose 5 cents to settle at $41.77 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 gained 13 cents to settle at $39.93 a barrel. U.S. crude, gasoline and distillate inventories all fell last week, Energy Information Administration data showed. Crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell by 1.6 million barrels, less than forecast; gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI dropped more than expected, sliding by 4 million barrels; while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI posted a surprise drawdown of 3.4 million barrels. “The big surprise was the distillates were well below average,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. But rising COVID-19 infections in countries including India, France and Spain and new restrictions on businesses in Britain have renewed worries about demand, just as more supply may come from Libya. In the United States, the death toll has passed 200,000. U.S. business activity nudged down in September, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy as the third quarter draws to a close and the pandemic lingers. Meanwhile, China’s diesel exports in August doubled the levels of July to 1.09 million tonnes, customs data showed on Wednesday, as refiners shipped fuel overseas despite poor export margins to reduce brimming domestic oil product inventories. Oil had collapsed as the pandemic decimated demand, with Brent falling below $16 a barrel, a 21-year low, in April. A record output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, has helped revive prices. OPEC faces a new challenge as Libya, an OPEC member that is exempt from the supply cut, is aiming to boost supply after an easing of the country’s conflict. An oil tanker is expected to load crude at Libya’s Marsa el-Hariga terminal this week, the first since January.",Business
"Stocks dip, dollar up as data warns of sputtering recovery"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares dipped and the dollar ticked up near two-month highs on Wednesday as data reaffirmed lingering concerns that new restrictions to counter coronavirus infections will hurt the economic recovery. The speed of recovery in U.S. business activity slowed down in September, with gains at factories more than offset by a retreat at services industries, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy as the third quarter draws to a close and the COVID-19 pandemic lingers. September surveys of private sector activity also painted a gloomy picture in Europe, with rising COVID-19 infections leading to a downturn in services industries. U.S. stocks had opened higher, tracking Europe, but turned negative after the morning data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 5.87 points, or 0.02%, to 27,282.31, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 11.41 points, or 0.34%, to 3,304.16 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 67.08 points, or 0.61%, to 10,896.56. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX rose 0.83% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.16%. Emerging market stocks lost 0.34%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.1% higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 0.06%. In foreign exchange markets, the standout mover was the dollar, which touched its highest level since late July against a basket of six major currencies =USD. “At present, the market is once again dominated by concerns about a second wave of infections, above all in Europe, meaning that the dollar is in demand again,” Commerzbank analysts wrote in a morning note. The dollar index =USD rose 0.322%, with the euro EUR= down 0.36% to $1.1664. The Japanese yen weakened 0.40% versus the greenback at 105.31 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.274, up 0.07% on the day. Oil edged up supported by a report that U.S. fuel inventories fell, although rising crude supply and concern of stalling demand capped gains. “Oil prices are still faring comparatively well today given all the headwinds they are facing – a firm U.S. dollar, concerns about demand, rising supply,” said Carsten Fritsch of Commerzbank.

"J&J kicks off study of single-shot COVID-19 vaccine in 60,000 volunteers"," CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N on Wednesday began a 60,000-person trial of an experimental single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that, if proven effective, could simplify distribution of millions of doses compared with leading rivals requiring two doses. The company expects results of the Phase III trial by year end or early next year, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said in a joint news conference with officials from the National Institutes of Health and the Trump administration. J&J plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Stoffels said. Rival vaccines from Moderna Inc MRNA.O, Pfizer Inc PFE.N and AstraZeneca AZN.L all require two shots separated by several weeks, which make them more difficult to administer and means twice as much vaccine is needed to inoculate the same number of people. “The benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,” Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, said in a telephone interview. The J&J vaccine also does not need to be stored at extremely cold temperatures, Barouch noted, another advantage over some rival vaccine candidates. J&J shares were up 1.2%. “Big news. Numerous great companies are seeing fantastic results. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) must move quickly,” U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet. J&J published a detailed study protocol for its Phase III trial on Wednesday on the company’s website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these details available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials. PROTECTION ‘FOR A LONG TIME’ Stoffels said J&J started the late-stage study after seeing positive results in its combined Phase I/II trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently. Stoffels said the safety and level of protection demonstrated in the earlier trial were on par with what was seen in the company’s animal studies. The results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection “for a long time,” he said. J&J’s late-stage trial will be conducted at as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The trial will assess whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose. It will also seek to detect if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus. Stoffels said it likely will take six weeks to two months to fully enroll the trial. J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it will be ready to start distribution soon after an FDA green light. The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness at pre-set intervals. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three vaccines being supported by the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed - J&J’s, Moderna’s and AstraZeneca’s - share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said. J&J’s trial would be considered a success if it proves to be 60% effective, with a study protocol that could have an efficacy answer after 154 people became infected with the virus. Stoffels said the company will start counting COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated. The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine’s efficacy after 20 trial participants have become infected. Collins said the DSMB does not include any government employees and is made up of “very highly experienced” scientists and statistical experts. “Until they are convinced that there’s something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,” Collins said. His comments follow concerns that government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election bid. In August, J&J signed an agreement with the British government on a global Phase III clinical trial to study a two-dose version of its vaccine, which will run in parallel with the single-dose trial. Stoffels, in the briefing, said the single-dose version would be “very important for emergency use.” The company will later test a booster dose that could produce even greater immunity to the virus, he added.",Business
Lockdown baking boom boosts General Mills sales," (Reuters) - Cheerios maker General Mills Inc on Wednesday reported quarterly sales and profits that beat estimates as a surge in baking and cooking by stuck-at-home students and families drove a jump in sales in most of its product lines. The company said it has seen a 91% increase in 18- to 24-year-olds visiting its Pillsbury and Betty Crocker websites since the start of the crisis, with 7 million monthly visitors seeking out recipes made from those brands’ dough and cake mixes. That helped sales of its baking products and meals jump 31% in the quarter, allowing the Yoplait yogurt maker to raise its quarterly dividend by 4% and its shares rose as much as 3.5% in early trading in response. With more people continuing to work from home and an increasing number of students taking online classes, demand for breakfast items like Cheerios cereal and Yoplait also jumped. The company held or grew share in 8 out of its 10 top retail categories in the three months ended August, and said it continued to expect at-home demand to remain elevated in the current quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. It expects high single-digit retail sales growth in North America. “Not only are we gaining share, we’re attracting new consumers in this environment,” Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Harmening said, adding the new customers were heavily skewed to younger and Hispanic households than existing users. Net earnings rose nearly 23% to $639 million in the first quarter, but could be pressured over the next three months as the company increasingly uses third-party manufacturers to meet retail demand and spends more on hygiene and sanitation measures. Since the start of the pandemic, General Mills has employed around 30 new external manufacturers to boost its capacity by about 25% in North America, Harmening said.",Business
"U.S. business activity slows, house price inflation accelerates"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity cooled in September, with gains at factories offset by a retreat at services industries, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy as the third quarter draws to a close and COVID-19 lingers. The economy’s recovery from the pandemic recession is losing speed as government financial help to businesses and the unemployed dries up. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the U.S. central bank needed to remain focused on supporting the recovery. “We need to stay with it ... the recovery will go faster if there is support coming both from Congress and the Fed,” Powell said. Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, slipped to a reading of 54.4 this month from 54.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output. Though the private sector continues to expand, this month’s dip in the index was in line with views that the economy’s momentum was ebbing. Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 32% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947. The coronavirus crisis wiped out more than five years of growth, and economists are calling for another aid package from the government to help the fragile recovery. The economy slipped into recession in February. “The question now turns to whether the economy’s strong performance can be sustained into the fourth quarter,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, noting that the uncertainty over the Nov. 3 presidential election had also risen. “Risks therefore seem tilted to the downside for the coming months, as businesses await clarity with respect to both the path of the pandemic and the election.” Moderation in business activity was not confined to the United States. Euro zone business growth ground to a halt this month amid a renewed downturn in the dominant services sector, a separate survey from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday. Six months after the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, coronavirus cases remain high, with the death toll in the country exceeding 200,000 on Tuesday - by far the highest number of any nation. The survey’s services sector flash PMI fell to 54.6 this month from a reading of 55.0 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 54.7 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. The services industry has been hardest hit by the virus and remains below its pre-pandemic level. A measure of service industry employment slipped this month. In contrast, manufacturing firms signaled an acceleration in activity. The flash manufacturing PMI increased to 53.5 this month from 53.1 in August. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11% of the economy, holding at 53.1 this month. A measure of new orders received by factories edged down to a reading of 54 from 54.1 in August. “The shift from a few months with large increases across PMI components to more mixed results looks broadly consistent with many economic indicators that point to a loss of momentum lately following a period with widespread and robust gains as the economy started recovering from the virus-related shock,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. While the overall economy is showing signs of slowing, the housing market is pressing ahead, driven by historically low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. The strong demand for housing has not been matched by an increase in supply, boosting house price inflation. A separate report on Wednesday showed the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 1.0% in July after a similar gain in June. House prices jumped 6.5% on a year-on-year basis in July. That was the biggest annual gain since June 2018 and followed a 5.8% increase in June. The FHFA’s index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed house prices surged 11.4% in August from a year ago. “We expect demand from buyers fleeing urban areas to taper off, while the weakening recovery in the labor market will pose headwinds to housing activity,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “Sparse inventory, particularly of existing homes, will keep a solid floor under home prices even if demand softens from its recent level.”",Business
A little help from our friends: banks team up as FX trading gets tougher," LONDON (Reuters) - Faced with the costs of competing in a world of electronic and algorithmic trading, many banks are outsourcing parts of their foreign exchange businesses, a trend that may cement big lenders’ dominance of global currency trading. Loose, informal relationships where smaller players rely on bigger peers for the best prices and liquidity have long existed in the $6.6 trillion-a-day FX market. But as high-tech trading supercharges competition for the fastest speeds and tightest prices, more formal tie-ups are becoming common. Given the importance of forex to corporate clients, few banks would opt to drastically reduce FX operations, the way they could with equities trading, for example. They are choosing instead to pull back from areas where they cannot compete but still want to sell to their customers. “UK and European banks have had to focus on areas of strength and an inevitable consequence of this is to look for partnerships. Naturally it makes sense to sub-contract some [FX trading],” said Simon Manwaring, who heads currency trading at NatWest Markets. This can involve accessing liquidity provided by multiple other banks, or more formal agreements to rely on a specific institution for certain currencies, or during a specific time of the trading day. While outsourcing constitutes a small part of NatWest’s trading volume, Manwaring said it makes sense for currencies or time zones where the bank has little geographic presence. The opacity of FX markets makes it impossible to measure the scale of the practice, which is often called “white labelling” because the end client always trades with and has exposure to their own bank. But what is clear is the growing concentration in trading, with the FX market share of the five top banks rising to 41% in the first half of 2020, versus 37% in 2016, data from Coalition shows. Sweden’s SEB looks to other banks to supply liquidity in emerging market currencies, certain FX option products and to help execute computer-run algo trading, its global head of FX, Svante Hedin, told Reuters. He added that the progression of technology had accelerated outsourcing. Other factors behind the shift include shrinking profit margins and regulations like Europe’s Mifid II, which require banks and investors secure the best execution prices for clients. Measuring prices paid on FX deals through third-party transaction analysis is far easier now than five years ago, market participants note. The big lenders dismiss fears that outsourcing will further tighten their grip, noting that their dominance and creditworthiness allow them to offer clients the best prices in the safest way. (Graphic: Market share FX markets - ) There are also real hurdles to clear. Industry insiders say conversations often lead nowhere, while formal agreements between two institutions are particularly tough as banks and clients baulk at exclusive arrangements that restrict their ability to trade with others. Newer electronic market-making outfits such as Citadel Securities and XTX Markets have also joined the fray to supply liquidity, although their role is largely limited to spot trading. Kevin Kimmel, Global Head of eFX at Citadel Securities, said market-makers had to show “exceptional execution quality” so that banks -- who will still have the reputational risk of offering uncompetitive prices -- felt comfortable offering those prices to clients. The newer entrants compete with banks on multi-dealer trading platforms, as well as offering outsourcing tie-ups so banks can use their liquidity. While XTX recently launched an FX execution algorithm marketed to investors, banks and trading platforms, Citadel Securities has increased the number of white labelling partnerships it has with banks this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. The firm’s primary focus in recent years has been on algo liquidity provision, though it has also been involved in various other types of white labelling arrangements. So what’s next? Despite the recent growth, outsourcing in FX remains limited. But Vincent Bonamy, head of global intermediary services at HSBC, believes more and wider agreements are on the cards. “The interesting part of this is the potential expansion into broader outsourcing among different players in the market,” he said. “It’s not only about distribution but (also) FX settlement and execution potentially.”",Business
Exclusive: PDVSA's customers schedule last oil cargoes amid U.S.-imposed wind-down - sources," MEXICO CITY/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A handful of long-term customers of Venezuela’s PDVSA have begun winding down oil trade with the state-run company by scheduling the last cargoes to depart from the sanctioned country ahead of a U.S. deadline, five sources close to the decisions told Reuters. The U.S. government has given the firms - which include Spain's Repsol REP.MC, Italy's Eni ENI.MI, India's Reliance Industries RELI.NS and Thailand's Tipco Asphalt TASCO.BK - deadlines ranging between October and November for ending exemptions to the sanctions allowing some companies still to receive Venezuelan oil, the sources said. With U.S. elections looming in November, the Trump administration is seeking to raise the heat on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was not recognized by most Western nations. Repsol, which since late 2018 had been receiving crude under a swap deal with PDVSA authorized by the U.S. Treasury Department allowing the Spanish company to cash pending debt, received its most recent cargo of Venezuelan oil this month on tanker Delta Ios, according to PDVSA’s exports schedules. The company does not plan to charter a new vessel to pick up Venezuelan crude after October, a company source said. In response to Reuters’ questions, a Repsol spokesman said the firm “abides by the international norms in force and will keep on abiding.” Eni, currently receiving crude under a similar swap deal, plans to take a Venezuelan oil cargo later this month on tanker Delta Captain and probably another in October before temporarily ending trade, according to PDVSA’s documents and a company source. A spokesperson for Eni declined to comment on specific cargoes, but said the company “is operating and will operate in full compliance with applicable sanctions regulations and in continuous dialogue with the relevant authorities.” Thailand’s Tipco Asphalt has three more cargoes of Venezuelan heavy crude scheduled to load through October, all of them bound for its Kemaman refinery in Malaysia, according to the documents and a company source. Tipco Asphalt said in a letter to Thailand’s stock exchange this month that the U.S. State Department had contacted the firm in August asking it to wind down procurement of Venezuelan oil by the end of November, warning the company that it could be subject to U.S. sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Tipco added this it was “taking steps to comply with such request,” including a temporary shutdown of its Kemaman refinery until finding alternative oil supplies. The company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for further comment. And Reliance Industries, which in July received a temporary U.S. authorization to swap Venezuelan oil for diesel for the OPEC-member nation, has received some 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude so far this month and plans to import almost 5 million barrels more in the coming weeks, the PDVSA documents showed. A source close to Reliance’s plans said the firm will halt imports of Venezuelan oil in November and also shipments of diesel to the nation after a cargo currently on its way. The pause would last for at least two months and a decision on whether to resume the trade would be taken after the U.S. election. Reliance and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment. As PDVSA’s pool of traditional customers has shrunk since last year due to sanctions, sales to mostly unknown or inexperienced firms accused by Washington of acting as shell companies have partially replaced them. A large portion of the crude taken by these firms ends up in China. Venezuela has also received help from Iran this year as trade between the two sanctioned nations has deepened. A large tanker that delivered Iranian condensate to PDVSA earlier this month is now loading Venezuelan crude for Iran’s national oil company. It is yet unknown if Washington will resume authorizing PDVSA’s customers to take Venezuelan oil under swap deals. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment. U.S. special envoy for Venezuela and Iran, Elliott Abrams, told Reuters that sanctions are “increasingly effective in denying revenue” to Maduro’s administration. “Around the globe, leading companies are abiding by our sanctions, and acting responsibly and transparently. We appreciate their cooperation,” he added. Even though scheduled cargoes of Venezuelan crude for Repsol, Eni, Tipco and Reliance are expected to finish soon once authorizations granted by Washington expire, the exchanged fuels most of these companies are delivering to PDVSA have continued arriving in Venezuelan ports, the documents also showed. Venezuela expects the arrival this month of about 820,000 barrels of Iranian gasoline on tankers Forest, Faxon and Fortune, currently crossing the Atlantic Ocean.",Business
Huawei chairman urges U.S. to reconsider 'attack' on global supply chain," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies said on Wednesday its supply chain was under attack from the United States and called on Washington to reconsider its trade restrictions which were hurting suppliers globally. The world’s biggest maker of mobile telecommunications equipment and smartphones is under pressure from U.S. trade curbs designed to choke Huawei’s access to commercially available chips. “The U.S. has modified their sanctions for the third time and that has indeed brought great challenges to our production and operations,” Huawei Chairman Guo Ping told reporters in Shanghai. Washington says Huawei is a vehicle for Chinese state espionage and from Sept. 15 imposed new curbs barring U.S. companies from supplying or servicing the company. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a national security risk. Guo said that although Huawei had sufficient chips for its business-to-business operations, including its 5G network enterprise, it was feeling the pinch of the U.S. restrictions on its smartphone chip stocks. It understood that suppliers such as Qualcomm were applying for U.S. licences which would allow them to continue serving Huawei, he added. Intel has already received licences to supply certain products to Huawei, while China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which uses U.S.-origin machinery to produce chips for Huawei, has applied for a licence, Reuters has previously reported. Huawei was willing to use Qualcomm chips in its smartphones should Qualcomm get a licence to sidestep the restrictions, Guo added. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We hope the U.S. government can reconsider its policy and if the U.S. government allows it we are still willing to buy products from U.S. companies,” Guo said on the sidelines of its annual Huawei Connect conference. Huawei has said that from Sept. 15 it would stop manufacturing its most advanced chips under its Kirin line which power its high-end phones. Analysts expect its existing supply of Kirin chips will run out next year. Consumers have rushed to buy Huawei phones amid concerns its mobile division is about to fold. Vendors say that prices have spiked by as much as 500 yuan ($74) for some devices. Washington has shown little sign that it is willing to back down from its fight with Huawei, which comes at a time when relations between the United States and China are at their worst in decades. The United States said last month it would expand a programme it called “Clean Network” to prevent various Chinese apps and telecoms companies from accessing sensitive information on American citizens and businesses. David Wang, a Huawei executive director, said the company hoped that countries would introduce “rational standards” for 5G. Huawei had yet to see any adverse impact on its global 5G business from the U.S. programme, he added.",Business
JPMorgan to move $230 billion of assets to Germany ahead of Brexit - source," LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is moving about 200 billion euros ($234 billion) of assets from the United Kingdom to Germany as a result of Britain’s exit from the European Union, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. In January, the bank had also announced it would significantly expand its Paris hub as part of plans to relocate some services from London after Brexit. The shift sees JPMorgan follow similar moves by other big banks in Britain, as regulators in continental financial hubs such as Frankfurt and Dublin urge banks to book their assets locally. Barclays for example has moved its European headquarters and almost 200 billion euros in assets to Dublin, Reuters reported last year. The source did not specify what type of assets JPMorgan was moving to Germany, but for banks making similar moves, it would typically include cash and financial securities such as stocks and bonds that banks hold in inventory for clients to trade. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. The shift in assets represents part of banks’ routine planning for life after Britain leaves the European Union, when they will likely no longer be able to book their entire trading operations for the contintent out of London. Clients of those banks in Europe will now trade with the lenders’ local banking entities rather than the UK-based subsidiary. Banks using Britain as a gateway to the European Union must fully execute their plans for serving EU customers before a Brexit transition period ends in December, the EU’s banking watchdog said in July. Last year, consultancy EY said assets worth nearly $1 trillion were being moved from Britain to new financial hubs in the European Union ahead of Brexit. (reut.rs/33Upshd) JPMorgan plans to finish the migration of assets to its Frankfurt-based subsidiary by the end of 2020, according to Bloomberg News which first reported the asset shift earlier on Wednesday.

Nike shares set for record high after digital sales power stellar results," (Reuters) - Nike Inc’s shares were set to open at a record high on Wednesday after the world’s largest sports shoemaker posted stellar quarterly results, driven by online sales. Shares of the company were up 12.6% at $131.6 in premarket trading. The brand’s digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset fall in sales at traditional brick-and-mortar stores due to COVID-19 restrictions and social-distancing measures. At least seven brokerages raised their 12-month price targets on the stock with the biggest bump coming from Jefferies analysts, who raised their target to $117 from $95. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said that improvement in North America is the “biggest positive surprise” from Nike’s results, and expects the Beaverton, Oregon-based company to do well in the long term, as consumers focus more on health and wellness. Nike’s results should come as a relief to investors after the company, just a quarter ago, reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets including North America, Europe and China. “Nike offered its clearest signal yet that a higher digital mix and improving margins within the digital segment will push consolidated margins above historical levels,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said.",Business

Tesla's stock loses charge after Musk's battery pitch," (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O shares slumped in early Wall Street trading as investors and analysts tried to make sense of Chief Executive Elon Musk's highly technical ""Battery Day"" presentation that set lofty targets but was hazy on near-term execution. Tesla shares slumped 7.5% in early Wednesday trading, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value from Tuesday’s close. Analysts and investors divided over whether Musk can deliver on his visions of novel, proprietary Tesla batteries that could make electric cars competitive with mass market, petroleum-fueled cars. Some analysts praised Tesla’s impressive technology, capacity and cost targets. But others said Musk’s promises lacked substance and questioned the three-year timeline he outlined for delivering the promised breakthroughs. Musk acknowledged that some of Tesla’s ambitious technology is proving “insanely difficult” to manufacture at high volume. Investors had expected two big announcements from Musk: the development of a “million mile” battery good for 10 years or more, and a specific cost-reduction target - expressed in dollars per kilowatt-hour - that would finally drop the price of an electric vehicle below that of a gasoline car. They got neither from the event, with Musk promising a $25,000 car three years down the line that would “basically be on par” with a gasoline car. Musk has promised such a car for years. Analysts from Swiss banking group UBS said that promise came with risks. “By the time (the car) arrives, there will be significant competition in the segment, from VW group, amongst others,” the bank’s analysts wrote in a note to clients. Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE on Wednesday unveiled its latest electric vehicle, the ID.4 sport utility and said it would be priced to sell in the United States for thousands less than a Tesla Model Y SUV. Tesla has yet to deliver a previously promised $35,000 Model 3 sedan. The lowest-range version of that car currently retails for nearly $38,000 in the United States, with narrow profit margins generally making inexpensive cars unattractive to automakers. Analysts also criticized that it would take at least another year to see some of Tesla’s battery innovations in production. Musk said the company was starting to ramp up the production of larger, more energy-dense cells at a California pilot facility, but acknowledged the process was not yet fully working. At $305, the average target price among the 33 brokerages who follow the company is another $100 lower and several brokerages emphasized that expectations for what the company could deliver were already out of whack with reality as the global economy heads into a potentially long-lasting recession. Morgan Stanley said Musk had shown substantial progress, but also laid bare the scale of the task in front of the company. “Elon can’t do it alone ... Tesla needs help to get there,” its analysts wrote, saying governments, suppliers, investors and engineering talent would have to support the company’s mission. Jed Dorsheimer, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said Tesla’s challenges to scale batteries and manufacturing capacity at affordable rates showed Tesla was a modern day auto, rather than a tech company with high valuations. Tesla’s Battery Day did yield some positive reviews, however. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the three-year plan for achieving 56% reduction in battery costs could materially boost Tesla’s volume and margin outlook. The brokerage moved from the sidelines to assign a “buy” rating on the stock, and raised its price target to $500 from $400.",Business

"Credit Suisse, UBS held tie-up talks backed by both chairmen - Bilanz"," ZURICH (Reuters) - The chairmen of UBS and Credit Suisse supported a merger of equals between Switzerland’s two largest banks during discussions earlier this year, Swiss magazine Bilanz reported on Wednesday, adding talks had since stagnated. The details reported by finance periodical Bilanz suggest that a merger between Credit Suisse and UBS, which had been examined by staff working under UBS chairman Axel Weber in recent months, had been more seriously considered than previously known, receiving backing from both parties. Both UBS and Credit Suisse declined comment. Switzerland’s two biggest banks held tie-up negotiations in the first half of the year, Bilanz reported, citing two unnamed sources involved in the discussions. Although kept secret, a merger had been considered seriously, one source told Bilanz, receiving the backing of both UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner, who is due to retire from his post in 2021. However, discussions had dropped off since the summer holidays, one source told Bilanz, amid a drop in Credit Suisse’s share price placing the banks’ respective valuations beyond the merger of equals threshold. Reuters reported last week that the board of UBS had gathered to discuss strategy, but a merger with Credit Suisse was not on the official agenda, suggesting cooling interest in the idea. Both chief executives of UBS and Credit Suisse expressed expectations of an up-tick in consolidation within Europe’s banking sector at a conference on Tuesday, with UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti calling more deals “inevitable”.",Business
Brazil's steep rate curve should pose no threat to government funding," BRASILIA (Reuters) - Despite a spike in Brazil’s long-term interest rates serving as a “warning” to remedy public finances, the central bank’s record low official interest rate means there is little risk - if any - to the government’s ability to service its ballooning debt. The steepening of the Brazilian rate curve reflects investors demanding higher premiums to lend longer term to the government due to growing worries over its ability to reduce record pandemic-fueled borrowing. Treasury Secretary Bruno Funchal told Reuters this week the spike in market-based rates was a “warning” and said policymakers have “no room for error” to return to fiscal discipline. That, at least, is the orthodox narrative. But as the Treasury admits, the slide in the central bank’s key Selic interest rate since last year to 2.00% has brought the average cost of funding the federal public debt to its lowest on record. As the minutes of the central bank’s last policy meeting showed on Tuesday, the Selic is unlikely to be raised for a very long time, and could even be reduced further. As long as the Selic stays ‘lower for longer’, the Treasury’s shift in strategy to increase short-term debt issuance could also help put a cap on borrowing costs. “Brazil is facing an unprecedented scenario of very low interest rates for a very long time,” said Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “This buys the country a lot of time to adjust the fiscal accounts and adopt a lot of imprudent policies.” “We’re not in the 1980s anymore,” she said. The difference between near- and longer-term borrowing costs on many parts of the Brazilian interest rate curve is the widest since the height of the public health and economic crisis earlier this year. Spreads are close to breaching even these historic peaks. But as the chart below from the Treasury shows, the average cost of servicing the federal debt and new borrowing in July was historically low. With the Selic having been cut further since then, it will likely be even lower. The average cost of servicing the overall stock of federal domestic debt in the 12 months to July was 7.4%. At the end of last year, it was 8.7%, and four years ago it was 14%. Similarly, the average cost of issuing new federal domestic debt in the 12 months through July was 5.1%, compared with almost 7% at the end of last year and over 14% four years ago. (GRAPHIC: Brazil's average cost of funding - ) Ratings agency Moody’s, more vocal than most on the need to reduce deficits and debt, said on Wednesday that Brazil’s government has benefited hugely from record low interest rates, and will continue to do so. “(Brazil’s) debt affordability has improved significantly, dropping to 18% in 2019 from nearly 30% in 2015. We expect this ratio to continue to improve in 2021,” Moody’s said in a note, referring to interest payments as a share of government revenue. “Considering Brazil’s large stock of debt, the drop in interest rates has a material positive impact on its credit quality,” it added. Brazil’s government expects to amass a primary budget deficit this year of 866 billion reais ($158 billion), more than 12% of gross domestic product, with some private sector economists pegging the shortfall closer to 1 trillion reais. This will swell the accumulated gross debt close to 100% of GDP, from 76% at the end of last year, also a record and significantly higher than most emerging economies. This has forced Treasury to raise more funds via short-term issuance, a potentially risky strategy highlighted by some failed floating-rate ‘LFT’ debt auctions lately. On Friday, investors bought only a fifth of the LFT notes on offer. But Treasury officials appear relaxed. Luis Felipe Vital, head of public debt operations, played down the recent weak demand for LFT paper and said shorter-term borrowing is “super positive” for the Treasury in terms of cost. Similarly, the steep curve does not appear to be an issue either. “Even though premiums have clearly increased recently, the cost to the Treasury remains historically low,” Vital told Reuters. “Are higher premiums a cost issue for the Treasury? Not at all. Treasury (funding) costs are the lowest since our series began.” The Treasury needs to refinance some 835 billion reais of federal public debt maturing in the next 12 months, and 889 billion reais in calendar 2021, central bank figures show. These are big numbers. But with interest rates so low, they are manageable.",Business
Exclusive: Nigeria's Buhari to send long-awaited oil reform bill to Senate - sources," LAGOS(Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has signed a long-awaited oil-reform bill and it will be formally presented in the Senate as early as next week, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The legislation has been in the works for the past 20 years, and the main laws governing Nigeria’s oil and gas exploration have not been fully updated since the 1960s because of the contentious nature of any change to oil taxes, terms and revenue-sharing within Nigeria. But reforms and regulatory certainty became more pressing this year as low oil prices and a shift towards renewable energy made competition for investment from oil majors tougher. The alignment of both chambers with Buhari’s All Progressives Congress party has also given the reforms the best chance of passage in years. Buhari officially signed the bill late last week, and his team has already been building support for it in the National Assembly. The sources, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the assembly has already chosen teams of members who will work most closely on individual portions of the bill. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives must approve it before Buhari can sign it into law. Two presidential spokesmen declined to comment and the Senate had no immediate comment. The Ministry of Petroleum Resources sent the draft, the product of months of consultation between Nigerian officials, oil and gas companies and other industry stakeholders, to Buhari last month. Excerpts from the bill seen by Reuters included provisions that would streamline and reduce some oil and gas royalties, boost the amount of money companies pay to local communities and for environmental clean-ups and alter the dispute resolution process between companies and the government. It also included measures to push companies to develop gas discoveries and a framework for gas tariffs and delivery. Commercialising gas, particularly for use in local power generation, is a core government priority.",Business
"Brexit positivity returns: UK 'confident' of a deal, EU 'determined' for one"," LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain’s Brexit supremo Michael Gove said on Wednesday that he was confident of securing a trade deal with the European Union, while the bloc’s chief negotiator said he was determined to clinch an agreement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson plunged Brexit into chaos earlier this month by unveiling, and then pressing ahead with, draft legislation that would undercut parts of the 2020 EU divorce treaty. The EU said it could not trust Britain if it broke international law, explored what legal action it could take and demanded London pull back from the brink. But after two weeks of recriminations between London and Brussels, two of the most powerful players in the negotiations said on Wednesday they were determined to do a deal. When asked on arrival in London before informal talks if he was optimistic about reaching a deal, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told Reuters: “I am determined.” Four hours later, Britain said it was determined too. “We’re absolutely determined to do everything that we can to secure a deal,” Cabinet Office Minister Gove, one of Johnson’s most senior ministers, told parliament. “No-deal is in nobody’s interests.” Britain left the EU in January but under a transition arrangement remains a member in all but name until the end of the year, by which time it hopes to have clinched a free trade deal with the bloc. Talks have snagged on fishing, state aid rules and how trade will flow to Northern Ireland, which will remain - under the 2020 divorce treaty - in closer orbit to the EU than will the rest of the United Kingdom. Gove said the sticking point was that the EU still had not come to grips with Britain’s post-Brexit status as a sovereign state, and so was trying to tie Britain into its rules. “I’m confident we can overcome those difficulties and secure a free trade agreement which would be in everyone’s interests,” Gove said. Barnier said the EU would be firm. “We remain calm, respectful, realistic and firm,” Barnier said, though he declined to comment on the draft legislation that could override parts of Britain’s EU withdrawal agreement, the Internal Market Bill, or on the odds of securing a trade deal. Britain has said it hopes never to need to use proposed powers, while the timetabling of the Internal Market Bill in the British parliament means it will take most of October and November to consider. That means it will not be law either before an EU end-of-September deadline to withdraw the plan, or Johnson’s Oct. 15 deadline for a deal with the EU. “The timetable for the passage of the bill does provide a welcome space for constructive engagement on the concerns raised by the UK,” a senior EU diplomat said. “My understanding is that a decision on possible EU legal action won’t be taken until early October,” the diplomat said. Although the EU is holding a summit on Oct. 1-2, just after the deadline expires, the bloc’s leaders will not consider next steps on relations with Britain until another summit in mid-October.",Business
Dollar gains keep gold pressured near six-week low," (Reuters) - Gold extended losses to its lowest since mid-August on Wednesday as the dollar advanced, with investors awaiting further response from major central banks as economic uncertainty looms. Spot gold dipped 1.5% to $1,870.11 per ounce by 10:42 a.m. ET (1442 GMT), having hit its lowest since Aug. 12 at $1,865.03. U.S. gold futures declined 1.8% to $1,873.20 per ounce. “Gold is currently taking its cue from the dollar ... and the dollar strength continues to weigh on gold,” said Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper. “We could see a retest of the lows from early August, the next technical support level thereafter is around $1,840 per ounce, however prices are closing in on oversold territory.” The dollar index hit an eight-week high, dimming the appeal of bullion to holders of other currencies. Gold prices declined, despite U.S. stocks retreating after data showed U.S. business activity nudged down in September. “Long-term uncertainties are still looming and no investor would lose the opportunity of adding gold to their portfolio when prices are low,” Phillip Streible, a senior market strategist for RJO Futures in Chicago said. “Investors are waiting and watching what the major central banks will do next. At this moment most of the monetary and fiscal policies available have already been implemented.” Policymakers “are not even going to begin thinking” about raising interest rates until inflation hits 2%, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said monetary policy will need to remain accommodative for the next several years and more fiscal stimulus is needed to support the economy. Non-yielding gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency weakening. In other metals, silver slid 4.5% to $23.31, having hit a nearly two-month low of $22.99 earlier in the session. Platinum shed 1.3% to $855.35 per ounce, earlier touching its lowest since July 21 at $845.50, and palladium rose 1% to $2,242.72.",Business
BoE says it should have spotted news conference streaming 'misuse' sooner," LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said it should have been faster to figure out that a company it had hired to stream its news conferences on YouTube was using this access to sell a faster audio feed to financial traders without the BoE’s consent. An internal report published by the BoE on Wednesday gave numerous suggestions on how to stop the same thing happening again, while a separate inquiry by Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority found no misconduct by the company involved. The central bank barred the supplier, Encoded Media, in December 2019 after discovering the company had been selling access to the audio feed. The quarterly news conferences offer valuable insight from the BoE’s governor and his deputies after major policy decisions - and the ability to hear their comments a few seconds faster than on video could confer a big advantage to traders. “Our Review has indicated that there were occasions where, with the benefit of hindsight, this misuse by a third party supplier of the Bank’s audio feed could have been identified sooner by the Bank,” the BoE said. Encoded Media was not immediately available for comment. The FCA, in a parallel investigation, said it did not find any breach of insider trading rules or other misconduct that fell under its jurisdiction. “We do not believe the audio feed contained any inside information, nor have we found any activity of concern or misconduct. Our enquiry is now closed,” the FCA said. The BoE said it received a specific allegation about the use of the audio feed in late 2018, but did not fully investigate it as staff did not believe the news conference could be compromised. It also failed to spot advertisements on social media offering “fast access” to the BoE’s news conferences, the report showed. “Whilst the Bank is confident that the contents of the Bank’s policy announcements...themselves were never compromised, the incident raised questions about the controls relating to the Bank’s press conferences,” the BoE said in its response to the report conducted by its internal auditors. The BoE said Encoded Media had been on a standard contract, and that it would apply tighter checks and bespoke contracts for this type of work in future. Before the coronavirus pandemic, BoE news conferences were broadcast live via a standard over-the-air transmission and also streamed on YouTube. There is a slight broadcast delay for video from both sources, and audio can be sent faster. The BoE said it fully accepted the findings of the report and that Governor Andrew Bailey had commissioned an external review of its support services to work out if further improvements were needed.",Business
"U.S. SEC votes on expanded tipster program to consider more bounties, but with heightened conditions"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday finalized new conditions for its whistleblower bounty program, which will result in rewards being issued faster and some rewards rising in value, agency officials said. Approved in a 3-2 vote along party lines, the changes aim to ensure that eligible whistleblowers automatically get the current maximum 30% award of the resulting fine, a presumption that is not the case under current rules, according to agency officials. The new conditions, first proposed by the agency in 2018, would give staff more discretion to dish out rewards under the program taking into consideration a number of new factors. These include the significance of the tipster’s information; the level of assistance they offer the SEC; the severity of the alleged misconduct; and the whistleblower’s level of involvement in internal compliance systems, among others Even with these new considerations, SEC Chair Jay Clayton told reporters that he expected most rewards to “stay the same or increase, and to be able to issue them faster.” Created following the 2009 financial crisis, the program allows the SEC to reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with between 10% and 30% of the fine. Wednesday’s new rule will presume that a tipster is eligible for the maximum 30%, pending these considerations. It also relaxes a proposal to impose discretionary caps on bounties and to tighten deadlines for formally filing tips, as reported reut.rs/3iTHpTr by Reuters on Tuesday. The agency had proposed requiring that whistleblowers file their formal tip, a long legal document required to claim a bounty, within 30 days of first making contact with SEC staff. On Wednesday, the SEC relaxed that proposed deadline in cases where the whistleblower had not been aware of the agency’s formal filing rule. Created in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis, the program has resulted in more than $2.5 billion in penalties and $523 million in tipster rewards. The program attracts thousands of tips annually, public data shows, overwhelming SEC staff who can take years to assess all the claims and issue awards. The agency has said it views the program as vital, however. Corporate lobbyists have been pushing the SEC to revise the program for years. They say excessive awards have spawned a cottage industry of tipsters and their attorneys who get a cut of the reward, overwhelming SEC staff with unhelpful and sometimes bogus tips. The SEC measure also expands the program’s “related actions” provision, which allows it to distribute awards on behalf of other agencies, to include deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as similar non-judicial settlements made by the Department of Justice. The SEC will give tipsters who would have been eligible if this rule had been in effect when the program began in 2011 90 days to file a claim. Whistleblowers were previously ineligible for awards in these cases, the agency officials said. While some of the agency’s changes may be considered a win for whistleblowers, critics say other measures aimed at efficiency do not outweigh its potential overreliance on agency discretion. Democratic Commissioner Allison Lee said on Wednesday that “I cannot support these new rules that in too many ways increase discretion and restrict access to our program without providing essential clarity, transparency and accountability.”",Business
Geely launches electric vehicle manufacturing platform," BEIJING (Reuters) - Zhejiang Geely Holding Group launched its first electric vehicle-focused platform on Wednesday, aimed at rolling out a variety of models more efficiently for both the Chinese automaker and its partners. As the global auto industry ramps up investment in electric and high-tech vehicles, manufacturers from Volkswagen AG to General Motors Co have introduced platforms for electric vehicles (EVs). Geely’s Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) will be able to support small as well as large vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, vans and pickup trucks, Geely’s president An Conghui said at an event in Beijing. An said Geely, which has a 9.7% stake in Daimler AG, spent 18 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) on research and development for SEA. SEA uses more aluminium to make vehicles lighter and a front steering system for steady driving. An said the platform also enabled Geely to develop more intelligent vehicle technologies, including autonomous driving and connectivity. SEA will use a battery system with a lifespan of 2 million kilometres made by Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, An said. Geely, which sold more than 2 million vehicles last year, will develop vehicles based on the SEA architecture under nine brands including Geely, Volvo, Smart and Lynk & Co. Hangzhou-based Geely said in a statement it was also in talks with other automakers about sharing the platform. It is already building a car plant of its own using the EV architecture, construction documents on Geely’s website showed. Geely and Volvo Cars, which it acquired from Ford Motor Co ten years ago, have jointly developed the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) and B-segment Modular Architecture (BMA) to allow them to develop, design and build different types of compact or smaller cars with similar mechanical layouts faster than before - and at lower cost. An said Geely would also develop conventional hybrid vehicles to improve the fuel efficiency of gasoline cars. ($1 = 6.8059 Chinese yuan renminbi)",Business
"U.S. crude, fuel stocks fall in most recent week - EIA"," (Reuters) - U.S. crude stocks, gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

Exclusive: ECB plots Amazon-style market to prevent Wall Street COVID debt swoop," FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Europe is working on an Amazon-style website to sell hundreds of billions of euros of bank loans which have been soured by the coronavirus crisis, in a bid to shore up the economy and challenge the dominance of big Wall Street debt investors. The blueprint, devised by top European Central Bank (ECB) officials, is part of efforts by the 19-state euro zone to tackle a growing pile of unpaid loans and aims to prevent “distressed debt” funds from buying them at rock bottom prices. “The idea is to open up the market to buyers of smaller portfolios, with an Amazon or eBay-style marketplace, where you can browse ... That can get the market moving,” Edward O’Brien, a senior ECB official involved in the plan, told Reuters. Large funds bought billions of euros of loans in the aftermath of the last financial crisis, in the process acquiring swathes of property some of which has since risen in value. “The market for bad loans has been dominated by a few very large buyers. In a typical scenario, one of these firms may buy a very large portfolio at steep discounts,” O’Brien said. A study by Deloitte found that of the more than 450 billion euros ($529 billion) of loans sold in Europe between 2014 and 2019, roughly half were bought by Cerberus, Blackstone, Lone Star and Goldman Sachs. Blackstone and Cerberus did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs and Lone Star both declined to comment. Banks offload bad debts, normally at a fraction of their face value, to free up their balance sheets to make new loans and keep both their own business and economies going. The ECB scheme, which has yet to be signed off and will be discussed with European Union officials on Friday, is inspired by Italian website BlinkS, which links buyers and sellers of loans, as well as debt auctions by a U.S. federal agency. If EU states agree, the new marketplace could come under the Single Resolution Board (SRB), a European Union agency in Brussels that winds up failing banks. “Why is it that every public contract has to be put out to tender in an open competition and bad loans can be sold off behind closed doors?” Bostjan Jazbec, an SRB director, said. “Success in buying and selling bad loans involves a lot of insider information. COVID means more bad loans ahead. Any sale must be transparent,” Jazbec added. Debt in the euro zone considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, and is set to rise. John Fell, a second senior ECB official involved, said these bad loans presented a wider challenge. “The problem is bad loans is too often understood to be one that is limited to banks. But it is far wider, it affects the whole economy,” Fell said. It is usual for banks to sell old loans to investors, with individual packages sometimes topping 10 billion euros, but the ECB is concerned that this is skewed in favour of big buyers. “There are only about half a dozen buyers who can write a cheque for hundreds of millions of euros,” said Gifford West of DebtX, which runs a similar platform in the U.S., adding that packaging the loans into smaller bundles could widen the pool of buyers up to 1,000. Under the new platform contemplated by the ECB, which could be up and running early next year, the packet size could be cut to 10 million euros, attracting smaller buyers who may pay more. As well as an economic angle to the ECB’s blueprint, there is also a strong political dimension to challenging such big investors. Supporters say they played a critical role, for example, in buoying the flagging Irish property market, after its crash. But critics have dubbed them “vulture funds” and their power was a lightning rod in elections in Ireland this year when Sinn Fein secured more votes than the establishment parties for the first time. The left-wing party’s popularity was lifted by a housing crisis it partly blamed on fund investors crowding out the property market. And in Spain, the rising cost of housing, also attributed in part to the role of big investors, was an issue in elections last year, prompting Madrid to tighten tenant protection.

Ant Group to raise $17.5 billion via Hong Kong IPO without cornerstone investors - sources," HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Ant Group plans to raise about half of its $35 billion dual listing in Hong Kong and will not offer a cornerstone tranche as it bets on strong demand from institutional investors, sources said. Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Ant plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai’s STAR Market next month in what could be the world’s largest IPO, surpassing oil giant Saudi Aramco’s $29.4 billion float last December. The financial technology firm is seeking to raise about $35 billion after assessing early investor interest and based on a higher valuation of about $250 billion or more, Reuters has reported. Ant aims to sell 10-15% of its enlarged share capital, splitting the float evenly between Hong Kong and Shanghai, two of the sources said, requesting anonymity as the details were not yet public. Ant declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the details earlier on Wednesday. After receiving positive initial feedback from prospective investors including some existing shareholders, Ant has decided to push ahead with the Hong Kong leg without cornerstone investors, who usually buy significant chunks of a local IPO, said three of the people. While the cornerstone practice is common in several Asian markets and helps bolster demand for large deals, such investors generally tend to push for as low an IPO price as possible, denting issuers’ ambition for higher valuations. A high percentage of cornerstone investors would also sharply reduce post-listing trading volumes, as shares are locked up for at least six months in Hong Kong. Ant, which won approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the domestic IPO last week, plans to seek a listing hearing with the Hong Kong bourse in the coming days, said one of the people.",Business
First tanker to load crude at Libya's Hariga port since January," BENGHAZI/LONDON (Reuters) - An oil tanker is expected to load crude at Libya’s Marsa el-Hariga terminal this week, the first since a blockade by eastern forces in January slashed the OPEC member’s oil production to a trickle. The Delta Hellas tanker will enter Libya’s Hariga port on Wednesday and load 1 million barrels of oil from the port’s storage, the Arabian Gulf Oil Co which operates the port said in a statement. Eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar said last week his forces would lift their eight-month blockade of oil exports, which depressed the OPEC member’s production down to around 100,000 barrel per day (bpd). Trading arm of China’s Sinopec , Unipec- which prior to the blockade was one of the main lifters of Mesla and Sarir crude grades from the terminal- booked the tanker, two trading sources said. Unipec also booked the Marlin Shikoku tanker, which according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data is expected to arrive at Hariga on Thursday. This comes as the National Oil Corporation (NOC) seeks to gradually boost production, with output expected to rise to around 260,000 bpd next week. Before the blockade, Libya produced around 1.2 million bpd, or more than 1% of global production. NOC, which said it would only resume at ports and oilfields that are free of military presence, has so far announced oil export resumption from the Hariga, Brega and Zueitina terminals.",Business
Euro zone economic recovery in danger as services slide," LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth ground to a halt this month, throwing the economic recovery into question, as fresh restrictions to quell a resurgence in coronavirus infections slammed the services industry into reverse, a survey showed on Wednesday. The renewed downturn in the dominant services sector, which is likely to be hit harder by new constraints on activity imposed across the 19-country euro zone, more than offset the strongest manufacturing growth in two years. “Alarm bells should be going off about the pace of the recovery at the moment as the number of new COVID-19 cases has been flaring up,” said Bert Colijn at ING. “For governments and the European Central Bank, this will be a wake-up call, if they needed one.” IHS Markit’s flash Purchasing Managers’ Index sank to 50.1 in September from August’s 51.9, only just above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and well below the median forecast in a Reuters poll for a modest dip to 51.7. Tough lockdown measures to halt the spread of the virus brought economic activity to a virtual standstill at the height of the pandemic’s first wave in the spring. Most measures were relaxed as infection rates fell sharply and recent data have suggested the continent weathered the COVID-induced recession better than many feared. But Wednesday’s gloomy survey of private sector businesses suggested “the recovery is grinding to a halt, at least outside the German manufacturing sector”, said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics. “And with no sign the resurgence in virus cases has been stamped out, there is a clear and growing risk it goes into reverse, at least in the countries worst affected by the virus.” The flash PMI for the euro zone service industry plummeted to 47.6 from 50.5, significantly below the breakeven mark and falling short of even the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll that had predicted a reading of 50.5. Manufacturers fared much better, with the factory PMI climbing to a just over two-year high of 53.7 from 51.7 and a median forecast of 51.9. While services came in below all expectations, manufacturing was above all of them. The European Central Bank has already planned 1.35 trillion euros of pandemic-related asset purchases to support the economy and there is an historic 750 billion euro recovery fund from the European Union due to kick in next year. But a return to where the economy was before the outbreak is not expected until at least end-2022 and the new rise in coronavirus cases is the biggest threat to the recovering economy, according to a Reuters poll of economists. [ECILT/EU] Separate flash PMIs showed Germany’s private sector continued to recover this month but more slowly than expected. In France, the euro zone’s second biggest economy, activity slowed to a four-month low with services weaker than expected as the country struggled to contain a surge in new COVID-19 cases. In Britain, outside the currency union, the recovery from the lockdown lost some momentum as consumer-facing sectors suffered from the end of a government subsidy to support restaurants and more general COVID-related worries.",Business
Positive about flying? Airlines look to COVID tests that give results in minutes," ZURICH/MILAN (Reuters) - European airlines are pinning hopes on pre-flight COVID-19 tests that deliver results as fast as pregnancy tests to help restore passengers’ confidence in taking to the skies in confined spaces with shared air. Germany’s Lufthansa, at the mercy of government bailouts for survival, is in talks with Swiss drugmaker Roche over deploying so-called antigen tests, according to two people familiar with the discussions, as the airline aims to make them available next month. Italian operator Alitalia, meanwhile, told Reuters that from Wednesday it would add two flights from Milan to Rome, to the two it is already offering from Rome to Milan, exclusively for passengers with negative tests. The tests are administered by health authorities at the airports and included in ticket prices. If they prove popular and safe, these antigen-tested flights will be expanded to more domestic, and later international, routes, the airline said. Unlike laboratory-based molecular tests that have been the staple of health authorities in the pandemic, antigen tests do not require machines to process. Much like pregnancy tests, they can produce results in about 15 minutes. However the tests require an uncomfortable nasal swab and are not as accurate as the molecular, or PCR, tests. They generally produce more “false negatives” which could mean sick people could slip through the cracks and onto planes. An increasing number are hitting the market, from companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson & Co and Quidel Corp and Roche, which is rebranding antigen tests from South Korea’s privately held SD Biosensor. Airlines are pressing governments to embrace alternatives to blanket travel restrictions amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe. Rapid antigen tests that can be administered by non-medical staff are expected to become available in coming weeks for as little as $7 each, the head of industry body the International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday. Despite the drawbacks of such antigen tests, carriers hope they could tip the balance in convincing people to fly. “It is to give ... confidence, at a specific point in time, that the result is positive or negative,” said Christian Paulus, a Roche research and development manager. “The PCR remains the gold standard. Therefore if there are any questions open, or if the clinical appearance of the person who had a negative test, if the person has symptoms like a fever, then you would for sure do confirmatory testing.” Alitalia launched its “COVID Tested Flights” programme from Rome to Milan last week, and will expand it from Wednesday. Only passengers with negative COVID-19 results can board. “So far no positive passengers have been found,” said an Alitalia spokesman, adding that many chose to take the airline’s antigen tests the night before the flight. Travellers can access airport-testing facilities via a preferred lane with their tickets. The airline plans to analyse findings around the middle of October, but already expects antigen-tested flights will be expanded to domestic and later international routes. “First, we have to see how this experiment goes,” the spokesman said. The pre-flight antigen tests follow a scheme in Italy where such tests were used defensively. SD Biosensor said its tests had been deployed at Italian airports for incoming tourists, to avoid a renewed COVID-19 wave imported from infection hotspots. ‘BETTER THAN QUARANTINE’ Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr last week told employees during a townhall meeting that the airline was in talks with Roche. The drugmaker started selling the rapid tests this week, and said SD Biosensor could initially supply it with about 40 million tests per month. The Lufthansa tests could initially go to cabin crews, a spokeswoman said, though Bjoern Becker, a senior director of product management, ground & digital services for the Lufthansa Group, said the tests could also be made available to first-class and business-class passengers. “We think the tests would be a better option than putting somebody into quarantine,” the airline spokeswoman said. Beyond airlines, Germany is eyeing broader antigen test use from October, including in nursing homes where older patients have been hardest hit by the deadly virus. Regulators still worry about test accuracy, which typically detect the virus 80% to 90% of the time, below the 95% rate of lab tests. Still, some officials don’t want the perfect to be the enemy of the pretty good as they pursue some semblance of economic normality. “They’re good enough,” German health minister Jens Spahn said, pledging antigen tests in “significant quantities”. The state of Bavaria has already ordered 10 million.",Business
Exclusive: Hyundai discussing concessions with EU regulators over Daewoo deal - sources," BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world's biggest shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co Ltd 267250.KS is discussing concessions with EU antitrust regulators to allay concerns over its $1.8 billion bid for rival Daewoo 042660.KS, people familiar with the matter said. The deal, in part a response to overcapacity in the sector, would reinforce the South Korean company’s top position with a 21% market share, and comes as rivals in China and Singapore make inroads. The European Commission, which opened a full-scale investigation into the deal last December on concerns it could inflate prices and reduce competition in cargo shipbuilding, declined to comment. Hyundai was not immediately available for comment, while Daewoo declined to comment. Hyundai may face less onerous concessions after the EU competition enforcer dropped its concerns regarding the impact of the deal on the markets for large container ships, oil tankers and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers. It is now focusing solely on liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, one of the people said, which are used to transport LNG between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa. EU regulators typically favour asset sales or the transfer of technologies or contracts to rivals to address competition concerns. The Commission temporarily halted its probe on July 13, the third time it has done so. The previous two delays were due to the coronavirus crisis and also to it waiting for the companies to provide data. Much of the EU’s internal and external freight trade goes by sea, with European shipping companies major customers of Hyundai and Daewoo.",Business
"SEB dirty money problems 'not new', says Swedish FSA after TV show revelations"," STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s financial watchdog said on Wednesday that lender SEB’s past deficiencies regarding money-laundering were well known, after Swedish Television (SVT) aired a programme saying 8.2 billion Swedish crowns ($919 million) in suspicious funds had passed through the bank. SVT’s allegations were based on leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which were reported by U.S. and other media on Sunday. “The fact that there has been suspected illicit financial flows through SEB in the Baltic region is something that has been reported on...so in that sense this information is not new,” the FSA told Reuters. The Baltic scandal, first ensnaring Danske Bank and resulting in a record Swedish fine for Swedbank, lifted the lid on money flows from Russian and other non-resident clients into the European Union and elsewhere. “The information that (SVT’s) Uppdrag Granskning presents in its programme does not contain any news for the bank,” SEB said in a statement. SEB was fined 1 billion crowns by Sweden’s financial watchdog in June for failures in compliance and governance in relation to anti-money-laundering controls in the Baltics. “The scope in time on our part for the investigation was originally set for 2007-2019, but for a number of reasons...not least changes in the regulatory framework...that time frame was later limited to 2015-2019,” the FSA said. Shares in SEB were up 2.1% at 1141 GMT. “It doesn’t add much that is new. We talked about a relatively large number of suspicious transitions before,” said Andreas Hakansson, a senior analyst at Danske Bank. Hakansson added that the SVT programme did, however, contain some new details on names connected to suspected wrongdoing at SEB. Among others, SVT said SEB did business with a British company that was part of the so-called “Russian laundromat”, an alleged large-scale, Russian-led money laundering scheme reported by media in 2017. The FinCEN leaks reported by media on Sunday showed several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over a period of nearly two decades despite red flags about the origins of the money.

Hedge fund manager Alexander Klabin to invest in auction house Sotheby's," (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Alexander Klabin will invest in international art auction house Sotheby’s and become the executive chairman of its art financing business, the company said on Wednesday.

"Sensex, Nifty slide for fifth session as Airtel, TCS drag"," BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Wednesday for a fifth straight session as surging coronavirus cases fuelled investor concerns, with Bharti Airtel driving losses after rival Jio stepped up competition with new postpaid plans, while Tata Consultancy Services slid over 2%. The broader NSE Nifty 50 index slipped 0.2% to 11,131.85 and the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.17% to 37,668.42. Both the indexes have shed more than 3% so far this week. Shares of telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd fell as much as 10% to their lowest since April 3, after rival Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries, rolled out new postpaid plans on Tuesday bundled with video-streaming services. TCS fell as much as 4.5% after, Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group, the largest minority shareholder in Tata Group, said on Tuesday it wanted to separate interests from the autos-to-steel conglomerate. “Tatas have to make some back to back arrangements for raising money if they are parting ways with Shapoorji Pallonji and investors may be asked to contribute directly or indirectly,” said Deepak Jasani, head of research, HDFC Securities. Meanwhile, India’s coronavirus infections surged again on Wednesday. Britain re-imposed some lockdown measures as a second wave of coronavirus infections sweeps across Europe, while the death toll in the United States crossed 200,000. “As the fresh covid cases are rising day by day ... it is increasing tension among retailers as well as big players in the market,” said Rahul Sharma, head of research, Equity99 Advisors in Mumbai.

Tesco boss tells UK shoppers not to panic buy after new COVID curbs," LONDON (Reuters) - There is no need for shoppers to panic buy grocery supplies after Britain imposed new restrictions to stem a second wave of COVID-19, the boss of Tesco, the country’s biggest supermarket chain, said on Wednesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the British people on Tuesday to work from home where possible and ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a spike in the pandemic, with new restrictions lasting probably six months. That prompted speculation over whether there could be panic buying of groceries similar to that which stripped supermarket shelves bare in March and led to the rationing of certain items. However, Tesco Chief Executive Dave Lewis said there was no need as food supplies were plentiful. “The message would be one of reassurance. I think the UK saw how well the food industry managed last time, so there’s very good supplies of food,” he told Sky News on Wednesday. “We just don’t want to see a return to unnecessary panic buying because that creates a tension in the supply chain that’s not necessary. And therefore we would just encourage customers to continue to buy as normal.” Lewis said he did anticipate there would be some small increases in stockbuilding within UK homes. On Tuesday the CEO of Aldi UK, Britain’s fifth largest supermarket group, e-mailed customers to reassure them. “Our stores remain fully stocked and ask that you continue to shop considerately. There is no need to buy more than you usually would,” said Giles Hurley.",Business
"Spain's second-quarter GDP falls less than expected, still worst decline on record"," (Reuters) - The Spanish economy shrank less than previously reported in the second quarter, but the contraction was still the worst on record as the coronavirus pandemic brought the country to a halt, the national statistics office said on Wednesday. The economy contracted by 17.8% quarter-on-quarter and 21.5% year-on-year, compared with readings of 18.5% and 22.1% in an initial estimate released in late July. Spanish authorities imposed one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns to curb the pandemic from mid-March to late June, triggering one of the deepest recessions in the region. A 20.4% quarterly drop in household spending dragged the economy down, alongside a 22.1% drop in investment and a 33.4% decline in exports of goods and services. Retail and hospitality collapsed with a 39.6% drop, as travel restrictions and covid fears kept tourists away. Recent indicators have shown that the economy has partly recovered during the third quarter and should grow more than 10%, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said last week. Restrictions on travel have hampered the recovery of the tourism-dependent Spanish economy. August hotel-occupancy data showed tourism was still suffering, with bookings by Britons, the largest tourist group by nationality in Spain, dropping 91%. One of the rare sectors that contributed to the economy was agriculture, growing 3.6%. Public spending grew by 0.3%. Spain has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Western Europe, with over 682,000 infections and nearly 31,000 deaths as of Tuesday.",Business
German cabinet approves second-highest net new debt since World War Two in 2021 budget," BERLIN (Reuters) - The German cabinet on Wednesday approved Finance Minister Olaf Scholz’s draft budget for next year which envisages net new debt of 96.2 billion euros ($112.43 billion) to finance further measures to tackle the coronavirus crisis, an official said. The additional borrowing marks the second-highest amount of net new debt in Europe’s largest economy since the end of World War Two and comes after the government already took on record high borrowing of some 218 billion euros this year. The budget underlines Scholz’s determination to move Germany further away from its former image as Europe’s austerity champion and secure Berlin’s new role as the biggest spender in the euro zone’s struggle to recover from the coronavirus shock. The fiscal plans require Germany to suspend its constitutionally enshrined debt limits in 2021 after parliament already abandoned them this year. From 2022 onwards, Germany plans to stick to its debt brake rules again, limiting borrowing to a tiny fraction of gross domestic product. The government’s mid-term fiscal plans envisage net new debt of 10.5 billion euros in 2022, 6.7 billion euros in 2023 and 5.2 billion euros in 2024. This means Germany is not planning to return to its ultra-prudent fiscal policy of keeping a balanced budget. ($1 = 0.8557 euros)",Business
BOJ Kuroda says may extend deadline for aid to pandemic-hit firms," TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank was ready to extend its programmes aimed at easing corporate funding strains that expire early next year, as the coronavirus pandemic keeps the economic outlook highly uncertain. He also reiterated the BOJ’s resolve to work closely with the government in battling headwinds to Japan’s recovery such as the fallout from U.S.-China tensions and protectionism. “There’s a good possibility we will extend the deadline for the programmes if needed, depending on the impact of COVID-19,” Kuroda told a news conference after his online meeting with business leaders in Osaka, western Japan, on Wednesday. “We’ll make the decision at an appropriate timing and won’t wait until the last minute,” he added. The BOJ ramped up purchases of corporate debt and created a lending facility to pump money to firms hit by COVID-19, as part of efforts to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic. Both programmes end in March next year, unless the BOJ’s board votes to extend the deadline. “It’s true corporate funding remains tight. We’ll of course monitor developments carefully and take additional easing steps without hesitation if necessary,” Kuroda told the Osaka business leaders. “We’d like to continue supporting corporate funding, working closely with the government,” he said. Kuroda made the remarks after meeting Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga earlier in the day. It was their first meeting since Suga was elected as Japan’s new leader this month. With the immediate hit from the pandemic easing, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady last week and upgraded its view on the economy to say it was starting to pick up. Kuroda said the economy and prices were moving roughly in line with the BOJ’s latest forecasts made in July. But he warned that any economic recovery will be moderate with risks “skewed to the downside.” “The shock exerted by the pandemic could push down corporate and household growth expectations, making them cautious about spending. That’s something we need to look out for,” he said. Kuroda also said Japan’s consumer prices will likely keep falling for the time being due mostly to temporary discounts offered by the government to promote domestic tourism. “Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to turn positive thereafter and accelerate its pace of increase as the economy improves,” he added, shrugging off the view Japan could slip back into chronic deflation. Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as COVID-19 hit demand, reinforcing expectations inflation will remain well below the BOJ’s 2% target for years.",Business
Chevron asks employees to delete WeChat after U.S. ban - Bloomberg News," (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp CVX.N has asked employees globally to delete Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat from their work phones, following the Trump administration's executive order to ban the social media app, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. A U.S. judge on Sunday blocked a government order requiring Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O to remove WeChat for downloads on national security grounds. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it would challenge the order. WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines messaging, social media, payment functions and other services and boasts more than a billion users globally. Chevron, in a staff email, identified WeChat as a “non-compliant application” and asked those with the app on their work handsets to delete it before Sept. 27 or face disconnection from the company’s network, according to the Bloomberg report. Chevron and Tencent, which has denied its apps pose a national security risk, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The United States has launched a series of measures in recent months cracking down on Chinese tech firms and apps, as the world’s two largest economies butt heads on issues ranging from trade and technology to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Business
Tesla's value drops $50 billion as Musk's promised cheaper battery three years away," (Reuters) - Investors slashed $50 billion from Tesla Inc's TSLA.O market value on Tuesday despite CEO Elon Musk's promise to cut electric vehicle costs so radically that a $25,000 car that drives itself will be possible, but not for at least three years. Tesla’s market cap dropped $20 billion in just two hours after trading closed Tuesday, as Musk and other Tesla executives presented their new battery and manufacturing strategies. Shares closed down 5.6% and dropped another 6.9% after hours. “Nothing Musk discussed about batteries is a done deal,” said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin. “There was nothing tangible.” Investors had expected two significant announcements at Musk’s oft-touted “Battery Day”: The development of a “million mile” battery good for 10 years or more, and a specific cost reduction target -- expressed in dollars per kilowatt-hour -- that would finally drop the price of an electric vehicle below that of a gasoline car. Musk offered neither. Instead, he promised over the next several years to slash battery costs in half with new technology and processes and deliver an “affordable” electric car. “In three years . . . we can do a $25,000 car that will be basically on par (with), maybe slightly better than, a comparable gasoline car,” Musk said. Musk acknowledged that Tesla does not have its ambitious new vehicle and battery designs and manufacturing processes fully complete. Tesla has frequently missed production targets set by Musk. Tesla expects to eventually be able to build as many as 20 million electric vehicles a year. This year, the entire auto industry expects to deliver 80 million cars globally. Building an affordable electric car “has always been our dream from the beginning of the company,” Musk told an online audience of more than 270,000. Tesla on Tuesday also introduced a new Model S Plaid, a 520-mile range sedan that can reach top speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (320 km per hour), with deliveries starting in 2021. The Plaid was listed on Tesla’s website on Tuesday at a price of nearly $140,000. At the opening of the event, Musk walked on stage in a black t-shirt and jeans as about 240 shareholders -- each sitting in a Tesla Model 3 in the company parking lot -- honked their car horns in approval. To help drive down vehicle cost, Musk described a new generation of batteries that will be more powerful, longer lasting and half as expensive than the company’s current cells. Tesla’s new larger cylindrical cells will provide five times more energy, six times more power and far greater driving range, Musk said, adding that full production is about three years away. To help reduce cost, Musk said Tesla planned to recycle battery cells at its Nevada “gigafactory,” while reducing cobalt -- one of the most expensive battery materials -- to virtually zero. It also plans to manufacture its own battery cells at several highly automated factories around the world. Shares in two battery suppliers to Tesla, South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS and Japan's Panasonic Corp 6752.T, fell after the announcement. Tesla will produce the new battery cells initially on a new assembly line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, with planned output reaching 10 gigawatt-hours a year by the end of 2021. Tesla and partner Panasonic Corp 6752.T now have production capacity of around 35 gWh at the Nevada battery ""gigafactory."" Tesla aims to rapidly ramp up battery production over the next years, to 3 terawatt-hours a year, or 3,000 gigawatt-hours -- roughly 85 times greater than the capacity of the Nevada plant. Musk said Tesla could supply batteries to other companies. As automakers shift from horsepower to kilowatts to comply with stricter environmental regulations, investors are looking for evidence that Tesla can increase its lead in electrification technology over legacy automakers who generate most of their sales and profits from combustion-engine vehicles. While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle’s cost. Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh). Tesla’s battery packs cost $156 per kWh in 2019, according to electric vehicle consulting firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors.","World

Explainer: Foreign access to China's $16 trillion bond market," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Index provider FTSE Russell is set to decide on whether to include Chinese government bonds in its World Government Bond Index on Thursday, potentially opening the way for more foreign participation in China’s $16 trillion bond market. Below is an introduction to the market for foreign investors. Foreign institutional investors can access the exchange bond and interbank markets, China’s two main markets for bonds, through the dollar-denominated Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, and its yuan-denominated sibling, RQFII. China scrapped quotas for QFII and RQFII in June, to give qualified foreign institutions unlimited access to Chinese stocks and bonds. Some institutional investors, including foreign central banks and monetary authorities and sovereign wealth funds can register for direct access to the interbank market through China Interbank Market (CIBM) Direct. Bond Connect, introduced in July 2017, allows quota-free access to the interbank market through its “northbound” channel through Hong Kong. China has not launched a “southbound” channel, which would allow Chinese investors to invest in offshore bonds. Foreign holdings are concentrated in the following: - Chinese government bonds (CGBs) issued by the finance ministry. Foreigners held CGBs worth 1.6 trillion yuan ($236.13 billion) in August, 9.2% of the total. - Policy bank bonds, quasi-sovereign instruments issued by China Development Bank, Export-Import Bank of China and Agricultural Development Bank of China. Foreign holdings stood at 797.9 billion yuan in August, 4.6% of the total. - Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs), a short-term interbank debt instrument with tenors of up to one year. Foreign holdings were 210.2 billion yuan in August. - Medium-term notes, a corporate debt instrument. Foreign holdings were 89.4 billion yuan in August. The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) regulates the interbank market, under the auspices of the People’s Bank of China, with trading conducted through the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS). The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s state planner, regulates enterprise bonds, a corporate debt instrument. China Central Depository and Clearing Co (CCDC) and the Shanghai Clearing House are the central depositories. The exchange bond market is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Trading primarily takes place on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with China Securities Depository and Clearing Co as the central depository. Investors say China lags far behind its developed-market peers in liquidity, ease of trading and market access. Liquidity remains low as China’s banks, pension funds, insurance companies hold on to their inventory because they cannot engage in bond lending, said Eugenie Shen, managing director and head of ASIFMA’s Asset Management Group. Foreign investors have few hedging tools, such as access to bond futures, she said. China’s practice of charging trading fees separately, rather than building them into the spread, has been problematic for asset managers, but Shen said she expects to see progress on conforming to global practice this year.

Investors eye new haven in Chinese bonds as index decision looms," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a flurry of market reforms are creating an ideal backdrop for the possible inclusion of its government bonds in a major global index this week. Index provider FTSE Russell is widely expected to add Chinese government bonds (CGBs) to its flagship World Government Bond Index (WGBI) after an annual review on Thursday, a potentially major step for Chinese bonds as investors seek safe-haven assets in a zero-interest-rate world. “If China is included into WGBI, it indicates that it has passed FTSE Russell’s rigorous index inclusion criteria, particularly around market access and tradability,” said Danny Suwanapruti, rates strategist at Goldman Sachs. “This opens the doors for several global fixed income investors beyond index trackers, such as total return funds, multi-asset funds, DM bond funds and central banks.” China fumbled inclusion in last year’s WGBI review over long-standing investor concerns, in particular the poor liquidity, limited flexibility in foreign exchange settlement and tight bond settlement cycles. Since then, regulators have addressed many sticking points, simplifying regulations, scrapping quotas, extending trading hours and bringing market structures more in line with global norms, including a raft of measures in the past few weeks. “A couple of weeks ago, people would have thought inclusion is going to be a close call because there were still some outstanding issues,” said Suwanapruti. The recent changes have improved the chances of being included in the index, he said. Chinese government bonds are already becoming a part of the J.P Morgan and Bloomberg Barclays index suites. But the FTSE WGBI has a far larger passive band of investors following it. Goldman Sachs estimates there is $2.5 trillion of global cash following the WGBI, and China’s inclusion could drive $140 billion into mainland bonds. A WGBI inclusion would help to legitimise Chinese bonds for more investors, particularly as the People’s Bank of China keeps policy steady while the rest of the world is cutting rates. Hiroshi Yokotani, managing director of State Street Global Advisors, said Japanese investors seeking to diversify away from U.S. assets have begun to look at China as a possible destination, noting that “of course, investors are desperate for yields.” Ten-year CGBs yield 240 basis points more than their U.S. equivalents, and expectations of a strong yuan mean hedging costs are low. Foreign interest is rising. On Monday, the largest exchange-traded fund to invest purely in CGBs listed in Singapore.. It took foreigners 22 months to go from 1 trillion to 2 trillion, official data shows. Just fourteen months later, at the end of August, foreigners held Chinese bonds worth 2.8 trillion yuan ($412.61 billion), nearly 3% of all outstanding bonds, and 9.2% of CGBs. The structure of inflows has also shifted. In 2017, short-term debt instruments, such as certificates of deposit, made up a large proportion of inflows as “less sticky” investors bet on the yuan appreciating, said Min Dai, Morgan Stanley’s head of Asia ex-Japan macro strategy. There are now more mutual funds and pension funds investing primarily in bonds, Dai said. He expects foreigners to own around 20% of CGBs by the end of 2030. ($1 = 6.7861 Chinese yuan)","World

China investors bet on volatility as U.S. presidential election heats up," SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors in China are betting on a bumpy ride until the end of the U.S. presidential election and seeking to protect their assets from a long chill in Sino-U.S. ties. Global equity fund managers are shifting out of New York-listed shares in Chinese firms and into Hong Kong-listed vehicles to counter the risk of forced delistings, as both Democrat Joe Biden and Republican President Donald Trump promise a hard line on Beijing. And currency investors are fretting that a yuan hovering near 16-month highs is priced for a Biden win, and a calmer tone in diplomacy, which could swiftly unwind if Trump is victorious. Their bets are focused less on the outcome and more on what most expect to be a rollercoaster period until at least polling day on Nov. 3. “It doesn’t matter if Biden or Trump will be elected. The bipartisan consensus is to be tough on China,” said Chen Jiabeng, fund manager of Xiamen Portfolio Management Co, which helps investors allocate assets through funds of funds. “We will not bet on direction. We will bet on higher volatility,” he said. Chen is allocating some 30%-40% of his portfolio to funds with options and futures trading strategies that can profit from wild swings in underlying assets. A doubling in the volume of stock index option contracts traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in July, surpassing even March’s peak at the height of the coronavirus panic, and heavy volumes through August shows Chen is not alone. Adam Coons, portfolio manager of Indianapolis-based Winthrop Capital Management, plans shifting his stake in Alibaba BABA.N9988.HK from its New York listing to Hong Kong as a ""defensive move"", even though he thinks a U.S. delisting is unlikely. Even Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent 0700.HK have been hit by a Trump ban on U.S. downloads of its popular WeChat app. A lack of momentum in Chinese equity markets, which have moved sideways in Shanghai .SSEC and downwards in Hong Kong .HSI over recent weeks, belies shifts beneath the surface. “It’s the calm before the storm,” said Allen Mo, chief investment officer of Ming Yue Asset, a Chinese hedge fund that like Chen’s Xiamen is using derivatives to bet on volatility. The “smart money” in China is already pulling out of stocks, he said. “TREACHEROUS” China policy is a major campaign issue, regularly raised by both candidates on the stump and expected to feature in three scheduled televised debates, beginning on Sept. 29. To be sure, some fund managers think the campaign rhetoric and the election outcome matter little to the long-term trends that form the basis of their investments in China. “We are fully invested and are seeing green shoots arise in the Chinese economy,” said Sam Lecornu, chief executive of Stonehorn Global Partners in Hong Kong. “We see upside in markets as there’s ample liquidity in the system and central banks continue to drive real rates down.” Yet some China bulls are holding back for now. “Clients are very, very concerned about the next 50 days, which I think are very, very treacherous,” said Davis Hall, head of capital markets in Asia at Indosuez Wealth Management. “It seems like dollar/CNY is reflecting the probability of a Biden victory,” he said. “So what happens if we don’t get one? We could immediately give back a lot of this current move,” he said, advising investors long on yuan to trim their positions for safety.","World

KKR to invest $755 million in retail arm of Reliance," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc will invest $755 million in the retail unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, the Indian conglomerate said on Wednesday, bringing the total funding in Reliance Retail to $1.78 billion within a month. Reliance Industries, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, is lining up investors in its retail unit after the conglomerate raised just over $20 billion this year from global investors, including Facebook Inc, by selling stakes in its Jio Platforms digital business. The Mumbai-headquartered Reliance has approached investors in Jio Platforms about buying stakes in its retail arm, Reuters had reported. While Silver Lake, another one of Jio Platforms’ backers, said earlier this month it will invest $1.02 billion in Reliance Retail. KKR’s investment for a 1.28% stake in Reliance Retail values the company at 4.21 trillion rupees ($57 billion), Reliance said in a statement. “Retail, whether online or offline, is a very capital-intensive business, so for Reliance making sure that their retail venture has a funding pipeline of its own is important,” said Devangshu Dutta, the chief executive of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. KKR, which announced its biggest investment in Asia with a $1.5 billion stake buy in Jio Platforms in May, said it was deepening its relationship with Reliance. Reliance Retail is “empowering merchants of all sizes and fundamentally changing the retail experience for Indian consumers,” KKR co-founder Henry Kravis said in the statement. Reliance, already India’s biggest retailer with roughly 12,000 stores, forged a $3.38 billion deal last month to acquire rival Future Group’s retail business. The Indian conglomerate is also attempting to expand its so-called new commerce venture, which ties neighborhood stores to Reliance for online deliveries of groceries, apparel and electronics in a space currently dominated by Walmart Inc’s Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc’s Indian arm. “Anyone taking on the deep-pocketed Amazon and Walmart has to make sure they are equally well-capitalized,” Dutta said.

Indonesia starts developing controversial food estate project," JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has started developing a food estate to grow rice, corn and other crops that should eventually span the archipelago and aims to curb reliance on food imports in the world’s fourth most populous country, President Joko Widodo said on Wednesday. The project, which is spearhead by the president’s former rival turned minister Prabowo Subianto, is expected to cover an area of 770,000 hectares (1,903,000 acres), or more than ten times the size of Singapore. The estate will allocate 148,000 hectares to rice and 622,000 hectares of non-irrigated land for crops like maize, said the president, who is widely known as Jokowi. The food estate will be first located in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island and in North Sumatra, and will be extended to West Papua, East Nusa Tenggara and South Sumatra, Jokowi said in a televised cabinet meeting. “Infrastructure support and road access will also be carried out in the field immediately so that... large modern agricultural tools will not experience difficulties,” he said. Self-sufficiency in food, sometimes via ambitious projects, has long been a target for Indonesian politicians, given the country is a top importer of wheat and rice. In the case of rice, a high-profile attempt by former autocrat Suharto to restore Indonesia’s self-sufficiency in the 1990s under Central Kalimantan’s Mega Rice Project proved disastrous due to the ill-suited peat land. Green groups have also criticised the latest plan and warned of the risk that dried out peatland could trigger devastating forest fires. Defense minister Prabowo said after the announcement the project was needed now due to food scarcity warnings by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said the government wanted to “ensure that we don’t depend on foreign supplies”. Prabowo said the project would initially grow 30,000 hectares of cassava and this would rise to 1.4 million by the end of 2025 with its flour used as an ingredient of staples like bread and noodles.","World

Amazon launches climate-friendly program to help shop for sustainable products," (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, the world's biggest online retailer, announced the launch of a climate-friendly program on Wednesday to help customers shop for sustainable products, as part of its commitment to be net carbon neutral by 2040. Customers will now see more than 25,000 products ranging from grocery, household, fashion, beauty and personal electronics with a ‘Climate Pledge Friendly’ label, Amazon said in a statement. “With 18 external certification programs and our own Compact by Design certification, we’re incentivizing selling partners to create sustainable products that help protect the planet for future generations,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said. Amazon, which delivers about 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation and data center footprint, had faced protests from environmental activists and was under pressure from its employees to take action on climate change. The company had said in June it would launch the Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion venture capital fund that will invest in companies across industries to help reduce the impact of climate change and support sustainable development. Last year, Bezos had pledged to make Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from U.S. vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.","World

Old green power plants seek to regenerate as Germany turns off subsidies," FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Wilfried Haas owns a 3 kilowatt solar system which has been running as a micro power station since 1992, helping Germany, Europe’s largest economy, curb its dependence on coal and nuclear power. All that might be about to change. Together with thousands of other pioneer investors, Haas is considering whether he can continue his micro-generation without the subsidy scheme that helped to give Germany the highest level of installed renewable capacity in Europe. After the scheme begins to wind down at the start of next year, Germany in the worst case scenario would lose wind and solar energy equivalent to four nuclear power plants in 2021 alone, industry figures show. For now, it is unclear how any gap will be filled. Lobby groups on all sides are bickering as Berlin thrashes out an updated version of its renewable energy law. The government will discuss the latest draft on Wednesday. The legislation is needed because when policymakers limited German subsidies to 20 years in 2000, the country had yet to decide on its Energiewende - or shift from coal and nuclear power to renewable energy. Haas, 62, began his career in renewable generation before the government’s big policy change. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 prompted him to leave his job in industry and he set up a renewable project company GEDEA-Ingelheim in Ingelheim, west of Frankfurt. Once they became law, Haas benefited from the subsidies, known as feed-in tariffs, for selling renewable energy to the grid at about 50 cents per kilowatt hour. Without them, he faces earning no more than the wholesale power price of around of 2-4 cents. Protecting the environment was central, Haas said, and he hoped to continue operating his micro generation but it may cease to be economic if at any stage he faces a major repair bill. “In that case the financial burden would become too great, meaning that in the current regulatory framework continuing to operate it likely won’t pay off,” he said. Like other asset owners, he would have to decide whether to sell, upgrade or dismantle his generation capacity should Berlin fail to create a regulatory environment that makes it economic. In 2021, around 6,000 wind turbines with a capacity of about 4.5 gigawatts (GW) - enough to power 2.1 million households - will lose subsidy status. In addition, 18,000 solar plants, producing 75 megawatts, receive subsidies, industry figures show. Solar and wind stations contribute to making renewables account for 53% of Germany’s 222 GW total installed generation capacity, more than twice the capacity of Britain, Europe’s second-largest economy. “We need to be careful not to lose what we have achieved,” said Wolfgang Lemb, board member in charge of wind and solar at IG Metall, Germany’s biggest and most powerful trade union. “There must be more flexible regimes for repowering and ideas for how to continue operate old plants economically.” The big utilities have long complained the playing field is uneven, with fossil fuel generators arguing they should receive subsidies for providing reliable baseload, if renewable energy gets help. Another issue is that large utilities are unlikely to wish to buy any small-scale generation that might come up for sale from asset-owners who no longer wish to operate it. Utility companies are, however, interested in marketing roof-generated solar power on behalf of retail energy producers or in upgrading old wind farms. Norway’s Statkraft, for example, is seeking to arrange long-term contracts, referred to as power purchase agreements (PPA), between producers and energy users. “We do see a lot of potential for PPAs here, both for wind power plants that will see subsidies expire after 2020 and for new solar projects,” Sascha Schroeder, a vice president at Statkraft, said. E.ON, Germany’s largest energy company, said it would help owners of older plants install smart meters - which display supply and consumption - so they can more effectively use the power they generate. “At the same time, E.ON will take off excess electricity as a direct marketer and the customer benefits from an annual credit or insurance for their PV-systems (photovoltaic),” a spokesman said. A decline in the cost of storage batteries could also help. Marion Noeldgen, who leads the German business of Scandinavian power start-up Tibber, which sells green retail power, said peer-to-peer selling of excess solar power was already an established business in Norway and Sweden. “We have to see how that could be attractive for clients in Germany, because of course the market price is significantly below the feed-in tariff,” she said. “However, it is technically possible.”","World

Asian suppliers' shares slip on Tesla's cheaper battery plan," SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares of Asian battery suppliers fell on Wednesday after Tesla Inc TSLA.O outlined a plan to halve the cost of its electric vehicle batteries and bring more production of the key auto component in-house. The fortunes of battery makers in South Korea, Japan and China are linked to Tesla, the EV market leader, as they supply its factories in Nevada and Shanghai. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday the carmaker aims to lower electric vehicle prices to $25,000 each by producing new batteries with cheaper costs and longer range. Musk said that it will take about three years to fully achieve this goal-- disappointing investors and wiping $50 billion off its market value -- but analysts said plans for in house production would put pressure on suppliers to lower prices. “Tesla will have more power in negotiating prices and therefore overall battery costs will fall further,” said Rho Woo-ho, an analyst at Meritz Securities. Shares in South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS finished 1.4% lower after falling as much as 5.5% while Panasonic 6752.T ended down 3.7% and China's CATL 300750.SZ was down 1.7%. A Panasonic spokeswoman said the company is “considering a variety of options” when asked if Panasonic would partner with Tesla on new cell production, but added that nothing has been determined at this time. “We value our relationship with Tesla and look forward to enhancing our partnership,” the company said. LG Chem declined to comment. A source familiar with the company said it is open to cooperating with Tesla on the new batteries. CATL said in a statement it also planned research and investment in nickel rich chemistry, large cells and integrated structure, which are part of Tesla’s technology development roadmap, and saw them as key factors in making electric vehicles mainstream. ‘INSANELY DIFFICULT’ Tesla said it plans to achieve 100 gigawatt hours of internal battery capacity in 2022 and 3,000 gigawatt hours by 2030 -- roughly 85 times greater than the capacity of its Nevada plant by 2030. “This 100 gigawatt hours are supplemental to what we buy from suppliers,” Musk said, reiterating that Tesla will continue to use its existing cell suppliers. Tesla currently produces batteries in partnership with Panasonic at its Nevada factory, while LG Chem and CATL supply cells to its Shanghai factory. Tesla said it has started ramping up production of its new batteries at a pilot line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, but the production yield is not high. “It is insanely difficult to scale up,” Musk said at the company’s closely watched “Battery Day” presentation. “There is a clear path to success but a ton of work to do,” he said. Experts had mixed responses over whether Tesla will be able to live up to its aim of mass producing the bigger new batteries. ""Tesla's new batteries are possible at lab levels, but mass production is impossible,"" said Cho Jae-phil, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked previously at Korean battery maker, Samsung SDI 006400.KS. However, South Korean battery expert and professor Park Chul-wan was more optimistic. “Once Tesla succeeds in mass-producing the new cells, other battery vendors will find it difficult to catch up. It will be difficult to imitate the technology,” he said.","World

Singapore's deflation extends to seventh month in core gauge," SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s main price gauge contracted for the seventh consecutive month in August, data showed on Wednesday, with prices falling 0.3% from a year earlier. Core inflation - the central bank’s favoured price measure - was expected to fall 0.4% based on eight economists’ forecasts. The gauge had fallen 0.4% in July after entering negative territory in February for the first time in a decade. Singapore’s headline consumer price index was down 0.4% from a year earlier, unchanged from the prior month, data from the trade ministry and the Monetary Authority of Singapore showed. Economists had forecast a 0.5% drop. Authorities in the city-state, battling its deepest ever recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic, expect core and headline inflation to average between -1% and 0% in 2020.","World

Fujifilm's Avigan shown to be effective in Japanese Phase-3 trial for COVID-19," TOKYO (Reuters) - Fujifilm Holdings Corp said on Wednesday a late-stage study of its antiviral drug Avigan showed it reduced recovery times for COVID-19 patients with non-severe symptoms, boosting expectations for regulatory approval in Japan. The Phase 3 clinical study of 156 patients in Japan showed that those treated with Avigan improved after 11.9 days, versus 14.7 days for a placebo group. Results of the study, conducted by subsidiary Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, were statistically significant, the company said in a release. The announcement sent Fujifilm shares up more than 4% in Tokyo to their highest level in four months. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had touted Avigan’s potential as Japan’s contribution to a global race for coronavirus treatments, aiming for domestic approval in May. The government called on Fujifilm to triple national stockpiles of Avigan, approved in 2014 as an emergency flu treatment, and pledged to donate it to countries on request. But a lack of patients in Japan hampered clinical testing. In July, researchers at Fujita Health University said their Avigan study failed to reach statistically significant results. In its statement, Fujifilm said it would perform further analysis of the trial data and seek to file for approval of Avigan for use in COVID-19 as early as October. This week, the Nikkei newspaper cited ministry sources as saying approval could be granted within a month of receiving such a request. In July, Fujifilm sold its global rights to Avigan to India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. Already available generically in many countries under the name favipiravir, the drug has been approved to treat COVID-19 in India and Russia. Avigan acts on the RNA of viruses, inhibiting their ability to replicate. It is the subject of dozens of trials worldwide, but concerns remain over birth defects it caused in animal studies. Dr Reddy’s shares were 0.7% higher at 0430 GMT.","World

Exclusive: Mexico to hold off on possible new energy reform until next year - sources," MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s president asked regulators on Tuesday to help strengthen state oil firm Pemex and power company CFE using existing laws, but added he could seek energy reforms next year if required to meet his goals, two sources said. The sources, who were at the closed-door meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity, said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called on energy regulators to avoid issuing permits that would prevent private competitors to Pemex and CFE from expanding their footprint in the country. During the session at the national palace, the leftist energy nationalist expressed his wish to provide tax breaks and refinance the massive debt loads of the state-run energy giants, formally known as Petroleos Mexicanos and Comision Federal de Electricidad, the sources said. Pemex is the world’s most indebted oil company, with about $100 billion in financial debt. The president’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lopez Obrador, nearing the end of his second year in office, expressed a clear preference for the government to play a central role in the domestic energy markets, even describing a market-based approach as dangerous. “He said the free market is like ‘a fox guarding the hen house’ and that what we need to do is have the regulators and the government give the market to the state companies so that they can run the market,” the first source said. The energy regulators at the meeting included the National Hydrocarbons Commision, or CNH, the Energy Regulatory Commission, or CRE, as well as the sector’s safety and environment regulator, known as ASEA. All were designed to be independent. The regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment after hours. Lopez Obrador, a sharp critic of the 2013 constitutional overhaul enacted by his centrist predecessor that ended Pemex’s monopoly, told the regulators he would hold off from seeking a counter-reform to undo the changes. “Not right now, but the door is open,” said the other source, but only after the June midterm elections next year. The source said the president expressed a desire to “avoid for now giving permits” to private retail fuel companies. It was unclear whether he favors new limits on permits for other private energy firms. The president said that CFE’s power should have preference over private generators when electricity is dispatched to the national grid, despite current law, which privileges lower-cost supplies without playing favorites. According to the first source, Lopez Obrador appeared to cast privately owned wind and solar power producers as seeking to displace the CFE. “He said that the issue of clean energy was sophistry, and actually intended to weaken and finish off the CFE,” the source said.","World

"TikTok's promise of 25,000 new U.S. jobs sets lofty goal"," (Reuters) - Even as dealmakers bicker over who will actually own TikTok Global, another question emerged after President Donald Trump agreed over the weekend to keep the wildly popular video-sharing app running in the United States for another week: how can they possibly create 25,000 new jobs in the United States? That vow, repeated by the president on Saturday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, was part of a concession that dealmakers offered to convince Trump to green-light a transaction in which a new board comprised of U.S. citizens would oversee a new U.S.-based company and co-owned by Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc. But the lofty hiring target will be tough to justify, experts said. Such a high number suggests an expectation for massive revenue growth at a time when TikTok faces unprecedented global challenges. If TikTok operated at anywhere near the efficiency of other internet companies such as Twitter, TikTok would need to generate up to 19 times more revenue over the next few years. TikTok is expected to generate about a billion dollars in revenue by the end of 2020, Reuters previously reported. Many of the new American jobs will likely be in engineering, content moderation and security roles, given the U.S. government’s intense focus on the app’s data privacy policies, said Dan Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities. “From a security and infrastructure perspective, they’re going to have to hire a few thousand alone to focus on that issue...given the sensitivity,” he said. TikTok recently announced a $1 billion creator fund that will pay popular TikTok influencers for making videos. Counting those content creators would help TikTok reach 25,000 jobs, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM. Beyond that, it gets harder to justify a bigger staff. Because ByteDance will still own the algorithm that runs TikTok and license it to the new U.S.-based company, the new company will not need to hire large teams that work on artificial intelligence. Those types of jobs account for a large chunk of Facebook Inc and Twitter’s headcount, said Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a technology and geopolitics consulting firm, raising questions about what job roles TikTok could hire for. Oracle and Walmart could also create divisions within their companies to serve TikTok that could contribute to the job count, he added. A source familiar with the deal discussions said the 25,000-job figure was based on similarly sized organizations that serve as many users as TikTok, without offering details. The source added that the job figure was actually conservative in an effort to under-promise and over-deliver. Another tech company, Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, promised in 2017 to bring 13,000 new jobs to Wisconsin. The deal to create a new factory in the United States was praised by Trump as the “eighth wonder of the world” and as proof of his ability to bring jobs back to America. A filing with the Wisconsin state economic development division showed Foxconn employed about 600 people in 2019 in the region, according to a CNBC report. The ambition of TikTok’s hiring goals can better be understood by comparing it against the revenue that workers make for other internet companies. On average, Twitter’s 4,800 workers each generated close to $720,000 or total annual revenue of $3.5 billion in 2019. Snap Inc’s 3,195 workers each generated about $537,000, for a 2019 annual sum of $1.7 billion. ByteDance currently employs more than 1,000 workers in the United States, mostly in California with some in other locations such as Texas, Reuters previously reported. At similar efficiency levels, TikTok’s new total of 26,000 U.S. workers would be expected to make between $14 billion to $19 billion annually. Even at the low end, such revenue targets will be difficult for TikTok, Prakash said. “We’re in a different phase of TikTok...that comes with a lot of baggage,” he said, adding TikTok is still banned in India, which was previously its largest market. “It’s going to take them that much longer and be that much harder to reach 14x (revenue).”","World

New Zealand central bank holds rates but hints at further easing," WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand’s central bank held its official cash rate at a record low on Wednesday but hinted at further easing and warned the economy may need support for a long time as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to hold the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 0.25% was in line with the unanimous expectations of economists in a Reuters poll. However, the RBNZ’s warning of job losses and business closures in its commentary cemented expectations that it would move to negative rates, which sent the New Zealand dollar down 0.3%. “The Reserve Bank of New Zealand continued to set the stage for negative rates today and we think the OCR will be cut into negative territory early next year,” said Ben Udy, analyst at Capital Economics. The bank also retained its large scale asset purchase (LSAP) programme at NZ$100 billion ($66.2 billion), as announced in August. The RBNZ said in its statement that further stimulus may be needed and that it was prepared to use additional tools like a Funding for Lending Programme (FLP), a negative OCR, and purchases of foreign assets. “Members agreed that monetary policy will need to provide significant economic support for a long time to come to meet the inflation and employment remit, and promote financial stability,” RBNZ said in a post-meeting statement. The central bank said the FLP, a low-interest loan programme for banks, would be ready before the end of this year. The dovish meeting comes as expectations grow that neighbouring Australia may also need to cut interest rates as soon as next month. The RBNZ stunned markets earlier this year with a 75 basis point cut in an emergency meeting in March as COVID-19 broke out across New Zealand. New Zealand fell into its deepest economic recession on record in the second quarter, data showed last week, although the contraction was slightly less severe than analysts had expected. The RBNZ said the ongoing virus-led activity restrictions, especially during a second wave of infections in Auckland, continued to dampen economic activity, and business and consumer confidence.

China's Ant takes another step towards $35 billion IPO with registration move," SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Ant Group submitted documents to the securities regulator for registration of the Shanghai portion of its IPO, the city’s bourse said late on Tuesday, moving a step closer to a planned dual-listing expected to be worth about $35 billion. The financial technology firm, backed by China's biggest e-commerce company Alibaba Group BABA.N, plans to list simultaneously on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market and in Hong Kong, in what sources have said could be the world's largest IPO and come as soon as October. The Shanghai Stock Exchange approved the listing plan last week. The company is seeking to raise about $35 billion in the IPO after assessing early investor interest and based on a higher valuation of about $250 billion or more, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Ant declined to comment. Separately, five Chinese asset managers said in their respective statements they would start raising up to 60 billion yuan ($8.83 billion) combined from Friday for mutual funds that would participate in Ant’s IPO as strategic investors. The fundraising period is two weeks, and each fund, with a lock-in period of 18 months, aims to raise up to 12 billion yuan. The money managers behind the funds are China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC), E Fund Management Co, Penghua Fund Management Co, China Universal Asset Management Co and Zhong Ou Asset Management Co. Ant said in its updated prospectus released late on Tuesday that several existing mutual fund products will also participate in its IPO share placement as strategic investors.","World

Sony slides 2% as Microsoft flashes cash to boost games lineup," TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp’s shares slid as much as 2% in Tokyo trade on Wednesday after Microsoft Corp said it would buy the parent of games publisher Bethesda Softworks, in a deal to bolster its games slate as it eyes cloud gaming expansion. Sony’s PlayStation 5 is expected by analysts to outsell Microsoft’s next-generation Xbox consoles when the devices launch in November, bolstered by Sony’s stronger games pipeline including exclusives like “Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.” Microsoft’s $7.5 billion acquisition of the publisher behind hit franchises like “Doom” and “Fallout” helps close that gap, as it pushes into cloud gaming with the launch of a subscription service last week for Android devices. The Xbox Game Pass is central to Microsoft’s counterattack, with the rival PlayStation Now service from Sony - which has a dominant hardware install base - seen as lagging in terms of games on offer and by being limited to PlayStation and PC. It will take time for the deal to feed through to Xbox’s games pipeline, with Bethesda contracted to bring titles “Deathloop” and “Ghostwire: Tokyo” to PlayStation 5. The concentration of studios in the hands of established players puts clear blue water between a wave of challengers like Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc that are moving into gaming but lack killer titles. “Given the expansion of streaming services as we enter the era of next-gen consoles, we expect this industry consolidation to continue,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note. Japan’s markets reopened on Wednesday after national holidays. Sony’s shares have risen by almost half since March lows as the gaming industry benefits from demand brought about by stay-at-home policies during the coronavirus outbreak.","World

"Asian business confidence rebounds sharply, pandemic casts shadow - Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey"," BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Business sentiment among Asian firms rebounded in the third quarter as easing coronavirus restrictions lifted sales but lingering uncertainty over the pandemic thwarted a return to business-as-usual, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed. Asian firms’ outlook for the next six months tracked by the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index jumped to 53 in the third quarter from an 11-year low of 35 in the second, according to the survey of 103 companies across 11 Asia-Pacific countries. It was also higher than the 50-point mark, which indicates a positive outlook. The survey comes as the easing of coronavirus restrictions across Asia has reduced pressure on hard-hit economies, though the experience has varied across the region, with some still in recession and others, like China, seeing a steady recovery. More than two-thirds of the companies polled said they saw the pandemic, or a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases, as a top risk. About 14% said a global recession was their biggest concern, while the rest flagged uncertainty over the upcoming U.S. election in November and other risks. “We’re recovering with a large dose of uncertainty,” said Antonio Fatas, an economics professor at global business school INSEAD in Singapore. “If it was just because of Asia, I think the numbers would be more positive but the reality is the world is not just Asia,” he said, pointing to greater uncertainty in Europe and the United States. The United States has reported the greatest number of COVID-19 fatalities, while rising numbers in Europe are now threatening to shut down parts of the continent again. Some 28% of companies in the third quarter were positive about their outlook, the survey showed, up sharply from 7.6% in the second quarter. About 60% of the firms polled said they did not hire or lay off people this quarter, in contrast to the second quarter’s survey in which 63% said they had cut jobs. Companies polled included Australia-listed Oil Search, Indian motorcycle maker Hero MotoCorp and Japanese car maker Suzuki Motor Corp. The survey was conducted between Aug. 31 and Sept. 14. While countries in Asia have had mixed success in containing the coronavirus and its fallout on their economies, the Asian Development Bank expects output in the region to shrink for the first time in nearly six decades this year. China, where the coronavirus was first detected, has largely managed to contain its spread and South Korea and Japan have kept case numbers relatively low by global standards despite all three countries seeing a second wave of infections. But elsewhere in the region the outbreak is worsening. India, for instance, has reported the second-highest number of cases globally. Indeed, some investors are shunning Asia’s riskier, high-yielding markets, despite the ample liquidity pumped into the financial system by central banks globally this year. Satish Shankar, the Asia-Pacific managing partner of business consultancy Bain & Company, said many companies in the region would “need to fundamentally transform their business models” to survive. But he added that Asia’s economic rebound would be “strongly linked” to the recovery in the Chinese economy. China expanded 3.2% in the second quarter, and looks set to grow this year. Some China-based firms in the survey said the upcoming U.S. election was their primary worry alongside COVID-19. The U.S. government is threatening to delist Chinese companies that do not meet U.S. accounting standards while Washington has cracked down on Chinese tech firms amid worsening relations between the world’s two largest economies. Grant Pan, chief financial officer of Chinese wealth manager Noah Holdings, which is listed in the United States, said the firm was looking at “possible alternatives as a safety net, including the Hong Kong and Chinese capital market”. Noah Holdings was among the companies surveyed. Note: Companies surveyed can change from quarter to quarter.","World

"Asian stocks struggle to build on Wall Street gains, dollar rises"," SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asia’s stock markets struggled to emulate Wall Street’s rebound on Wednesday as persistent worries about the global economic recovery kept investors cautious, while ebbing inflation expectations helped the U.S. dollar to a two-month high. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was steady after two days of declines, but the mood was hardly bullish. Japan's Nikkei .N225 returned from a two-day holiday to drop 0.6%. Markets in Shanghai .SSEC and Hong Kong .HSI opened flat, the ASX 200 <.AXJO rose 1.6% and South Korea's Kospi .KS11 fell 0.8% on a jump in coronavirus infections. “I think that reflects a lingering caution. The pandemic is still a concern...non-tech stocks are still weighed down by COVID-19,” said Bank of Singapore analyst Moh Siong Sim. Foreign exchange markets best reflected those worries and a strong dollar kept Asia’s currencies on the back foot, extending gains that had begun with hawkish remarks from a senior U.S. Federal Reserve official overnight. [FRX/] The greenback has busted out of a downtrend that started in March and it rose 0.2% against a basket of currencies =USD to its highest since late July. It gained by the same margin against the euro and yen and a little further against the Aussie to hit a six-week peak. The kiwi NZD=D3 flickered higher after the central bank left rates on hold, as expected, but pressure soon returned. “There looks to be a squeeze on dollar shorts,” said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow, with jitters in the equity markets, a stalling euro and no new stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep it under pressure. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, due to become a voter on the Federal Open Market Committee in 2021, said overnight the Fed still needed to discuss its new inflation approach but it “could start raising rates before we start averaging 2%.” That crimped inflation expectations, lifted U.S. real yields and set the dollar rising. The drop and partial recovery of U.S. stocks this week has lacked an immediate trigger though geopolitics, economics and virus news has given investors plenty to worry about. China-U.S. tensions are simmering, Britain has re-imposed some curbs on restaurants to try and head off a second wave of coronavirus infections and the U.S. election campaign seems to be distracting Congress from passing further aid bills. Wall Street's Tuesday rebound was led by a 1.7% gain in the Nasdaq .IXIC as a broker upgrade lifted Amazon.com AMZN.O by nearly 6%. The Dow and S&P 500 made more muted gains of 0.5% and 1% respectively. Futures trade suggests there is not much conviction behind the bounce, with S&P 500 ESc1 futures wobbling either side of flat in Asia and Nasdaq 100 futures NQc1 down 0.5%. “Care must be taken not to unthinkingly chartacterise this equity bounce back as ‘risk on’. It is not,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. “At best it is a mixed bag. More likely it was technical buying of dips.” U.S. President Donald Trump told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that China must be held accountable for having “unleashed” COVID-19, prompting Beijing to accuse him of “lies” and abusing the U.N. platform to provoke confrontation. Another flashpoint, the TikTok deal, is also flaring, with state-backed newspaper China Daily on Wednesday calling the Oracle and Walmart agreement to take stakes in the app “dirty and unfair” and cast doubt on whether it would win Beijing’s support. In commodity markets, oil prices slipped after a surprise rise in U.S. crude inventories. Brent futures LCOc1 were last down 0.9% at $41.34 a barrel and U.S crude futures CLc1 were down 1% at $39.41 a barrel.

Paytm executive says India's secondary listing plan would be undue burden," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s potential plan to compel companies to do a secondary listing on an Indian stock exchange if they opt to first list on an overseas bourse would unfairly penalise Indian firms, according to a senior executive at fin-tech company Paytm. ""Companies should be allowed to list wherever they want. I think that would be good not just for the companies, but for the digital ecosystem,"" Madhur Deora, a president of SoftBank-backed 9984.T Paytm, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. Deora’s comments come as India works on forging rules that would open the doors for Indian startups to list overseas and access deeper capital pools. Earlier this month however, Reuters reported that New Delhi is also considering mandating an Indian secondary listing for any Indian company that opts to first list abroad, a move investors fear will harm valuations. “I would have preferred for that (decision) to be left to companies and their boards,” said Deora. “This (idea) would complicate our lives.” Companies like Google GOOGL.O that vie against Paytm in the digital payments space have no such obligation, noted Deora. “The fact that we are Indian and we are domiciled in India - that should not create additional obligation for us,” he said. Paytm, which also counts Chinese tech giant Alibaba BABA.N and Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N among its backers, expects to become profitable within 12 to 18 months, said Deora, a former investment banker who joined the startup in 2016. One of India's most valuable startups, Paytm began a decade ago as a platform for mobile recharges but it now sells things ranging from flight tickets to mutual funds. It competes with Google Pay, Walmart's WMT.N PhonePe and Amazon Pay in India's digital payments market, which is set to more than double in value to $135 billion by 2023 from 2019. “We want to go public only as a profitable company,” Deora said without specifying a timeline for a listing.","World

Brazil rejects that EU-Mercosur deal could increase Amazon destruction," BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s government said on Tuesday it disagrees with claims that a European Union-Mercosur trade deal would increase destruction in the Amazon rainforest and criticized French concerns about an agreement as “protectionist.” In a joint note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, Brazil took issue with a report on deforestation used by the French government last week to oppose the current version of the EU-Mercosur trade deal. The report, which Brazil said was commissioned by the French government, “reveals the real protectionist concerns of those who commissioned it when dealing with the agricultural concessions made by the EU to Mercosur,” Brazil’s note said. Brazil’s statement came after Augusto Heleno, a national security adviser to President Jair Bolsonaro, told local radio station Bandeirantes the country could retaliate with its own trade blocks against countries that boycotted Brazilian goods on environmental grounds. A trade deal would instead, according to the Brazilian statement, reinforce multilateral commitments and best practices on the environment. The EU has been holding talks with the Mercosur group of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the world’s fourth-largest trade bloc. One worry has been the impact of the future deal on forests and the climate. Bolsonaro has been under international scrutiny for his environmental policies. Earlier on Tuesday, he defended his environmental record at the United Nations.","World

Japan's SBI wants to shake up regional banks. It may get a Suga boost," TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese financial firm SBI Holdings Inc has ambitions to revive struggling regional banks by taking stakes and pushing them into higher-margin businesses - a strategy that may get a boost from the country’s new prime minister. Although regional lenders are dominant outside of Tokyo and other big cities, many are tied to areas where the population is ageing rapidly, and business has been hollowed out. The pandemic has deepened the pain after years of low-margin lending. Yoshihide Suga has pledged to strengthen local economies and encourage regional banks to consolidate, a shakeup that many say is long overdue. “If the government is going to focus on revitalising local economies, there absolutely will be a business opportunity in that,” SBI Chief Executive Yoshitaka Kitao said in an interview. Kitao spoke to Reuters before Suga announced his intention to run as leader of the ruling party to replace Shinzo Abe. SBI has so far invested in four regional banks, and Kitao says he wants to expand that to 10. The remaining six tie-ups should come by the end of the financial year, he told Reuters. If Suga pushes to revive local economies, regional banks could benefit, said Natsumu Tsujino of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “Under such circumstances, SBI’s framework would be more attractive for regional banks, and that could be a tailwind for SBI,” she said. “There are a lot of regional banks, and some of them don’t seem to have changed very much,” Suga told Reuters in an interview last month, while still chief cabinet secretary. Without prompting, Suga mentioned SBI’s CEO, saying: “I hear many regional banks are going to see Mr Kitao”. The two are close, according to one source. Suga has asked Kitao for help with regional banks, Kyodo news agency reported. SBI declined to comment on Kitao’s relationship with Suga or how the company could benefit under the new administration. Founded in 1999, SBI was the financial unit of SoftBank Group until the tech firm exited in 2006. SBI owns an online bank, an asset manager and Japan’s largest online brokerage. Kitao says he wants to create the fourth-biggest banking force in Japan, behind “megabanks” such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. His strategy is to use regional banks to expand SBI’s customer base, said Brian Waterhouse of Windamee Research, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform. “He is not trying to rescue the banking industry or save regional banks. He sees this as an opportunity to expand his empire,” Waterhouse said. Smaller cities have plenty of wealthy people, many of whom don’t know how to invest, especially in riskier assets with potentially higher returns, Kitao said. Combined net profits of regional banks tumbled 40% in the last four years, according to the country’s Financial Services Agency. Yet regional lenders still account for nearly half of all bank deposits in Japan, holding some 368 trillion yen ($3.5 trillion) in cash deposits, according to central bank data. For Shimane Bank, in the western part of the main island, SBI’s 34% stake has meant a “dramatic change” in how it invests, a spokesman said. Profits from its securities portfolio improved after it invested with SBI Asset Management, which has connections with global fund managers such as BlackRock Inc, the spokesman said. Chikuho Bank, on the southern island of Kyushu, has been able to tap an SBI investee company, BASE, to help build e-commerce sites for its customers, something the bank couldn’t do itself, a spokesman said. “The biggest advantage from the alliance has been SBI’s connection with technology firms,” the spokesman said. SBI had a 2.9% stake in Chikuho as of March, according to Refinitiv data. Fukushima Bank, which is 19% owned by SBI, has teamed up with an SBI-owned staffing company to help its customers secure workers. The bank, a distant third in the prefecture, needs to expand beyond traditional lending, a representative said. As Japan’s population falls and market shrinks, some banks may not want to merge, said Windamee’s Waterhouse. “For these banks who are looking for more capital and rescue, Kitao is perhaps the only option at the moment.” ($1 = 104.4800 yen)","World

Japan factory activity struggles to recover as output falls: PMI," TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s factory activity extended declines in September largely due to a sharper fall in output, as the world’s third-largest economy struggles to stage a robust recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was largely unchanged at 47.3 in September compared with a final 47.2 in the previous month. Output contracted at a faster pace for the first time in four months, weighing on the headline index, which remained below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 17th month. “New order inflows continued to fall in September, reflecting subdued demand,” said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. “That said, the picture of the economy remained much improved when compared to the height of the pandemic during the second quarter.” While still remaining in contraction, other indicators in the manufacturing survey such as new orders and suppliers’ delivery times saw their slowest pace of declines since January. Other positive signs in the survey included manufacturers’ views on future output, which rose to a more than two year high. Japan’s new prime minister Yoshihide Suga faces the daunting task of restoring the economy after it posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter. Suga is expected to first target quick policy wins that will later give him the political capital to pursue tougher reforms. The PMI survey also showed a slight improvement in service-sector activity in September, which contracted at its slowest pace in seven months. The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI index rose to a seasonally adjusted 45.6 from the previous month’s final of 45.0. The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, edged up to 45.5 from a final 45.2 in August.","World

Venezuela launches London appeal in battle for $1 billion in gold," LONDON (Reuters) - The Nicolas Maduro-backed Venezuelan central bank launched a landmark appeal in London on Tuesday over $1 billion (£785.21 billion) of gold reserves held in the Bank of England’s underground vaults. The Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) board controlled by the Maduro government is challenging a High Court ruling in July that the UK government “unequivocally” recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president, therefore giving him control over the gold. Lawyers representing the BCV say selling the gold, which amounts to around 15% of Venezuela’s foreign currency reserves, would fund the response to the coronavirus and bolster a health system gutted by six years of economic crisis. Guaido’s lawyers say the bullion is his to control as the British government, along with around 60 others around the world, recognise him as leader after claims Maduro rigged Venezuela’s last presidential election two years ago. The hearing is expected to last three days and will be the first time such a tug-of-war has been conducted in the London Court of Appeal. BCV board solicitor Sarosh Zaiwalla said in a statement the case raises a number of issues of international law, which forbids the interference by any country in the internal affairs of another. The outcome could also present “a further threat to the international perception of English institutions as being free from political interference, as well as the Bank of England’s reputation abroad as a safe repository for sovereign assets”. Over the past two years, Maduro’s government has removed some 30 tonnes of gold from its local reserves in Venezuela to sell abroad for much-needed hard currency. Britain in early 2019 joined dozens of nations in backing Guaido, head of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress, after he declared an interim presidency and denounced Maduro as an usurper. Guaido, at the time, asked the Bank of England to prevent Maduro’s government from accessing the gold, which the opposition claims Maduro wants to use to pay off his foreign allies. In May, BCV sued the Bank of England to recover control, saying it was depriving the BCV of funds needed to finance Venezuela’s coronavirus response. The Bank of England then asked the court to determine who Britain recognized as Venezuela’s president.","World

Russia's Yandex in talks to buy online bank Tinkoff for $5.5 billion," MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian bank TCS Group Holding is in talks to sell its online bank Tinkoff to Russian internet group Yandex for $5.48 billion (£4.30 billion), the two companies said on Tuesday. The idea was first publicly floated last year when Oleg Tinkov, founder of Russia's TCS group, suggested here to Yandex's chief executive that they combine his bank with Yandex, known as Russia's answer to Google. “The parties have come to an agreement in principle on a transaction that would consist of cash and share consideration worth approximately $5.48 billion or $27.64 per Tinkoff share,” Yandex said. The price represents an 8% premium to Tinkoff’s GDR price as of Sept. 21. One half of the deal is expected to be paid in cash and another half with Yandex shares, a banking source and a source familiar with the matter, told Reuters. Tinkoff is the world’s largest bank that is fully online, with more than 10 million customers across Russia. Its founder, Tinkov has been battling acute leukaemia and had a bone marrow transplant in July. He stepped down as board chairman of the bank to focus on his health and transferred his TCS shares to a Tinkov family trust in the spring. Tinkov, who is in London to see his doctor, told Reuters by phone that he would stay with the company after its merger with Yandex. However, he also said he had already achieved all he wanted on the financial market and it was time to do something else, such as create a charity foundation to combat leukaemia. The possible deal was announced a few months after Yandex said it was terminating its partnership with Sberbank, which opened the door for Yandex to compete with the country’s largest bank. The deal will give Yandex potential synergies in data and products, but also exposes it to banking risks, which means it is crucial to retain the TCS management team, Maria Sukhanova, an analyst at BCS brokerage, said. Sukhanova said Yandex would have to take on more debt or issue new shares to pay for the deal.","World

Argentina economy plunges record 19.1% in second quarter on pandemic impact," BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s economy contracted a record 19.1% in the second quarter versus the same period a year earlier as the coronavirus pandemic crippled production and demand, though was slightly better than analyst forecasts. The steep fall, deeper than a 16.3% drop during Argentina’s major 2002 crisis, came as the South American country imposed a strict lockdown in mid-March to stem the virus. The country has over 640,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and nearly 13,500 deaths. Argentina, a major grains producer, has been in recession since 2018 and is just emerging from default on its sovereign debt, with investors again growing concerned about prospects for its economic recovery and dwindling foreign currency reserves. The government imposed the lockdown on March 20, and while it has been eased it remains in place until at least Oct. 11, with Argentina still at its peak in terms of daily case numbers. The country recorded over 400 deaths in 24 hours on Monday. “The key is the lockdown, which restricted supply and was a blow to demand, which pummelled economic activity in the second quarter of 2020,” said consultancy Ecolatina. A Reuters poll of 14 local and foreign analysts ahead of the data had forecast a 19.9% average contraction for the April-June period and a median estimate of a 19.6% drop. The Q2 fall was deeper than neighbour Brazil, though better than hard-hit Peru. “The strong isolation restrictions imposed from the second half of March and that lasted until August had a significant economic cost for the entire country,” said economist Natalia Motyl of consultancy Libertad y Progreso. Motyl added that services, construction and manufacturing had been the hardest hit, while the important farm export sector had been less affected by the lockdown, that had taken a hit from global commodities prices. Argentina’s economy, which declined a revised 5.2% in the first quarter of the year, is estimated to contract around 12% this year, according to a central bank poll and government forecasts.","World

"Exclusive: U.S. regulator to relax proposed whistleblower caps, tighter tip deadlines - sources"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is poised to walk back a proposal to impose discretionary caps on whistleblower awards and tighten deadlines for formally filing tips when it votes to overhaul the bounty program this week, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday will finalize changes to its whistleblower program, but will water down these proposed measures after whistleblower advocates, lawyers and lawmakers said the changes could deter insiders from flagging corporate fraud and misconduct. In 2018, the SEC proposed here reworking the program which allows the SEC to reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with between 10% and 30% of the fine. Created in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis, the program has resulted in more than $2 billion in penalties and $523 million in tipster rewards. The program attracts thousands of tips annually, public data shows, overwhelming SEC staff who can take years to assess all the claims and issue awards. SEC chair Jay Clayton has said he views the program as vital, but wants to make it more efficient and speed up awards. The SEC proposed, among other measures, giving staff more latitude when assessing the value of awards and the discretion to reduce some payouts if they exceeded $30 million. It also proposed requiring that whistleblowers formally file their tip within 30 days of first making contact with the agency. Currently, whistleblowers may file their tip, a long legal document required to claim a bounty, long after they first make contact with SEC staff and a probe is underway. Whistleblower advocates and lawyers said the changes would reduce incentives for tipsters to flag the most egregious frauds by increasing the legal costs of filing tips, limiting rewards and creating uncertainty. Whistleblowers face big risks and need confidence they will be adequately compensated, advocates say. Some of the planned changes had also met with resistance on Capitol Hill, including from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a longtime champion of federal whistleblower protections, the sources said. Democratic lawmakers on Thursday also wrote to Clayton, warning against reducing rewards or injecting “uncertainty and ambiguity” into the program. The SEC on Wednesday is set to water down those two proposals, the five people said. One of them added it will replace the proposed discretionary cap with a “more generous” solution, without elaborating. The same person said it will also address the filing deadline issue so that “in no case would a whistleblower not be eligible for an award because they contacted the SEC informally.” While the concessions are a win for whistleblowers, some lawyers raised new concerns in recent days that another provision would limit rewards the agency can issue for related enforcement actions brought by fellow agencies. Stephen Kohn, a partner at Kohn, Kohn and Colapinto, warned in a public letter filed with the SEC on Monday that the change could discourage cooperation between multiple enforcement agencies. Reuters could not ascertain if the SEC planned to address that concern. Corporate lobbyists have been pushing the SEC to revise the program for years. They say excessive awards have spawned a cottage industry of tipsters and their attorneys who get a cut of the reward, overwhelming SEC staff with unhelpful and sometimes bogus tips. The SEC received 5,200 tips in 2019, the second highest number since the program kicked off in 2011. The majority of awards have been less than $2 million but some have been as high as $50 million. The SEC has said the proposed changes would ensure rewards are “reasonably necessary” and has pointed out that additional discretion would also allow staff to adjust bounties upwards in cases of smaller penalties.

The new fundraising is an extension of the Series G round which was announced last month, when D1 Capital Partners invested $200 million in the company, and will give Robinhood an $11.7 billion valuation, the spokeswoman said. The new cash is coming from new and existing investors in Robinhood, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, DST Global, Ribbit Capital, 9Yards Capital, and D1 Capital Partners. “We’ve raised an additional $460 million in subsequent closings to our Series G to support our core product and customer experience and new offerings like cash management and recurring investments,” the spokeswoman added. The fundraising underscores investor appetite to back Robinhood as the company benefits from increased trading activity by retail traders during the COVID-19 lockdown. Robinhood’s latest fundraise will take the amount of capital it has raised from investors in 2020 to around $1.25 billion, and the total amount of capital secured to more than $2 billion, according to Reuters calculations based upon PitchBook data.","World

Dollar holds gains as virus woes hurt euro and sterling," TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held onto gains against major currencies on Wednesday, supported by positive U.S. economic data and concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and Britain. The New Zealand dollar is in focus before a meeting later on Wednesday where the country’s central bank is expected to leave its official cash rate at record lows and update its assessment of the economic outlook. The greenback is likely to continue to grind higher in the short term as the coronavirus rattles sentiment in Europe, but uncertainty about this year’s U.S. presidential election means the dollar could be prone to more volatile swings. “Some people are betting for more dollar strength against the euro, which looks overvalued,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “The picture in Europe has completely changed, because the economic recovery is stalling and there is a second wave of the virus, but I’m also worried about U.S. politics.” The dollar was quoted at $1.1708 per euro EUR=D3 on Wednesday in Asia, close to a two-month low hit in the previous trading session. The pound GBP=D3 bought $1.2744, near the lowest since late July, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled new restrictions on business activity to tackle a second wave of the coronavirus. The dollar was quoted at 0.9198 Swiss franc CHF=EBS, holding onto a 0.6% gain from Tuesday. The U.S. currency was little changed at 105.06 yen JPY=D3. On Tuesday the greenback was bolstered by data showing U.S. home sales surged to their highest level in nearly 14 years in August, but comments from a prominent Federal Reserve official sent mixed signals. The U.S. economy risks a longer, slower recovery and “recessionary dynamics” if Congress fails to pass an additional fiscal stimulus package, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said on Tuesday. It is possible for the Fed to raise interest rates before inflation starts to average 2%, Evans also said. The dollar index =USD, which pits the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.4% on Tuesday to 93.975. Sentiment for the euro has slowly weakened as investors grow increasingly worried about surging coronavirus infections in countries like France and Spain, raising the risk of lockdowns. Many euro zone countries have reintroduced travel restrictions, forcing airlines to scale back passenger services after a relatively quick run up over the summer. Traders in the pound and the euro are also worried that Britain and the European Union will fail to agree a free trade deal, which would cause additional economic strain. The New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 was quoted at $0.6631 ahead of policy decision by the country's central bank on Wednesday. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to hold off on further stimulus but traders want to see how the central bank assesses the impact of the coronavirus. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 held steady at $0.7172, but the tone was slightly weak after a senior central banker on Tuesday flagged the prospect of currency market intervention and negative interest rates.","World

"Nike smashes revenue, profit estimates on North America online boom"," (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N easily beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Tuesday, powered by online sales for its Air Maxes and other shoes in North America, sending its shares up about 9%. Nike’s brick-and-mortar sales have fallen off since the COVID-19 pandemic began, as malls and department stores around the world shuttered. To combat this, the footwear maker has turned its focus on direct-to-consumer sales, especially through its own website and apps. The brand’s digital sales surged 82% in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, with at least double-digit rises recorded in all regions. In the prior quarter, Nike reported a 75% increase in online sales, which are now nearly a third of total revenue – a goal Nike had previously set a for 2023. Shares in the Portland, Oregon-based company have risen 16% this year and are set to open on Wednesday at an all-time high of about $127. Nike has gained favor among shoppers this year with investments in marketing itself as a socially conscious company, prominently supporting movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote. Earnings before interest and taxes rose 18% in North America, Nike’s biggest market, with footwear sales up 11% to nearly $3 billion. Tuesday’s results are a far-cry from those of just a quarter ago, when Nike reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets like North America, Europe and China. Margins First-quarter sales in China, where the economy opened from lockdowns much earlier than in other parts of the world, rose 6% led by factory stores and online sales. Despite the pandemic and slow footfall, Nike said it kept nearly all its store doors open - more than in the last quarter - across North America, Europe, Africa, China and the Middle East. However, some analysts say U.S. retailers including Foot Locker and Dick’s Sporting Goods - which canceled shipments in the early days of the pandemic - have begun making orders for inventory in the second half of Nike’s fiscal year. The company’s net income rose to $1.52 billion, or 95 cents per share, from $1.37 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.6% to $10.6 billion. Analysts had forecast a profit of 47 cents per share and revenue of $9.15 billion, according to Refinitv IBES.","World

"Barclays, SocGen UK staff revert to home working as government advice shifts"," LONDON (Reuters) - Up to 1,000 Barclays BARC.L staff who had returned to office-based working in recent weeks will revert to working from home following British government guidance on Tuesday, a spokesman for the bank told Reuters. French lender Societe Generale SOGN.PA said it is also ""adapting its position in line with UK government guidance"", without stating the number of workers recently returned to work in its London offices who will now stay home. Two other big British lenders told Reuters they will also likely reverse recent return-to-work moves for non-essential staff. Lloyd’s of London also asked its employees in the UK on Tuesday to work from home following guidance from the government. “Lloyd’s Underwriting Room is certified as a COVID-secure environment and will remain open for market participants,” the company’s spokesperson said in a statement. Goldman Sachs GS.N said in an internal memo on Tuesday its UK headquarters will remain open to staff who need to remain in the office. “You are reminded that the wearing of masks is required at all times in the office, except at your desk,” chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs International Richard Gnodde wrote in the memo. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to work from home where possible and ordered bars and restaurants to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19. The latest advice comes just weeks after Johnson urged people to return to their workplaces to try to limit the economic damage to nearly-abandoned city centres. Around 22,000 Barclays staff have remained working in its offices worldwide throughout the pandemic, as designated key workers needed to keep the financial system ticking over. Of the roughly 1,000 more who had begun to return to work worldwide, hundreds based in Britain will resume working from home, the spokesman said, with others potentially following suit if local advice changes in other countries. Banks, including Barclays, had begun to return more staff to office-based working, mainly in Britain where the government had earlier encouraged people to resume their daily commutes. More lenders are also expected to tell all but essential staff to work from home, a source at another big British bank said on Tuesday, asking not to be named. Some banks, including NatWest Group NWG.L, have told staff they can work from home until next year.","World

Dollar rises on hawkish comments; stocks end up," NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar continued to rise on Tuesday after hawkish remarks from a Federal Reserve speaker, while stocks ended higher with a boost from Amazon even as curbs to control the spread of COVID-19 raised the fear of a second wave of lockdowns. Crude rose after a hard fall on Monday, while stocks in Europe and Wall Street more than offset the losses elsewhere. The dollar index =USD was having its strongest two-day run since April. Sterling took a hit after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons to go back to working from home, along with new curbs on pubs, bars and restaurants that he said could be in place for as long as six months without some form of vaccine. “As we all know, the virus doesn’t live in a vacuum and what you see in one country or region will affect other places. Economically it could have an effect,” said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. The dollar also got a lift after Chicago Fed President Charles Evans mentioned the prospect of raising interest rates. “All we’ve been hearing from the Fed for the last few months is we’re not going to hike rates at any point in the foreseeable future. Then Evans came in and challenged that narrative, so the market got caught off-guard,” said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The dollar index =USD rose 0.403%, with the euro EUR= down 0.5% to $1.171. The Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.29% versus the greenback at 104.97 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2738, down 0.59% on the day. The 5.7% lift from Amazon AMZN.O was large enough to boost stocks on Wall Street even as the United States reached 200,000 COVID-19-related deaths and as the passage of more stimulus to help the coronavirus-battered economy became more unlikely. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 140.48 points, or 0.52%, to 27,288.18, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 34.51 points, or 1.05%, to 3,315.57 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 184.84 points, or 1.71%, to 10,963.64.

"Fed, Treasury chiefs back more aid for small business but leave details fuzzy"," (Reuters) - Top U.S. economic policymakers opened the door on Tuesday to further aid for small businesses hit by the coronavirus-triggered recession, but differed over how broad it might extend and the manner in which it should be delivered. In testimony before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were pressed by lawmakers concerned the multi-trillion-dollar effort to battle the economic fallout from the pandemic had left a broad swathe of businesses vulnerable, from the smallest corner restaurants to commercial office properties and hotels. Mnuchin and Powell said they were looking for ways to extend more help, but also that they were hitting legal and practical limits that might require action by Congress to avoid. Fed loans backed by commercial buildings as collateral, for example, were often prohibited by existing lending agreements that forbid the owners from further borrowing, Powell said. And proposals that the U.S. central bank loosen requirements for its Main Street Lending Program to make it more accessible to smaller firms, he said, overlooked the fact that larger businesses have been the ones interested in central bank credit. “There is very little demand below a million dollars,” Powell said in response to Mnuchin’s suggestion that the minimum loan size under the facility could be lowered from $250,000 to $100,000. Help for small businesses, Powell said, would better come through another grant-type program like the Paycheck Protection Program because “trying to underwrite the credit of hundreds of thousands of small businesses would be very difficult,” for the Fed. Tuesday’s hearing, which came six months into the pandemic and six weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, highlighted the crossroads the economy seems to be facing. After a historic crash during March and April, when many stores were shut down, the rebound has been surprisingly strong. About half of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered, and Powell said there had been “marked improvement” in many other economic measures. But the coronavirus is still rampant, and there is a broad sense among economists, including at the Fed, that the recovery will lapse if further government support is not provided, in particular to families and small businesses. Powell on Tuesday noted that much of the recent healthy economic data resulted from spending under the $2.3 trillion CARES Act. Approved in March as the foundation of the government’s economic response to the pandemic, it authorized the Treasury to fund an array of Fed lending and credit programs, including the Main Street facility, as well as make direct payments to individuals, provide enhanced unemployment benefits, and give small business PPP loans that are intended to be forgiven. The result was not only a jobs rebound, but a steadying of personal incomes and jump in personal savings accounts that Powell said had made the economy “resilient” to the run of loan defaults, evictions and other problems feared when the recession hit. Since many of those programs have lapsed, “the risk is that (people) go through those savings, and they haven’t been able to find employment ... Their spending will decline, their ability to stay in their homes will decline. The economy will begin to feel those negative effects,” Powell said. The fate of small businesses, the main driver of U.S. employment but also one that is vulnerable to cash flow disruptions and short of credit, is key to shaping how fast and broad the recovery will be. Powell, Mnuchin and lawmakers agreed further help for the sector is needed. Yet there was no quick path offered. The Fed has been stung by criticism its much-vaunted “Main Street” program has done little actual lending. Of $600 billion in potential loans, about $2 billion has been processed since the program opened in June. But Powell said the solution was not to lower the minimum loan size or open the program to a class of borrower the Fed would find it difficult to judge creditworthy. Rather he said something like the PPP, a program that in effect acts as a taxpayer-funded small business grant, “is a better way to approach that space.” Mnuchin said the Trump administration agrees and would be open to repurpose some funds already allocated by Congress. But Mnuchin added he also felt follow-up programs should be targeted more narrowly to rebuild jobs or focus on businesses, including restaurants, that have been damaged more deeply by the pandemic. Congress, for its part, is at a stalemate over providing further coronavirus-related aid, with dwindling expectations for action on any bill before the November election. The improvement Powell noted in the economy comes with important footnotes. Despite the rebound in employment, the economy remains around 11 million jobs below where it was in February. Full recovery, Powell said, will also hinge on whether the virus is controlled and “is likely to come only when people are confident it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.” Until then, he repeated, further fiscal help will likely be needed to avoid the worst. Tuesday’s hearing was the first of three featuring Powell this week. On Wednesday, he is due to appear before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. On Thursday, Powell and Mnuchin will testify before the Senate Banking Committee.","World

UK PM Johnson wins over rebels on Brexit treaty-busting powers," LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday moved a step closer to getting parliamentary approval for new powers to break the Withdrawal Agreement struck with the European Union last year as lawmakers backed changes to the Internal Market Bill . The bill aims to ensure Britain’s four nations can trade freely with each other after Brexit. Ministers say that will require breaking the EU exit treaty to protect Northern Ireland unless stalled talks with Brussels make a breakthrough. The plan has angered the EU and drawn heavy criticism from lawmakers who say that going back on an international agreement damages Britain’s reputation. Nevertheless, a government concession giving parliament a say over whether to use the treaty-breaking powers snuffed out a rebellion and was approved without a vote. Former finance minister Sajid Javid was one of several potential rebels to accept the government’s compromise, having initially said he could not support the bill. Although some in Johnson’s Conservative Party, like former prime minister Theresa May, have not been won over, the bill now passes to the final stages of approval in parliament’s lower chamber, which will take place next week. After that, the bill faces two months of scrutiny in the upper chamber, where Johnson does not have a majority. Many in the upper chamber have expressed grave concern about the bill and could try to strip the contentious powers out of it. However, any changes would have to be approved by both chambers, potentially setting up a stand-off between the two.","World

Airbus CEO: we can't guarantee no compulsory layoffs," PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus will do its best to cut costs without resorting to compulsory redundancies, but it cannot guarantee they won’t happen, CEO Guillaume Faury told French radio station RTL on Tuesday. With air travel at a fraction of its normal level due to restrictions and travellers’ fears related to the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines have slowed deliveries of new aircraft. Airbus has said it needs to shed 15,000 posts worldwide. “The crisis is existential. Our life as a business is potentially at risk if we don’t take the right measures. We are taking them,” Faury said. “The situation is so serious, and we are faced with so much uncertainty, that I think no one can guarantee there won’t be compulsory redundancies if we’re to adapt to the situation, especially if it evolves further.” “On the other hand, what I say clearly is that we have a lot of work to do, we will do everything we can to avoid arriving at that point,” he told the radio station. “There are lots of measures we can take between voluntary redundancies and compulsory redundancies.” In a letter sent to staff this month, Faury warned them the planemaker may have to carry out compulsory layoffs after air travel failed to recover from the pandemic as quickly as anticipated.","World

French presidential palace requested LVMH letter - sources," PARIS (Reuters) - France’s presidential palace asked the country’s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to write to LVMH advising the luxury goods company to defer its purchase of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, two sources familiar with the letter’s origins told Reuters. The French company’s $16 billion purchase of Tiffany hit the rocks this month after LVMH said it could not complete the deal by a Nov. 24 deadline, triggering a legal battle. LVMH cited, in part, an official foreign ministry request to delay closing the deal to January amid trade tensions with the United States. The letter requesting the delay was signed by Le Drian, U.S. legal filings by Tiffany and LVMH show. The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron’s office, had asked Le Drian to produce the letter. The Elysee declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the foreign ministry referred enquiries to a representative for Le Drian, who did not immediately respond. Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday, that, in the context of an ongoing trade row with the United States, his ministry had received an enquiry from LVMH, and that it was natural for him to respond with advice. There was no immediate comment from LVMH on Le Drian’s remarks Asked by Reuters about any interactions between the Elysee and the foreign ministry over the letter, an LVMH spokesman repeated statements denying it had solicited the letter. Tiffany declined to comment on any Elysee involvement. The coronavirus crisis has dealt a huge blow to the luxury goods sector and raised questions about whether LVMH was overpaying with its $135 a share offer. LVMH said after the deal fell apart that Tiffany had significantly underperformed LVMH’s own comparable brands in the first half of 2020, and that the U.S. group’s prospects for 2020 were “very disappointing”. In a lawsuit filed in Delaware to force the deal through, Tiffany said updated forecasts it had provided to LVMH in August 2020 projected that its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 would be greater than the previous year, demonstrating a rapid return to, and surpassing of, its pre-pandemic performance. Sources told Reuters in June that LVMH’s billionaire owner Bernard Arnault, a dealmaker known as the “wolf in cashmere” who has built an empire through acquisitions, was exploring ways to renegotiate the price, something LVMH has denied. Analysts have said the two sides may still agree to close the deal at a lower price, although some did not rule out that Arnault may have already set his sights elsewhere. One point of contention has been the provenance of the Aug. 31. letter from the foreign ministry. Lawyers for LVMH sent an English translation of it to Tiffany’s lawyers, a legal filing submitted by the U.S. firm shows. “In order to support the steps taken vis-a-vis the American government, you should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until January 6, 2021,” the filing quoted the letter as saying. “I am sure that you will understand the need to take part in our country’s efforts to defend its national interests.” Responding to media reports that LVMH had solicited the letter, the French company has said repeatedly that it had no involvement, and that any reports it was involved are malicious. Two government sources familiar with the details told Reuters that LVMH approached the French finance ministry seeking help in deferring completion of the deal. The two government sources were not the same sources who said the Elysee asked the foreign minister to provide the letter. One of the two government sources said the approach by LVMH to the finance ministry happened in mid-July. The second source did not say when it had happened. Both of the government sources said the finance ministry rejected the request from LVMH. The finance ministry declined to comment. Asked on Tuesday if LVMH had any involvement in the origins of the letter, the company spokesman said: “We formally deny these unfounded rumours”.","World

Exclusive: Deutsche Bank to close 20% of German branches in coronavirus shift," FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank plans to shutter one in five branches in Germany as it seeks to save costs and capitalise on the changing habits of customers during the coronavirus pandemic, an executive said. Philipp Gossow, who oversees the retail banking business in Germany, told Reuters that the reduction to some 400 branches from around 500 currently would occur primarily in urban locations and take place “as quickly as possible”. The cull comes as Deutsche Bank undergoes a broad overhaul of its global operations that began in 2019 after years of losses. German banks traditionally operate large numbers of branches compared with those in the Netherlands or Britain, where customers are more comfortable with digital banking. Banks throughout Europe are rethinking their branch strategies in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Deutsche’s rival Commerzbank recently opted to shut 200 of its 1,000 branches and is considering closing hundreds more. “Coronavirus has further changed the demands placed on advisory services and the branch business,” Gossow said. “Even customers who were previously not very familiar with online banking are now doing many simple banking transactions from home on their computer or iPad,” he said. Gossow said more complex advisory services were taking place increasingly by phone or video chat and the bank would invest an undisclosed amount to build out those services. He elaborated on the changes on Tuesday at a conference in Frankfurt and in a memo to staff, in which he acknowledged the changes would mean hardship for some. But the move is not expected to meet strong resistance from employees. The Verdi labour union said in a statement it was “generally right” for Deutsche to review its branch network.","World

Coronavirus accelerates Nigeria's digital banking push," LAGOS/ABUJA (Reuters) - Civil servant Amos Dam is frustrated after waiting two hours to enter a bank in Nigeria’s capital Abuja. He is one of about 20 people sitting on plastic chairs under a canopy to protect them from the sun on a pavement between a busy road and the bank. “It has become much more tedious trying to carry out any transactions in the bank,” said Dam, referring to the impact of social distancing measures reducing numbers inside branches to halt the spread of the new coronavirus. The pandemic has increased the use of digital banking services in Nigeria where restrictions on the amount of dollars that can be withdrawn have also contributed to long waiting times since some people require multiple trips to get foreign currency. A new breed of digital banks, without physical branches, say they have had a boost due to the pandemic. Kuda Bank, a digital only bank launched in August 2019 with 500 customers, said it tripled its daily adoption of customers in a trend that began during lockdown in Nigeria’s main cities - Lagos and Abuja - from late March until early May. The bank’s chief executive officer Babs Ogundeyi said it had taken on around 3,000 customers a day from April, compared with just under 1,000 a day before. “We expect the growth to remain,” said Ogundeyi, adding the pandemic forced many to overcome concerns about the safety of online transactions in a culture where a fear of financial internet scams has made people wary of abandoning cash. Uzoma Dozie, CEO of Sparkle, a digital bank launched in June 2019, said the digital only business model was more cost-effective. “Seeing the impact of COVID and the fact that we might see a second wave or other pandemics tells us that we need to build resilience into our businesses, and that means being digital,” he said. He said, however, the lenders collaborated with “bricks and mortar” banks for the use of cash machines. Nigeria’s traditional banks have also seen an increase in digital transactions. Local bank Fidelity said 87% of transactions in the second quarter of this year were made on its digital platforms, compared with 82% in the whole of 2019. Guaranty Trust Bank said the number of people making payments using codes sent via text message rose between December and June from 6.1 million to 6.7 million. Peter Mushangwe, a banking analyst at ratings agency Moody’s, said Nigerian banks were “pursuing digitalization quite vigorously” in a bid to attract more deposits to increase the proportion of their income from fees as income from interest makes up around 70% of their total income. Outside the bank in Abuja, breathing in traffic fumes, Dam said he was there because an electronic cash dispenser failed to provide cash but his account had been debited. He said he preferred using banking apps but that wasn’t stress-free due to poor internet connectivity. “When the bank network is bad ... one transaction could take you the whole day,” he said.","World

Airline industry will never be the same again - former IAG CEO Walsh," LONDON (Reuters) - The airline industry is never going to get back to the way it was before coronavirus, warned the former chief executive of British Airways-owner IAG, adding it will be smaller but more efficient in the future. “It’s never going to get back to the way it was,” Willie Walsh, who retired as IAG CEO earlier this month, said in an online interview with Eurocontrol. Looking five years ahead, Walsh forecast it would be a smaller industry and there would be fewer players. Most of the consolidation would initially come through failures, he said, as he also predicted COVID-19 would make airlines more resilient. “Most airlines are restructuring in a very positive way: they’re going to be more efficient and the cost base will be more variable, they’ll be able to respond to crises going forward,” he said. Looking at the next few months though, he said it would be “very, very tough”. Flight data shows that a hoped-for recovery in air travel in Europe has gone into reverse. Eurocontrol, Europe’s organisation for the safety of air navigation, said that European airlines such as British Airways and Ryanair had shown traffic declines of 4% over the last two weeks. But striking a positive note, Walsh said that airlines should take comfort from the fact that there was still demand for travel. “People are comfortable getting on-board. What they’re uncomfortable about is the uncertainty as to whether they’re going to have to quarantine when they get to their destination or when they return from their destination. That’s really what’s undermining customer confidence,” he said. After 41 years in the airline industry, former pilot Walsh 58, was CEO of IAG from 2011 when it was founded. He handed the reins to Spanish insider Luis Gallego on Sept. 8. “I’ve surprised myself at how easy it has been to adapt to retirement,” Walsh said when asked about the last few weeks.","World

Airlines call for COVID-19 tests before all international flights," PARIS (Reuters) - Global airlines called on Tuesday for airport COVID-19 tests for all departing international passengers to replace the quarantines they blame for exacerbating the travel slump. Rapid and affordable antigen tests that can be administered by non-medical staff are expected to become available in “coming weeks” and should be rolled out under globally agreed standards, the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said during an online media briefing. “We don’t see any alternative solution that would be less challenging or more effective,” IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said. Airlines hammered by the pandemic are pressing governments to embrace alternatives to blanket travel restrictions that are still hampering a traffic recovery - and now tightening again in Europe amid resurgent case numbers. With rapid antigen tests becoming available for as little as $7 each, De Juniac said, airlines will push for their use to be endorsed by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the U.N. agency that oversees global aviation rules. IATA believes production could be quickly increased to millions per day and the tests phased in between late October and the end of the year, “helping to save a part of the winter season”, De Juniac told Reuters television. A global agreement is needed to ensure pre-departure test results are uniformly accepted by the destination country, he said. “It will also boost passenger confidence that everybody on the aircraft has been tested.” The airlines’ position has evolved with the test technology. IATA argued a month ago for new rules to recognise lab-based PCR tests conducted 48 hours before departure. Last-minute airport screening is more effective because it “seals off the system” against forged certificates or infections contracted just before travel, De Juniac said on Tuesday. Antigen tests are faster but less sensitive and therefore slightly more likely to miss positive cases than the PCR alternatives, although the accuracy gap has narrowed. Among companies marketing the new tests, German diagnostics specialist Qiagen said earlier this month it planned to launch a COVID-19 antigen test that provided results in 15 minutes and could be deployed in airports or stadiums.","Tech

'Wet ashtray' wine grapes left to birds as fires choke West Coast vineyards," (Reuters) - Heavy ground smoke clouded Hanson Vineyards in Oregon’s picturesque Willamette Valley for more than a week following a Labor Day windstorm that kicked up wildfires across the western United States. Jason Hanson expects his crews may only harvest five tons of grapes, including his Chardonnay and Gamay varieties, down from the 25 to 30 tons his fields yielded last year. The birds can have the rest, he said, as the fruit has likely absorbed too much smoke to be salvaged and would produce wine that tastes like a “wet ashtray.” “With the dense smoke that we’ve had at the ground level for so long now, almost everything has to be affected or damaged,” Hanson said. “I have a yearly fight with the birds. This year I’ll just let them win.” The historic wildfires across the western United States, home to the bulk of the country’s vineyards and major producers of crops from apples to zucchini, have ravaged farmers and ranchers already hard hit by the Trump administration’s trade wars and demand disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. Atmospheric smoke has obscured grape-ripening sunlight while ash has coated green beans, cauliflower and other produce in nearby fields just days before scheduled harvesting. Poor air quality is slowing harvesting as farms limit fieldwork hours and some run low on particle-filtering masks due to the coronavirus pandemic. For wineries, the wildfires have only deepened recent wounds. A drop in restaurant traffic and smaller crowds visiting vineyards for tastings had already been sapping key sources of revenue. Many tasting rooms remain shuttered due to fire and smoke risks, while grapes awaiting harvest in storied wine regions like Willamette Valley or California’s Napa and Sonoma Valleys may be damaged or ruined entirely. Oregon, Washington state and California together produce about 90% of all U.S. wine. The true impact on the $70 billion industry will not be known for months as the typical wildfire season is only just beginning, and crop damage can vary greatly from field to field. “You have a far greater potential for tainted wine the closer you are to the fire,” said Eric Jensen, owner of Booker and My Favorite Neighbor wineries in California’s Paso Robles region. “We’re testing constantly and we believe in Paso we’ll be blessed because of the distance that the smoke traveled to get to us. But in Napa and Sonoma, the proximity is causing issues.” Smoke has blanketed much of the U.S. West as fires have charred nearly 5 million acres (2 million hectares), but some wine areas such as Napa, Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Monterey have been much closer to blazes than areas like Santa Barbara and Paso Robles. Laboratories that test grapes for smoke contamination are overwhelmed this year, with some taking up to a month to return results, instead of less than a week normally. Vineyards use that data to gauge whether to harvest or not. Winemakers and scientists are still learning how smoke can affect wine grapes and how the effects can be mitigated. Australia has been at the forefront of research, as drought-fueled bushfires have riled its industry for years. But studies at American universities have ramped up over the past five years, helped by U.S. Department of Agriculture funding, as climate change is expected to increasingly impact U.S. wineries. It is too soon to judge how the wildfires will impact 2020 vintages, but harvested grape supplies will likely be smaller, said Glenn Proctor, partner and broker at California-based Ciatti Global Wine & Grape Brokers. Winemakers short of newly harvested grapes are expected to buy bulk wine from the 2019 season for blending with what is available from this year, he said. Fear of reputational risk will prevent winemakers from bottling and selling any wine with an unpleasant smoke taste, he said. Ample supplies coming into this season should offset any shortfall from this year’s harvest so work-from-home Zoom Happy Hours will likely not notice any impact, he said. “I still think we’re going to see some good wines coming out of 2020 because the growing conditions were great through the season,” Proctor said. “The fires have put a question mark on everything but I’m still hopeful that most of those wines will play out.”","Tech

U.S. existing home sales approach 14-year high; prices scale record peak," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales surged to their highest level in nearly 14 years in August as the housing market continued to outperform the overall economy, but record high home prices could squeeze first-time buyers out of the market. The report from the National Association of Realtors confirmed home sales had recovered after slumping when the economy almost ground to a halt as businesses were shuttered in mid-March in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Demand for housing is being fueled by record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel on Tuesday that the economy has shown “marked improvement” since plunging into recession in February, though the path ahead remains uncertain. “The housing market has continued its remarkable recovery amidst an otherwise fraught economy that has been battered by the pandemic,” said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. “However, we should continue to be paranoid about the sustainability of sales. With lack of housing supply, there is an upward pressure on home prices which threatens to detract the benefits accrued from low mortgage rates.” Existing home sales increased 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million units last month, the highest level since December 2006. August’s increase in homes sales, which marked three straight months of gains, was in line with economists’ expectations. The median existing house price jumped 11.4% from a year ago to a record $310,600 in August. Sales last month were concentrated in the $250,000 to $1 million and over price range, with transactions below the $250,000 price band down sharply. Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, jumped 10.5% on a year-on-year basis in August. The PHLX housing index increased more than 1.5%, outpacing a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were down. Though the coronavirus crisis has left nearly 30 million people on unemployment benefits, joblessness has disproportionately affected low-wage workers in the services sector, who are typically young and renters. Home sales rose in all four regions last month. Demand for housing was skewed toward single-family homes as people sought larger spaces for home offices and schooling. The NAR reckons the migration to suburbs from city centers could become permanent even if a vaccine is developed for the respiratory illness. Single-family home sales advanced 1.7% in August. While multi-family home sales increased 8.6%, they accounted for 10.5% of sales, down from the 12% that is considered the norm for the housing market. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.87%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. A persistent shortage of homes for sale and August’s double-digit house price inflation growth are red flags. The shortage is concentrated in the single-family housing segment. Though single-family builders’ confidence hit a record high this month and permits for single-family home construction jumped in August to their highest level since May 2007, the supply squeeze is unlikely to ease as fires in the West have boosted lumber prices. There were 1.49 million previously owned homes on the market in August, down 18.6% from a year ago. At August’s sales pace, it would take 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.1 months in July and 4.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. “The 11% gain in prices is far above income growth and threatens overall affordability especially for first-time buyers,” said Joel Kan an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. “It’s clear that more inventory is needed to keep home prices from rising too quickly.” Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 22 days, matching July, but down from 31 days in August 2019. Sixty-nine percent of homes sold in August were on the market for less than a month. According to the NAR, realtors were reporting multiple bids for houses on the market. First-time buyers accounted for 33% of sales in August, down from 34% in July 2020, but up from 31% in August 2019. Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, bought 14% of homes in August. All-cash sales accounted for 18% of transactions.","Tech

Ralph Lauren to lay off thousands as pandemic dulls luxury fashion," (Reuters) - Ralph Lauren Corp said on Tuesday it would cut 15% of its global workforce by the end of this fiscal year as the luxury retailer strives to lower costs and ride out the impact of COVID-19 on sales and shopping habits. The New York-based fashion house, which has 530 stores globally, said the changes would see it move more business online. The company did not say how many or what type of jobs could go, but based on its last reported total workforce of about 24,900 employees, the changes could impact more than 3,700 employees. “The changes happening in the world around us have accelerated the shifts we saw pre-COVID, and we are fast-tracking some of our plans to match them,” Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said. The health crisis has hit demand for high-end handbags, apparel and accessories as more customers hold back on non-essential spending, forcing many companies to slow their expansion plans. It has also put the brakes on the industry’s biggest ever merger, with France’s LVMH trying to back out of its $16 billion deal to acquire Tiffany & Co. Britain’s Burberry Group and luxury department store operator Harrods have also cut hundreds of jobs. “After stores reopened, the second phase of recovery for retailers is looking at their balance sheets and how to improve profitability, and for high-end clothing companies, that often means closing stores or letting people go,” said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. However, online sales of luxury goods have surged and Ralph Lauren said it would invest in digital platforms to support e-commerce operations and expand product personalization. The layoffs could result in gross annual pre-tax savings of about $180 million to $200 million, the company said. It expects to incur one-time pre-tax charges of about $120 million to $160 million in fiscal 2021.","Tech

India trials for Russia's 'Sputnik-V' vaccine could start in next few weeks: exec," BENGALURU (Reuters) - Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd could begin late-stage Indian clinical trials of Russia’s potential coronavirus vaccine in the next few weeks, an executive at the Indian drugmaker said on Tuesday. Indian trials of the Sputnik-V vaccine candidate, being developed by Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, will enroll 1,000-2,000 participants and be conducted at multiple government and private hospitals across the country, Deepak Sapra, CEO for API and pharmaceutical services at Dr. Reddy’s, told Reuters. “We want to get to the first step - which is the commencement of the clinical trials by getting the necessary approvals from the Indian regulators - within the next few weeks,” Sapra said. The trials are part of a deal between the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and Dr Reddy’s, in which the Indian firm will conduct Phase III studies in India, pursue local regulatory approvals and, subject to approval, distribute the finished vaccine product in India. RDIF will supply 100 million doses to Dr Reddy’s. The RDIF has also reached agreements with Indian manufacturers to produce 300 million doses of the shot in India. Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine. Sputnik-V doses supplied in India will likely be a combination of Indian- and Russian-made doses, Sapra said, adding that RDIF and Dr Reddy’s would soon identify potential manufacturers in India. The RDIF has said vaccine deliveries to India could begin in late 2020, but Sapra suggested it could take longer. “I think it’s going to be several months before we accomplish all the steps in the process,” he added. India, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, is the world’s second worst affected country by COVID-19 behind the United States. For weeks, it has reported the world’s highest daily jump in infections, which reached a total of 5.6 million on Tuesday.","Tech

India's Serum Institute starts manufacturing Codagenix's potential COVID-19 vaccine," (Reuters) - Codagenix Inc said on Tuesday Serum Institute of India has started manufacturing the U.S. biotech firm’s potential COVID-19 vaccine and it expects to begin early-stage human trial of the vaccine by the end of 2020 in the UK. Serum Institute, the world’s largest vaccine maker by number of doses produced, will develop Codagenix’s CDX-005, which is delivered intranasally rather than via an injection. Serum Institute is working on several vaccine candidates for the novel coronavirus - including potentially mass-producing the one from AstraZeneca-Oxford University that has garnered global headlines - as well as developing its own. More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally, with 38 in human trials, and candidates from Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are already in late-stage trials.","Tech

Shapoorji Pallonji group to separate interests from Tata group," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group, the largest minority shareholder in Tata Group, believes it is necessary to separate interests from the autos to steel conglomerate, it said on Tuesday. One of the country’s largest construction firms, the SP group has an 18% stake in Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, on the back of a decades-long relationship. But the two groups have been embroiled in a legal battle since 2016 when Cyrus Mistry, scion of the family that controls the SP Group, was sacked as chairman of Tata Sons. Mistry was sacked from the top job at the helm of the holding company after he fell out with group patriarch Ratan Tata over corporate governance issues at Tata group companies. On Tuesday, India’s Supreme Court restrained the SP group and Mistry from pledging or transferring shares of Tata Sons owned by them. The Mistry family was looking to pledge the shares to raise funds to “meet the crisis arising from the global pandemic”, the SP Group said in its statement, but had been challenged by the Tata Group. “Today, it is with a heavy heart that the Mistry family believes that a separation of interests would best serve all stakeholder groups,” the statement said. Tata Sons did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.","Tech

India's summer-sown grains output seen at 144.52 million tonnes in 2020/21," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian farmers are expected to harvest a record 144.52 million tonnes of grains from summer-sown crops in the crop year to June 2021, the government said on Tuesday, against 143.38 million tonnes gathered in the previous year. In 2020/21, the output of summer-sown rice is estimated at a record 102.36 million tonnes, up from 101.98 million tonnes in 2019/20, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare said in a statement. Higher rice output will help India, the world’s biggest exporter of the grain, to boost its shipments of the staple. Corn output could rise to 19.88 million tonnes from 19.63 million tonnes in the previous season. Oilseed output is expected at 25.73 million tonnes, up from 22.31 million tonnes. Production of peanuts is expected at a record 9.54 million tonnes against 8.36 million tonnes produced in the previous year. Soybean output is seen at 13.58 million tonnes, up from 11.21 million tonnes in the 2019/20 crop year. Higher oilseeds output will cut India’s dependence on expensive vegetable oil imports. India is the world’s biggest importer of edible oils, the third-biggest import item after crude oil and gold. India, which spends about $10 billion a year on edible oils imports, buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and other oils, such as soyoil and sunflower oil, from Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and Russia. Production of protein-rich pulses, or lentils, is estimated at 9.31 million tonnes, up from 7.72 million tonnes. Cotton output could rise to 37.12 million bales of 170 kg each from 35.49 million. Cane production in the world’s biggest consumer of sugar is estimated at 399.83 million tonnes, up from 355 million tonnes. This year’s plentiful monsoon rains, which deliver about 70% of India’s annual rainfall, have helped farmers plant a record acreage with summer crops such as rice, corn, cotton, soybeans and sugarcane.","Tech

Lok Sabha approves labour reforms amid union protests," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s lower house of parliament on Tuesday approved long-pending, disputed labour reforms in the teeth of a boycott by opposition parties and protests from trade unions. The three new labour codes - making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers and imposing operating restrictions on unions – will replace decades-old laws and simplify labour regulations, Santosh Gangwar, India’s labour and employment minister told lawmakers during a debate on the legislation. “India will be left behind if the labour laws are not amended,” he said, adding the new codes will speed up resolution of industrial disputes and provide a social security net to millions of additional workers. The three bills - the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, the Industrial Relations Code and the Code on Social Security - are part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious moves to liberalise conditions for investment. They are set to become law after approval by the upper house of the parliament later this week, and the president’s consent. The Code on Wages, meant to regulate wage and bonus payments, was approved by parliament last year. Under the Industrial Relations Code, companies employing up to 300 workers will not require government permission to lay off workers or close plants - a major demand from industry over the years. The Code also puts restrictions on the recognition of trade unions - making it mandatory for them to represent at least 10% of workers in a given sector - and prohibit them from striking without prior notice and during conciliation proceedings. Lawmakers from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party said during the debate the new laws would provide social security benefits to workers, including ride-hailing companies like Ola and Uber. Unions said they would begin nationwide protests from Wednesday, accusing Modi’s government of using the novel coronavirus pandemic to push through controversial bills without adequate consultation. “This is the beginning of the end of regular jobs,” said Amarjeet Kaur, General Secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, adding the unions would jointly protest against the implementation of the legislation.","Tech

India aims to cut crop waste burning in Punjab and Haryana by 80%," NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to reduce crop waste burning, a major source of air pollution during the winter months, by 75-80% in Punjab and Haryana states, part of the country’s farm belt that borders the capital New Delhi, two government officials said on Tuesday. Every winter, a thick blanket of smog settles over northern India, as a combination of factors such as the burning of crop residues, industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust brings a sharp spike in pollution. Crop residue burning accounts for about a quarter of air pollution in winter months, various studies show. The federal government and the state governments of Punjab and Haryana have ensured that rice farmers can easily hire machines to dispose of the paddy stalks and straw, said the officials, who did not wish to be identified in line with government policy. In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government earmarked $177.61 million for two years to give farmers the subsidy to buy farm equipment, such as mulching and seed drilling machines, that dispose of crop waste without burning them. For the current 2020-21 fiscal year, the government allocated $746.06 million in farm equipment subsidies. “The subsidy programme is in its third year, and it’s going to result in a substantial reduction of up to 75-80% this year,” said one of the officials. The farm fires could pick up in the next few weeks and hit highs in late October and early November, when farmers harvest the rice crop and prepare the ground for winter planting. So far this year, New Delhi has experienced the longest spell of clean air on record. “Rice harvests will start gathering momentum in the next 30 days, and that’s the time when these claims about substantially bringing down crop fires will be put to the test,” said Vimlendu Jha, an environmental expert who founded the activist group Swechha.","Tech

"NSE, Singapore's SGX finalise derivatives tie-up"," BENGALURU (Reuters) - India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) have finalised a derivatives tie-up and ended arbitration proceedings relating to a 2018 dispute on SGX’s launch of an index derivative, the bourses said on Tuesday. The tie-up aims to bring trading of the SGX's Nifty futures contract, based on the NSE's blue-chip Nifty 50 index, to GIFT City, an international financial centre in western India. The bourses last year here received regulatory approval for the collaboration, which had been under discussion for months. The exchanges said the deal aims to create a larger pool of liquidity for Nifty products, as well as boost activity at the GIFT City. India has been trying to lure foreign investors to the city that offers close to zero tax, dollar contracts, and top-notch infrastructure. “The connect will broaden the international and domestic participant base and further strengthen the capital market ecosystem in GIFT city,” NSE Chief Executive Officer Vikram Limaye said in a statement. NSE and SGX had been locked in a dispute since 2018 after NSE sought to block SGX’s launch of a set of new Indian derivatives products on grounds that the offerings infringed its intellectual property rights.","Sport & Life

"No COVID-19 test, no grape harvest in Spain's Basque Country"," LAGUARDIA, Spain (Reuters) - All wine industry workers in Spain’s Rioja-producing region of Alava must undergo a coronavirus test before they start work to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks putting the grape harvest at risk. Grape pickers, who have dubbed 2020 the “harvest of the masks”, will be given their own equipment, including baskets and scissors, which cannot be exchanged, to avoid infections, said a spokeswoman for the Rioja wine regulatory board. Authorities in the Basque Country have made it compulsory for wine estates to provide a list of workers. The health department then carries out the PCR tests. Seasonal workers living in precarious conditions were hard hit by coronavirus outbreaks this summer in Spain, prompting authorities to impose local lockdowns in fruit-growing areas. Authorities are keen to avoid a repetition as the grape harvesting season gets underway. “Until we get the result of the test, we cannot work,” an employee in the wine industry, Quintino Benigno, told Reuters in a makeshift testing centre in Laguardia, Alava, where people waited in line wearing masks. About 6,000 seasonal workers are employed in the Rioja harvesting campaign in the Basque Country’s Alava and the neighbouring region of La Rioja. In the latter, testing is not mandatory but COVID-19 prevention plans that include testing a number of workers are in place. Although coronavirus cases associated with the agricultural sector have declined since the summer, official data shows they still account for 9.9% of the total. A second wave of the coronavirus has put Spain, with the highest infection rate in Western Europe, in the spotlight. Amid uncertainty due to a sales decrease and fewer tourists expected in the wineries due to the pandemic, the Rioja wine regulatory board has not given estimates of how hard it expects business to be hit. “Wineries have already said they will buy grapes for lower prices and business isn’t going as we expected because of COVID,” said vine grower Cristobal Fulleda.","Sport & Life

"UK banks must do more to fight dirty money, says BoE's Woods"," LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s banks must make the fight against dirty money a “top priority” or risk facing more severe fines, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Tuesday. Global banks, including UK-based HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered, face fresh scrutiny on their efforts to curb money laundering after a cache of leaked documents showed they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades. Woods said it was vital that banks played their part in fighting financial crime as the “FinCEN” leaks were a good reminder of how criminals will use the financial system for their own ends. “If the banks get this wrong, then costs for them are very severe, as you have seen in recent years the big fines here in the UK and in the U.S.,” Woods told Bloomberg TV. “They have been doing a lot but they’ll need to do more, and unfortunately this is one of those things that the job is never done,” Woods said, adding that he did not think new rules were necessary at this point. HSBC has said the information in the reports was historic, while Standard Chartered pointed to investments to improve its control procedures. Barclays said global banks were supportive of initiatives to improve transparency of how money was held around the world and which should make client due diligence “a lot easier”. Global spending on anti-money laundering (AML) software was close to $1.5 billion at end-2019 and is expected to exceed $1.9 billion by end-2023, according to Boston-based financial research and advisory firm Aite Group. “We have seen that growth ourselves,” added Rachel Woolley, global director of financial crime at Fenergo, which provides client data management support to more than 80 banks and financial firms including BBVA, Westpac and BNP Paribas. “With digital operational resilience a key focus for financial institutions, not to mention the potential wave of AML reform in response to the FinCEN leaks, it stands to reason that significant investment will be made in technology as banks attempt to increase efficiencies and address increasing compliance concerns,” Woolley told Reuters. Earlier on Tuesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was studying media reports that Singapore banks had informed U.S. regulators of suspicious transactions, adding that it would take “appropriate action” based on the outcome of its review.","Sport & Life

Gold falls as dollar jumps to six-week high," (Reuters) - Gold fell on Tuesday as the dollar climbed to its highest in over a month, while investors remained doubtful over additional stimulus measures to aid the coronavirus-hit economy ahead of speeches from Federal Reserve officials this week. Spot gold fell 0.4% to $1,904.21 per ounce by 1151 GMT, after a steep sell-off dragged it down to its lowest level since Aug. 12, at $1,882.70 on Monday. U.S. gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,911.60 per ounce. The dollar, also considered as a safe-haven, notched a six-week high against a basket of other major currencies earlier in the session, dimming the appeal of bullion for other currency holders. “Gold could be well below yesterday’s lows depending on how deep the equity sell-off goes. It’s just a function of how panicked investors are,” Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said, adding the increased risk-aversion could support the dollar and weigh on gold. U.S. President Donald Trump’s bid to quickly fill the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg left investors fretting over the chances of more fiscal stimulus before the election. Focus now shifts to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony before lawmakers, addressing questions about the raft of emergency measures the central bank has taken to cushion the blow to the economy from the pandemic. Governments are unlikely to roll out stimulus at a similar scale seen when the coronavirus first emerged, even if cases soar as they have already used much of the ammunition, Bank of China International’s Fu said. On the technical side, spot gold may retest support at $1,886 per ounce, a break below which could cause a fall to $1,855, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Elsewhere, silver fell 2.2% to $24.19 per ounce, platinum gained 0.3% to $883.85 and palladium fell 0.2% to $2,269.81.","Sport & Life

Pakistan launches Phase III trials for Chinese Cansinobio's COVID-19 vaccine," ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has launched Phase III clinical trials for CanSino Biologics’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate, a government minister and an official at the Chinese pharmaceutical company said on Tuesday. Pakistan gave the go-ahead for the country’s first Phase-III clinical trial in August for CanSino’s candidate, Ad5-nCoV, led by the government-run National Institute of Health (NIH) and pharmaceutical company AJM - the local representative of CanSino. “Just launched the Phase III trials for a COVID-19 vaccine in Pakistan,” said the minister for planning, Asad Umar, who also oversees command and control operations headed by the country’s military to combat the coronavirus outbreak. He said a total of 40,000 people across seven countries will participate in the trial, including up to 10,000 in Pakistan. Initial results are expected in four to six months, the minister said in a tweeted statement. The trial began at a hospital in Islamabad, where 20-25 subjects were expected to be enrolled daily, and will expand to several other cities in the coming days, Hassan Abbas Zaheer, who is heading the trial for AJM, told Reuters. “Our team is there and they have told us a lot of people have turned up to participate, and it is very encouraging,” Zaheer said. Daily positive cases of the virus in Pakistan peaked at more than 6,000 in June but have since fallen sharply, with only 582 new cases confirmed on Tuesday - taking the total to 306,886 with 6,424 deaths. The South Asian nation of 220 million has been carrying out between 20,000 and 36,000 tests daily. The World Health Organization has said it appreciated Pakistan’s efforts to combat the virus, although analysts say the exact reasons for the steep drop in infections are yet to be determined in a country where the public pays scant regard to precautions. Pakistan’s schools have started a phased reopening this month, with almost all sectors already back to business except for cinemas, theatres and swimming pools.","Sport & Life

China to step up financial support for supply chains," BEIJING (Reuters) - China will step up support for key firms engaged in supply chains in advanced manufacturing, services and trade sectors, the central bank and other state agencies said in guidelines issued on Tuesday, amid a deepening rift with the United States. The financial support will be provided through credit, bonds and other financing tools, and banks and other financial institutions should respond promptly to meet the needs of core, strategic firms, the guidelines said. China has boasted the most complete manufacturing supply chains in the world, but tension with the United States has exposed China’s vulnerability as it relies heavily on U.S. high-tech products, such as semiconductors. To reduce this exposure, China has unveiled a “dual circulation” strategy to steer industry towards relying more on domestic markets and technology to secure its supply chains.","Sport & Life

Expected bank merger wave puts Deutsche Bank on stand-by," FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is preparing for a wave of mergers, its finance chief said on Tuesday, in a potential change for Germany’s biggest lender, which has been focused firmly on a turnaround. Policymakers have long said Europe’s ailing banking sector needs to consolidate, but regulatory and political obstacles have hindered big deals over the past decade. This year, however, has seen major domestic bank tie-ups in Italy and Spain, with bankers saying regulators are now more willing to wave deals through. ""Already since late (2019), and since COVID, things are crystal clear,"" UBS UBSG.S Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti told an annual Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference. “The train left the station in that sense, and consolidation is inevitable,” Ermotti said, adding that Europe faced the risk of its banks becoming too small to survive or compete. Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE chief financial officer James von Moltke said it supported the ""appropriate or valid industrial logic"" of mergers among the region's larger banks. “We’ve been very focused on executing on our own strategy, and we think that strategy would prepare us to engage in merger activity when the time comes and the right opportunities arise,” von Moltke said at the same “virtual” financials conference. “So we are expecting this wave but we are also working hard to prepare on our side,” he said. MERGER ‘CHALLENGES’ There has been growing speculation about a potential deal in Switzerland, heightened last week when the board of UBS, which last year held brief tie-up talks with Deutsche Bank, gathered to discuss strategy. UBS recently examined a potential deal with Credit Suisse, whose executives also expect consolidation. Ermotti, who is due to be replaced at UBS by former ING INGA.AS head Ralph Hamers in November, declined comment on any role the Swiss bank might play in the consolidation. Mergers would be positive for the industry, so long as tie-ups were complementary, he added. Only last year Deutsche Bank called off merger talks with domestic rival Commerzbank CBKG.DE and von Moltke said domestic mergers ""frankly present some challenges"". Raimund Roeseler, who oversees banking supervision at German financial regulator BaFin, said mergers could be helpful, but were not always the solution. “Do we really believe that the problems of the German banking market would be solved if we only had 700 or 500 banks instead of 1,400? I don’t think so,” he told another banking conference.","Sport & Life

Oil edges up a day after selloff; rangebound ahead of U.S. crude stocks data," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of weekly U.S. inventory figures, rebounding modestly from the previous day’s selloff that was driven by a surge in overseas coronavirus infections. Analysts said renewed lockdown restrictions in Europe will have only a limited impact on fuel demand, which could prevent a pronounced selloff in oil markets. With major oil-producing nations still restricting supply, the market has been locked in a range for most of the summer. Brent crude LCOc1 rose 28 cents to settle at $41.72 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) CLc1 for October, which expires Tuesday, settled up 29 cents to $39.60. “The energy complex appears immune to negative news regarding the virus while case counts don’t increase enough to force renewed widespread lockdowns,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois. Fuel demand is expected to falter in countries such as Great Britain, where the government is telling people to work from home again and imposing curbs on bars and restaurants. Infections are rising in several other European countries, including France and Spain. “As any new restrictions will likely be more localized, the oil demand recovery should still continue, although at a slower pace with the easiest demand gains behind us,” UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. The easing of an oil blockade in Libya also pressured prices on Monday, but analysts said they expected Libyan exports were unlikely to quickly reach the levels seen before the conflict. Traders were acting cautious ahead of industry data from the American Petroleum Institute on U.S. oil inventories due later on Tuesday, according to Bob Yawger, director of energy futures for Mizuho in New York. Official data will follow on Wednesday. U.S. crude oil and gasoline stocks likely fell last week, while distillate inventories, including diesel, are expected to have risen, Reuters polling showed.","Sport & Life

"""British-style"" rules for banks after Brexit, says BoE"," LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will adopt tough but less bureaucratic financial rules after Brexit, starting with simpler regulation of small banks, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Tuesday. Britain will soon unveil new legislation for regulating the City of London, which for decades has complied with rules written in Brussels that end in December, when Brexit transition arrangements expire. Leaving the European Union has raised hopes of a regulatory “Brexit dividend” that will help banks and insurers in Europe’s biggest financial centre maintain global competitiveness. “We should approach that in the spirit of, let’s have high standards here in London and here in the UK, but let’s get back to a more British way of doing that regulation -- things that can be tough but less bureaucratic,” Woods told a City Week online event. When Britain comes to applying remaining global bank capital rules known as Basel III, it will be “exactly in that format”, he said, adding that the BoE would propose simpler rules for smaller lenders in a month or so. “It would have been impossible to agree in the European context as one person’s big bank is another person’s small bank,” Woods said. Katharine Braddick, director general, financial services at Britain’s finance ministry, said much thought had been given to what makes the City competitive. “Openness is at the core of our competitive offering,” Braddick said, adding this does not mean a “free for all”: “It means we have a set of access regimes that are becoming more comprehensive and over which we have more control.” The financial sector in Britain faces losing much of its access to the 27-nation EU, its biggest single customer, while also fighting the pandemic. “In terms of the financial sector through the crisis so far, so far so good is my feeling about it,” Woods said.","Sport & Life

Tesla warns on challenges of scaling up production," FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk warned on Tuesday about the difficulties of speeding up production as an expert cautioned the carmaker’s increased reliance on large-scale aluminium parts could bring new manufacturing challenges. While carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz have said automation has limitations, Musk has pressed on with plans to create a hyper-automated factory, which he refers to as the “alien dreadnought”, or “the machine that builds the machine”. “The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1,000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself,” Musk said on Twitter. Musk’s warning comes ahead of a “battery day” later on Tuesday, when Tesla is expected to unveil steps to boost battery production. For its new Model Y, Tesla plans to replace 70 components glued and riveted into the car’s rear underbody with a single module made using the world’s biggest aluminium casting machine in its new factory in Brandenburg, near Berlin. Car bodies have traditionally been made by assembling multiple stamped metal panels, a technique which has helped create crumple zones to absorb energy during a crash, but Musk is charting a new course at the Brandenburg plant. While casting could reduce the number of assembly steps, larger aluminium parts are more prone to deformation, according to Professor Martin Fehlbier at Kassel University in Germany. “On paper it looks easy,” said Fehlbier, a former head of foundry technology at Volkswagen Group, which pioneered aluminium construction techniques at its Audi brand. “The small details can cause you to burn through a lot of cash.” The larger the part, the more attention needs to be paid to heating the form, since molten aluminium needs to fill out the cast, Fehlbier said, adding the thinner the part being made, the more likely the metal will cool before filling out the form. By contrast, the hotter the form, the longer the component has to cool before the next manufacturing step, which can limit the overall speed of production, Fehlbier said. Cooling aluminium too quickly can lead a component to deform, and changing the consistency of the metal has huge implications for the cost of each component as well as on potential crash test behaviour, he added. “The Audi A8 has started to use more steel parts because a new side crash test in the United States cannot be passed using just aluminium,” Fehlbier said. It’s not the first time Tesla has faced challenges with new production techniques. The electric carmaker was forced to fly in a new production line from Germany to Nevada in 2018 to fix a manufacturing line after robots failed to coordinate seamlessly.","Sport & Life

"As cash flees Macau junkets, gambling hub faces long odds of quick recovery"," HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fears China is broadening a crackdown on offshore gambling has sparked a rush to withdraw billions of dollars from the world’s biggest gambling hub Macau, threatening a recovery in the coronavirus-stricken economy, executives say. An unprecedented stampede to withdraw money from junkets – companies which lure high rollers to gamble – started in July after Beijing identified the cross-border flow of funds for gambling as a national security risk. Worryingly, the customer withdrawals have spilled into the broader casino industry, leading to a cash crunch in Macau’s VIP sector at a time the Chinese territory is struggling to recover from COVID-19 restrictions which has sent tourist numbers and gambling revenues plummeting. “This is not millions we are talking about being taken out here, but billions,” said a casino executive who was not authorised to speak to the media. “We have cash in the bank but with everyone withdrawing, it’s a problem.” Several other executives also told Reuters that cash was being taken out in the billions of Hong Kong dollars. While Macau casinos have ample reserves to ride out several months of zero revenues, the rising cash withdrawals point to a major loss of confidence in the crucial VIP junket sector in a further blow to the economy, analysts said. The sector accounts for around 50% of overall gambling revenues, which hit $36.5 billion last year. The pandemic has already ravaged the economy with gambling revenues down around 96% in the second quarter year-on-year. The withdrawals began when hundreds of customers tried to pull deposits from top junket Suncity, at its VIP clubs across Macau, over fears it was being targeted by Chinese authorities. Suncity denied the allegations. The group then began restricting withdrawals, sparking a panic rush by customers seeking to pull their money from all junkets, executives said. Suncity said it was acting in compliance with new casino policies, but declined to elaborate. Junkets in the former Portuguese colony are licensed to provide customers with chip deposits and withdrawal services on behalf of casinos Sands China, Wynn Macau, MGM China, Galaxy Entertainment, SJM Holdings and Melco Resorts. All casinos declined Reuters requests to comment. As customers started pulling out money amid fears of a broader crackdown by Beijing, junket agents in turn have begun taking back deposits from the casinos. Casinos have reacted by putting limits on the amount of cash chips that can be withdrawn, executives said. “The crackdown on the cross border transactions have finally rammed home the inconvenient fact that Macau has always been dependent on outflow of funds from the mainland,” said Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX. Gambling is illegal on the mainland, but is allowed in casinos in Macau. In some casinos, customers can now only withdraw HK$1 million ($129,039) compared with HK$5 million in recent months and only the account holder can withdraw, say executives. Any transaction over HK$200,000 is now flagged, leading to people carrying around HK$5 million in chips in multiple sets of $10,000 to avoid detection. With thousands cashing out chips, some cash machines and exchange desks around Macau have briefly showed limited or no availability in recent weeks. Macau’s monetary authority told Reuters the supply of Hong Kong dollars is “currently” stable and that it has taken measures to ensure the adequate supply of currency. The withdrawals come as China fully resumes Macau tourist visas from Sept. 23, and executives warn that more arrivals could mean more cash being pulled out. Some Suncity customers, angry at not being able to get their funds, have started an online group called Suncity victims’ and are planning a protest on Sept. 23 at VIP rooms across Macau.

Bank of England's Bailey warns rising COVID cases will hurt economy," LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned on Tuesday that escalating COVID-19 cases threatened the outlook for Britain’s economy but pushed back against speculation that the central bank could soon cut interest rates below zero. There were “hard yards” to come and the BoE would do everything it could to support the economy, Bailey said at an online talk hosted by the British Chambers of Commerce. New COVID-19 cases are rising by at least 6,000 a day in Britain, according to week-old data, hospital admissions are doubling every eight days, and the testing system is buckling. “We’re very unfortunately seeing a much faster and larger return of COVID. Obviously that does reinforce the downside risks we see in our forecast,” Bailey said. The government said on Tuesday that pubs and restaurants must shut by 10 p.m. from Thursday onwards, and urged people to work from home where possible, reversing its previous call for employees to return to offices. Last week the BoE said the economy had been recovering faster than it had expected in August, but that a resurgence in coronavirus cases could derail this. Britain’s difficulty reaching a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union, and broader global trade tensions, were also risks, Bailey added. Bailey said parts of the retail sector and the housing market had been performing strongly, but he was concerned the underlying rate of unemployment was higher than the most recent 4.1% official figure for the three months to July. The BoE forecasts unemployment will rise to 7.5% later this year, after a government job support programme ends next month. Bailey said the furlough scheme had been useful, but any replacement was for finance minister Rishi Sunak to decide on. Last week the BoE said it would look into how in practice it could take interest rates below zero -- something Bailey and other policymakers said previously was an option. Some people in financial markets read this as a signal that the BoE was growing more enthusiastic about negative rates, which put downward pressure on sterling, but Bailey rejected that on Tuesday. “It doesn’t imply anything about the possibility of us using negative instruments,” he said. “We have looked hard at the question of what scope is to cut interest rates further and particularly negative interest rates.” Sterling rallied around a cent against the U.S. dollar and a similar amount against the euro after Bailey’s comments. “It’s not at all clear that (negative rates are) going to work for the UK economy. But I think the Bank will have a better line of sight on whether it needs to do more come that Nov. 5 meeting,” said Gavin Friend, FX strategist at NAB Group. The Japanese and euro zone central banks have cut rates below zero to encourage banks to lend instead of holding cash. Bailey described other countries’ experiences of negative rates as a “mixed bag”, with their effectiveness depending on the structure of the banking system and the timing of the move. Cutting below zero would hurt banks’ profits and potentially their readiness to lend, the BoE has said -- and could create problems with old computer systems not designed to accept negative rates.","Sport & Life

German economy's Covid hit may be smaller than feared," BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany may weather its pandemic-induced recession better than expected, private sector indicators suggested on Tuesday, in a hopeful sign for the economy that traditionally serves as Europe’s driver of growth. With much economic activity still constrained by COVID-19, Germany’s government moved swiftly to boost spending and that cash, along with another shot in the arm from the European Central Bank, appears to have cushioned the pandemic’s impact. Gross domestic product is now only seen shrinking by 5.2% this year, the Ifo institute projected, more optimistic than its previous estimate for a 6.7% drop and the Bundesbank’s 7.1% forecast. “The decline in the second quarter and the recovery are currently developing more favourably than we had expected,” Ifo chief economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said. For 2021 it cut its growth forecast to 5.1% from 6.4%, but even that indicates that Germany’s economy could be close to its pre-crisis level by the end of next year. The ECB still expects the euro zone as a whole to need a further year to make up the decline. Part of the forecast improvement is unexpectedly resilient consumption, and the HDE retail association said it expects nominal retail sales to grow by 1.5% this year, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate for a 4% drop. However, both it and the Ifo pointed to unusual uncertainty in their projections, with a second wave of infections and potential government restrictions seen as risk factors. HDE said online sales and stimulus measures that have included a temporary VAT cut and cash handouts for parents, had been key factors in boosting private consumption, HDE said. Job protection schemes were also maintaining relatively high employment levels, and keeping a lid on household income losses. Unemployment has barely risen compared to some other major economies and the rise in the jobless rate may top out at just 5.9% this year from 5.0% last year, before dropping to 5.7% percent in 2021, Ifo said.","Sport & Life

"Investors brace for months of big market swings as virus, political worries loom"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for an extended period of market volatility as worries over a potential resurgence in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty roil stocks. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as “Wall Street’s fear gauge,” hit its highest level in nearly two weeks as concerns over waning fiscal stimulus and the long-term economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic took the S&P 500 down to a seven-week low on Monday. Market participants aren’t expecting the turbulence to die down any time soon. VIX futures show that investors are betting that market swings will persist beyond the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election and into December, reflecting worries about the possibility of a contested election and concerns that a deeply divided government will fail to agree on providing more fiscal stimulus to support the U.S. economy. Other possible stumbling blocks for U.S. stocks include re-escalating tensions between the United States and China, as well as a potential increase of global coronavirus cases that could once again lead to broad economic shutdowns. The ramped up concerns are a sharp departure from the summer months, when signs of healing in the U.S. economy and expectations of more fiscal stimulus took markets to record highs after their brutal March sell-off. “There are a lot of different unknowns out there, and we just don’t know what that translates into,” said Oliver Pursche, president at Bronson Meadows Capital Management. “That’s going to stick with us a little bit longer.” Concerns over U.S. political uncertainty have recently been sharpened by the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which observers expect to deepen partisan divides as it sets up what promises to be a fierce fight in the Senate over President Donald Trump’s eventual nominee to replace her. Such a battle could hamper the bipartisan effort needed to pass additional federal coronavirus relief. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, among others, has stated that the U.S. economic recovery requires additional fiscal support. Such measures have been built into many economic and market forecasts for next year, and its continued absence could lead to further pullbacks in U.S. equities, some investors say. “It’s very hard to see how a compromise on another stimulus bill is reached in the next six to eight weeks,” said Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC. Lemonides is betting on declines in the stocks of several financial companies, including Wisdom Tree Investments Inc WETF.O and Cohen & Steers Inc CNS.N, which he believes are trading at valuations that assume a steep improvement in the economy. Ginsburg’s death could also weigh on shares of managed healthcare companies as it increases the likelihood that the Affordable Care Act could be struck down, according to a note from UBS Global Wealth Management. A new challenge to the law comes before the Supreme Court in November. The health care sector already trades at its largest valuation discount to the S&P 500 in at least 30 years, a report from Goldman Sachs said last week. More broadly, however, “it’s not just Election Day that matters to this market,” said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management. “It’s also ‘do we get fiscal stimulus or do we not?’”","Sport & Life

"Uneven progress among members hampers EU's digital ambitions, auditors warn"," BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s bet on advanced technologies to help its companies and the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic faces hurdles ahead, held back by the uneven digital pace across the 27-country block, the EU’s budget watchdog warned on Tuesday. Four years after launching a scheme called Digitising European Industry (DEI) to speed up the digitalisation of EU businesses, Europe is still not fully benefiting from advanced technologies, the European Court of Auditors said. The project aims to mobilise about 50 billion euros ($58.6 billion) in public and private investment over the next five years. The Luxembourg-based ECA, which vets the collection and use of EU funds, said the stakes are high as digitalisation could generate more than 110 billion euros ($129 billion) in annual revenues. “Digitalisation of EU industries has progressed in recent years, but at different speeds between countries, regions and sectors. There are also large disparities between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises,” it said in a statement. ECA cited the example of Germany whose digital strategy includes the building of a technology and know-how centre targeting the automotive and robotics industries, and helping small companies. It said Portugal also has a strategy in place to invest in automation and robotisation and the production of contemporary furniture of innovative design, among other projects. Hungary and Poland on the other hand had yet to develop a comprehensive strategy last year, the ECA said, as it lamented the limited influence Commission activities have on national plans. It said the slow and uneven take-up of fast broadband among companies was another reason holding back the digital roll-out. To accelerate its pace, EU countries should be matched with available EU funds, the DEI scheme better monitored, an EU-wide network of digital innovation hubs set up, and more measures needed to boost broadband usage, the ECA said.

"Beijing unlikely to approve Oracle, Walmart's TikTok deal: Global Times"," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is unlikely to approve an “unfair” deal Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc said they have struck with ByteDance over the future of video-streaming app TikTok, the state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial. The U.S. majors have said they would buy into a new mainly U.S.-owned company, TikTok Global, with a board of directors comprised mainly of Americans, as the parties work to pacify the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which had planned to ban TikTok in the United States on security grounds. In contrast, ByteDance has said TikTok Global would be its U.S. subsidiary with 80% ownership. “It is clear that these articles (terms) extensively show Washington’s bullying style and hooligan logic. They hurt China’s national security, interests and dignity,” the newspaper said in an editorial in its English edition published late on Monday. It was also carried in its Chinese edition. “From the information provided by the U.S., the deal was unfair. It caters to the unreasonable demands of Washington. It’s hard for us to believe that Beijing will approve such an agreement,” it said, echoing comments on Twitter the same evening from its editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin. Hu on Tuesday, responding to comments Trump made to Fox News about how TikTok Global was going to be “totally controlled” by Oracle, said on Twitter: “Stop extorting. You think TikTok is a company from a small country?” “There’s no way the Chinese government will accept your demand. You can ruin TikTok’s U.S. business, if U.S. users do not object, but you can’t rob it and turn it into a U.S. baby.” The Global Times is a tabloid published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and government unlike its parent publication. China’s government has largely refrained from directly commenting on the deal’s details, though the foreign ministry has said the United States should offer a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies. Reuters reported this month, citing sources, that Beijing opposed a forced sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations by ByteDance, and would prefer to see the short video app shut down in the United States. The deal requires approval from regulators in both Beijing and Washington, ByteDance has said. China’s Ministry of Commerce in late August revised a tech export control list that experts said would give it regulatory oversight over any TikTok deal. ByteDance and the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Over the weekend, ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart said they had reached a deal that would satisfy Trump’s call for TikTok to be sold to an American firm or be shut down in the United States. However, the sides have framed the deal differently in public statements. Whereas ByteDance said it will majority-own TikTok Global, Oracle and Walmart together said ByteDance’s ownership would be distributed to its investors - many of which are U.S.-based - and that ByteDance itself would have no direct stake. They also said four of TikTok Global’s five-member board would be American. The unidentified author of the Global Times editorial objected to there being only one board seat reserved for a Chinese national, as well as the stipulated inclusion on the board of a U.S-approved “national security director”. It also denounced the need for ByteDance to reveal source code to Oracle as part of the latter’s role of “trusted technology partner” and criticised the likelihood of TikTok Global blocking Chinese access to its app. TikTok has never been available in China. It has said it has more than 100 million monthly active U.S. users, compared with 600 million daily users at mainland equivalent Douyin. “As TikTok and Douyin should have the same source code, this means the U.S. can get to know the operations of Douyin,” the Global Times said. “If the reorganization of TikTok under U.S. manipulation becomes a model, it means once any successful Chinese company expands its business to the U.S. and becomes competitive, it will be targeted by the U.S. and turned into a U.S.-controlled company via trickery and coercion, which eventually serves only U.S. interests.” Beijing-based ByteDance has only two Chinese nationals on its five-member board, with the other three being foreigners running U.S.-based companies. ByteDance has also said Oracle’s ability to inspect TikTok’s source code before investing is akin to previous instances of U.S. companies such as Microsoft Corp sharing source code with Chinese technology experts.","Sport & Life

China should raise costs to deter speculative foreign money - People's Daily," SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China should raise the costs of short-term, cross-border money flows to buffer its financial markets from speculative capital, said Zhu Min, head of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, as cited by the People’s Daily. Zhu, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also said China should step up monitoring cross-border trading activities to maintain market stability, China’s official daily newspaper reported on Tuesday. Against a backdrop of great economic and financial uncertainty, and with increasing links between global markets, “the volume and speed of cross-border capital flows are unprecedented,” Zhu told the newspaper in an interview. “This will not only result in sustained fluctuations in major world currencies, but will also lead to higher volatility in global financial markets. Therefore, we must be prepared for potential risks.” Zhu’s cautionary comments come amid signs that foreign money has been flowing into Chinese markets at an accelerated pace, lured by the country’s early economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis and its attractive bond yields. The yuan has been strengthening against the U.S. dollar over the past several months, a trend Zhu said will likely continue, citing the Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping U.S. interest rates at near-zero levels. Zhu said many countries crossed a “red line”, implementing unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies to avoid financial and economic collapses during the coronavirus pandemic, increasing uncertainty. Zhu’s view echoed that of Sheng Songcheng, a former Chinese central bank official who told a forum last week that China should closely monitor large short-term capital inflows and the risk of a rapid yuan appreciation.","Sport & Life

Swiss National Bank to stay loyal to ultra-loose policy: Reuters poll," ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank will hold firm to its expansive stance and negative 0.75% interest rate when it meets to review monetary policy on Thursday, a Reuters poll showed. All 31 economists polled by Reuters expected Chairman Thomas Jordan to stick with the ultra-loose monetary policy the central bank has followed for the five years since scrapping its peg to the euro. The next change was not expected for years as the SNB attempts to prevent more strengthening in the safe haven Swiss franc which could further hurt the Swiss economy, already in a recession caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Economists in the Sept. 16-21 poll were also unanimous the SNB would keep the interest rate on sight deposits locked down at negative 0.75% and continue currency interventions to block the franc’s rise. “I expect the SNB to continue with its two pillar approach for the foreseeable future,” said Gero Jung, chief economist at Mirabaud. “Since March we have seen a significant strengthening of the euro against the dollar, but the euro-Swiss franc exchange rate has not changed that much, which means it is still a concern for the SNB.” Even as the central bank’s balance sheet expands to nearly 1 trillion Swiss francs ($1.1 trillion), many of the economists expected it to keep buying foreign currencies at the current rate of 1 to 2 billion Swiss francs per week. They said the SNB could accelerate interventions if pressure on the franc increases. “I suppose at some point rates will have to go up, but that won’t be within my forecast horizon,” said Charlotte de Montpellier, an economist at ING. “In the meantime, the SNB will continue to act on the foreign exchange markets and hope for better days.”","Sport & Life

Creditors take action against UAE's Al Jaber in decade-long saga," DUBAI (Reuters) - Creditors have started to enforce claims against Abu Dhabi-based Al Jaber Group, in a dispute triggered by a construction downturn in the United Arab Emirates more than a decade ago. Al Jaber, a contractor with interests across a range of sectors, has struggled since building up debt in the wake of a UAE real estate crisis and began talks with creditors in 2011. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank ADCB.AD, which is working as restructuring and security agent, said in a document dated Sept. 21 which was seen by Reuters, that it had instructions from the majority of creditors to proceed with claims against Al Jaber. A representative for Al Jaber did not immediately respond to a request or comment. ADCB declined to comment. The move follows delays in restructuring agreements, under which Al Jaber was to appoint a new board and sell companies and assets such as the Shangri-La hotels in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In exchange, creditors had agreed to extend the maturity of a 5.9 billion dirhams ($1.61 billion) loan, cut interest rates, and provide additional revolving debt. The initial enforcement action now being pursued by creditors includes the “acceleration and demand for payment of amounts outstanding” under the previously agreed debt restructuring, a source familiar with the matter said. Enforcement will also allow creditors to claim against Al Jaber’s chairman under a 4.5 billion dirham loan to the company. Several UAE companies have sought to extend debt maturities or agree better terms in recent years to avoid defaults, after an oil price crash hit energy services and construction. The coronavirus crisis has added to the strain and Arabtec Holding ARTC.DU, the UAE's biggest listed contractor, this week will discuss options including dissolution after the pandemic hit projects and led to additional costs. Meanwhile, Dubai-listed construction firm Drake & Scull DSI.DU is working under the UAE bankruptcy law to reach an agreement with its creditors in an out-of-court process.","Sport & Life

COVID-19 vaccine makers see EU shield against side-effect claims," BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Vaccine makers will be indemnified in Europe if their COVID-19 shots cause unexpected side-effects, an industry official said on Tuesday, urging European regulators to set up more predictable schemes to compensate possible victims. The European Commission has confidential liability clauses in contracts signed with AstraZeneca AZN.L and Sanofi SASY.PA and is negotiating similar conditions with other firms for the advance purchase of their potential vaccines. Sue Middleton, President of the Executive Board of Vaccines Europe which represents top vaccine makers, told a European Parliament hearing that in case of unexpected adverse events, which could include unpredicted side-effects, she understood that there was indemnification. “The Commission or the member states would essentially indemnify the companies against the cost of legal action that followed those claims,” she said, adding that these events were rare and that she had not seen all contracts signed so far. A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment specifically on Middleton’s remarks, but said advance purchase deals “provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions” but “liability still remains with the companies”. Officials have said partial legal protection offered by the EU hampered advance purchase deals in past months and prompted vaccine makers to ask for more. Consumer organisations and lawmakers insist companies should be liable for all potential side-effects. The comments come after Russia told Reuters it was so confident its vaccine was safe that it would shoulder the liability for anything going wrong, leaving the state-backed developers open to potentially costly compensation claims. The United States also offer a full liability coverage to vaccine makers because widespread inoculation against disease is considered a benefit to society. Middleton also called for no-fault compensation in all 27 EU states for COVID-19 vaccines which would speed up resolution of legal disputes. Such a system is in place in 11 countries, but its application to COVID-19 vaccine cases is not always clear, she said. The no-fault system would reduce legal uncertainties and costs to companies. These schemes also allow citizens to claim more quickly payments for injuries that followed vaccinations or treatments, but compensation is capped and is usually far below what can typically be awarded in a successful product liability lawsuit. The World Health Organisation has made it clear to countries interested in joining its COVAX facility for vaccine purchases that pharmaceutical firms may ask for no-fault schemes. It has not committed to opposing them in negotiations with vaccine makers. No COVID-19 vaccine has yet been authorised in Europe, with clinical trials underway. But contacts between vaccine makers and regulators are ongoing to speed up possible authorisations. The World Health Organisation lists 38 candidate vaccines in late-stage trials, including those from China and Russia. Another 149 are in pre-clinical evaluation. “As of early September the EMA has been in contact with developers of 38 potential COVID-19 vaccines,” Fergus Sweeney, head of clinical studies and manufacturing task force at the European Medicines Agency, told EU lawmakers. Under a faster “rolling review”, vaccine makers can share data with EMA on their trials as they happen, so that shots could be authorised more quickly when all data is available. No rolling review has yet began on vaccines, Sweeney said, adding the agency was expecting that to begin in the coming weeks. EMA must authorise vaccines before they can be used in the EU.","Sport & Life

Unwanted delivery: Rappi spawns black market in worker accounts," BOGOTA (Reuters) - As Rappi has grown in Latin America, particularly in its home country of Colombia, so too has a shadow market for the all-purpose delivery firm’s worker profiles. Rappi, a play on ""rapido"" the Spanish word for fast, has gained some 150,000 active contractors known as ""Rappitenderos"" and $1 billion in backing from Japan's SoftBank 9434.T since it was founded by three entrepreneurs in 2015. But in a country where urban unemployment jumped to nearly 25% in July, up from just over 13% in March following coronavirus restrictions, and more than a quarter of the population lives in poverty, work as a Rappitendero is highly sought after. Against this backdrop a black market where fake profiles are sold for as much as $160 apiece has emerged, including on social media platforms such as Facebook. Rappi told Reuters it “strongly condemned” any black market in its worker accounts. Facebook referred to its terms of use, which state that job posts must not promote illegal activity. SoftBank 9984.T declined to comment. Rappi also said in a statement that it has a dedicated fraud team monitoring illicit activities and is building a tool alongside police to verify worker accounts in real time. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Rappitenderos in Colombia, where some 50,000 work, who said there was a roaring black market trade in profiles. Four said they had bought one of these accounts themselves. “I had to buy an account. I’m the head of my household. I have my son, I have a wife,” said one, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions. All the Rappitenderos, many of whom are Venezuelan migrants, said the black market was fueled by cancellations of their profiles by Rappi, with people now paying to be able to work. Under Rappi’s terms and conditions, messenger accounts can be blocked for violence against retailers, customers and other Rappitenderos, incorrect conduct when using the app and failing to maintain a high standard of service, among other reasons. Gabriel Carvallo, a Venezuelan migrant who is a mechanic by trade said that one day he had been working on Rappi deliveries without problems, but when he tried to log on the next day, he found his account had been frozen. “I received the same message as everyone else ‘your account is blocked for (breaking) terms and conditions’ - they don’t write, or warn you, or send you an email,” he said. Rappitenderos in Bogota recently called a one-day strike to protest against such blockages and a points system which determines who can work in areas of high demand. The Bogota-based company denied that any accounts had been blocked without justification, adding it had canceled 5,600 accounts in Colombia since March, of which 1,060 were due to “false identity issues”, a spokeswoman confirmed. It was not immediately clear who would investigate the trade in Colombia, where a spokesperson for Bogota police said fake accounts were a matter for regulators. The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce, which last year found Rappi failed to comply with orders to improve responses to complaints, advised contacting the police. Sales of Rappi accounts are not confined to Colombia. In Mexico, three people close to the matter told Reuters the practice was common. Accounts for sale for rivals Uber Eats and iFood also appeared on social media in Colombia and Brazil. Brazil-based iFood said in an email response to Reuters that passing accounts to third parties violated its terms and conditions. Uber Eats said in a statement it is constantly strengthening its systems to avoid account sharing or renting. While signing up officially to Rappi is free, Rappitenderos told Reuters that secondary accounts are typically offered by opaque contacts on Facebook groups, WhatsApp accounts and even by people in the street for $65 to $160 each. Sometimes people who are not working as Rappitenderos are paid to set up profiles before passing them on, two of the workers said. One person purporting to sell Rappi profiles, contacted by Reuters via WhatsApp, boasted in an automated reply of selling more than 300 profiles over three years. A person responding to messages to a second WhatsApp account said their clients had no problem working via the Rappi application once an account had been purchased. Reuters could not verify if the accounts were connected or how many accounts they had sold. As well as offers to sell Rappi accounts, dozens of Facebook posts across multiple group pages advertise services for users, such as changing registered modes of transport from bikes to motorcycles or cars. One woman who said she had worked for a year selling upgrades and other services to those with black-market accounts, described the secrecy involved. “You’re never close to, or know the person, who makes changes in-app,” she said. “I don’t know how that’s handled. No one knows if it’s someone in the office, or someone hacking. Many of us aren’t interested in who does it - that’s irrelevant.”","Sport & Life

Exclusive: 'We're confident' - Russia to share legal risks of COVID-19 vaccine," MOSCOW/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Russia is so confident in its COVID-19 vaccine that it will shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong, rather than requiring buyers to take on the full risk, the head of the state fund bankrolling the project told Reuters. The decision leaves the vaccine’s state-backed developers open to potentially costly compensation claims should there be any unexpected side-effects. It is something many vaccine-makers have sought to avoid, by asking for full indemnity - complete protection from liability claims - from nations they sell to. The approach is different from many places in the world. In the United States, for example, liability for COVID-19 vaccines has been shifted fully to the U.S. government. This shields the developers because widespread inoculation against the disease is considered a benefit to society. With the global vaccine race hotting up, and dozens of candidates being tested on humans, backers of Russia’s ‘Sputnik-V’ shot see liability as a key battleground as they aim to capture market share. “Russia is so confident in its vaccine that it has not asked for full indemnity and this is a major differentiating factor versus any Western vaccine,” said Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the state sovereign wealth fund that is backing the vaccine. “All of them are asking for full indemnity of legal risks.” Dmitriev did not say whether buyers of the Russian vaccine would be asked to take on partial liability, and did not give details about indemnity clauses. His representatives said he had nothing more to add. However, the health secretary of the Brazilian state of Bahia, which plans to buy 50 million doses of Russia’s vaccine, told Reuters the legal risks would be carried by Russian entities. Vaccine developers around the world are compressing years of development into months, raising the possibility of unexpected consequences and making the issue of compensation claims a key point in supply deal negotiations. For example, British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L, which has developed a vaccine with Oxford University, has been granted full protection from any future liability claims by many countries with which it has signed supply deals, a senior executive told Reuters in July. Dmitriev’s comments came after some scientists expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of Sputnik-V, which the Russian government approved for use before completing large-scale human trials. Sputnik-V was developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, a state research body. The RDIF, which is marketing the vaccine abroad, will shoulder some of the legal risks in supply contracts along with pharmaceutical firms in the fund’s portfolio which are producing the shot. “We are confident in the long-term consequences,” Dmitriev said. “We are putting our money where our mouth is by not asking for full indemnity in partnerships we create in different countries.” Thus far, RDIF has announced deals to supply just over 200 million doses, half to Latin America and half to India. The fund says it has orders for as much as 1 billion doses. Fábio Vilas-Boas, health secretary of Brazil’s Bahia state, which is placing the 50-million-dose order, told Reuters the legal risks would be carried by the Russian pharmaceutical firms producing and supplying the vaccine. “In the case of any adverse event, nothing will stop people who feel they have been harmed from filing a class action against any of the pharmaceutical companies,” said Fábio Vilas-Boas, who negotiated the testing and letter of intent with RDIF. Neither Bahia nor Paraná, a Brazilian state which plans to conduct trials of Sputnik-V on 10,000 volunteers, have actually signed contracts for supply of the vaccine, according to Bahia’s Vilas-Boas and the Paraná state governor’s chief of staff, Guto Silva, who also negotiated with the Russian side. Thus far, deals have been formalised only in memorandums of understanding, as contracts are awaiting the vaccine’s approval by Brazil’s health regulators. Russia has staked its scientific reputation on the results after approving the vaccine for domestic use before mass testing had even begun, becoming the first country to licence a COVID-19 vaccine. Late-stage trials, known as Phase III, are currently ongoing in Russia, with at least 40,000 volunteers taking part. Initial results are expected in October or November. Volunteers in its Phase III trial are unpaid, but their insurance is covered, including a payout of 2 million roubles ($26,430) in case of death, one volunteer told Reuters. RDIF also expects to run trials of the vaccine abroad, with plans already in place with Indian pharmaceutical firm Dr Reddy’s and with Brazil’s Paraná state, both pending regulatory approval. Many people involved in the Sputnik-V’s development, including Dmitriev, have tried the jab on themselves in a bid to convince the world of the safety of a Russian-made vaccine. Dmitriev said he was not concerned about the risk of compensation claims against RDIF. “We know it will not happen. Because the vaccine has been studied for decades,” he said. “We know we will not have ... billions and billions of liabilities because we have a proven platform and they don’t,” he said. “Simple.”","Sport & Life

Popular game arcade Smaaash shuts down as pandemic hits business - sources," BENGALURU (Reuters) - Popular Indian gaming and entertainment centre operator Smaaash Entertainment is shutting down, according to an internal email and sources in the company, as few choose to hang out in its arcades amid surging coronavirus cases. The company, which has counted cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador for years, operates in more than 40 locations across 19 cities in India and used to be a popular hangout for urban teens and tweens before coronavirus lockdowns and fears forced them indoors. In a letter to the company’s employees dated Sept. 15 and reviewed by Reuters, founder Shripal Morakhia said, “I am sorry that despite my best efforts I have failed in my efforts to save the company from its premature death.” The email did not give other details. Smaaash, which offered popular pastimes like bowling, cricket, dance-off and other games, did not get funding from investors, Morakhia said. He did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on phone, email and LinkedIn. Smaaash’s shutdown comes just months after media reports said the company crossed 3 billion rupees in sales in 2019 about seven years after it opened its first outlet. The Economic Times had earlier reported about the closure of the company.","Sport & Life

Singapore central bank 'closely studying' reports on suspicious bank transfers," SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said on Tuesday that it was ‘closely studying’ media reports that Singapore banks had informed U.S. regulators of suspicious transactions. The move came as global banks faced a fresh scandal about dirty money on Monday as they sought to limit the fallout from a cache of leaked documents showing they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades. Banks from many countries were named in the report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and based on leaked documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. The report was based on 2,100 leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs), covering transactions between 1999 and 2017, filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). “MAS is aware that Singapore banks were mentioned in media reports on suspicious transaction reports filed with FinCEN,” the city-state’s central bank said in an email on Tuesday. “Although suspicious transaction reports in and of themselves do not imply that the transactions are illicit, MAS takes such reports very seriously,” it said. It said it will take “appropriate action” based on the outcome of its review, adding that “Singapore’s regulatory framework to combat money laundering meets international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.”","Sport & Life

EU top court rejects Austrian appeal against UK Hinkley nuclear plant," BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top court on Tuesday rejected Austria’s appeal against a British subsidised nuclear plant, agreeing with EU competition regulators that government aid offered to Hinkley Point C nuclear power station was in line with EU state aid rules. The European Commission gave the green light to the project in 2014, triggering a court challenge from Austria which has opposed nuclear power for decades, and Luxembourg. “The Court of Justice confirms the Commission decision approving United Kingdom aid for Hinkley Point C nuclear power station,” the Luxembourg-based Court said. The case is C-594/18 P Austria v. Commission.","Sport & Life

Indonesia revises GDP forecast to deeper contraction for 2020," JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia revised down its 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) outlook on Tuesday, expecting a steeper contraction due to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic even as it tries to ramp up spending to cushion the blow. Southeast Asia’s largest economy would likely shrink within a range of 1.7% to 0.6% on an annual basis in 2020, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told a virtual news conference, down from her previous expectation of a range of 1.1% contraction to 0.2% growth. The forecast took into account a new third-quarter GDP outlook of a contraction of 2.9% to 1%, from the previous range of 2.1% to flat growth, and potential negative growth in October-December, the minister said. Indonesia’s GDP shrank for the first time since 1999 in April-June, by 5.32%. “Although we saw improvement in the third quarter and we could see the economy recovering ... it was still very early, fragile and must be guarded,” Sri Mulyani said, describing the recovery in some sectors as flattening based on August data. The minister said she hoped the semi-lockdown currently reinstated in Jakarta would not disrupt the economy too much and pledged the government would go “all out” to accelerate spending to support the economy. Bank Mandiri economist Andry Asmoro said the new forecast was closer to his 2020 outlook of a 2.2% yearly contraction, based on “a flattening recovery and a drop in transactions due to rising COVID cases”. Coronavirus cases in Indonesia rose by 4,176 on Monday, a fresh record daily increase that took the country’s total tally to 248,852, with 9,677 fatalities. The government had spent 56% of its 2020 budget in January-August, up 10.6% from last year, while state revenue had fallen 13.1%, with corporate tax payments under pressure, official data showed. As of August, the fiscal deficit was 3.05% of GDP. The full year deficit outlook may be wider than the previously expected 6.34% and the government would monitor its implications for debt issuance, Luky Alfirman, the finance ministry’s head of financing department said.","Sport & Life

Britain's Kingfisher sees profit rise on pandemic DIY mini boom," LONDON (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Kingfisher KGF.L reported a 23.1% rise in first half profit, driven by a strong sales recovery in its second quarter as consumers took to do-it-yourself (DIY) and gardening projects during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group, which owns B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France and other markets, said on Tuesday second quarter to July 31 like-for-like sales had increased 19.5%. “This recovery has continued into Q3 to date, with growth across all banners and categories,” said Chief Executive Thierry Garnier. “The crisis has prompted more people to rediscover their homes and find pleasure in making them better. It is creating new home improvement needs, as people seek new ways to use space or adjust to working from home,” he said. Kingfisher made an adjusted pretax profit of 415 million pounds ($531 million) in its first half - ahead of analysts’ expectations and up from 337 million pounds in the same period last year. Total sales fell 1.3% to 5.92 billion pounds, reflecting the impact of the virus in the first quarter when stores were closed. E-commerce sales soared 164% and now represent 19% of total sales versus 7% in the same period last year. “Looking forward, while the near term outlook is uncertain, the longer term opportunity for Kingfisher is significant,” added Garnier. Shares in Kingfisher, up 22% so far this year, closed Monday at 265 pence, valuing the business at 5.63 billion pounds.","Sport & Life

Agitation threat by students of Sikkim college," The students of Government Vocational College  at Dentam in West Sikkim have threatened to take the agitation path from September 12 if their long-pending demands, including introduction of post-graduate courses and permanent campus, are not met by the state government.
The college, which was set up in 2017 with under-graduate courses in tourism, software development and retail management, operates from a rented building and has a student-strength of 160. The first batch of 60-odd students would have graduated in June, but the final exams had to be postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Apart from starting PG courses and permanent campus, the other demands of the students are providing facilities like on-the job training, field trips, internships, workshops and industrial visits with financial support and provisions like laboratory, library, Internet and buses.
“From September 12, 2020, we the students of GVC Dentam are going to start a series of activities to press for the immediate fulfillment of our demands. This will go until all our demands are fulfilled unconditionally,” said the students in a release issued in Gangtok on Tuesday.
The students regretted that despite several petitions to both the previous and present governments, nothing had been done to address their issues. “Despite receiving verbal assurances from chief minister downwards, there has been no progress on the ground. The students have been rendered helpless as a result of the total negligence on the part of the concerned department and the government,” the students alleged.
Punyaprasad Sharma, the principal of GVC Dentam, said the permanent campus spread over seven acres was coming up, but admitted to the delay in construction because of various factors, including disruptions caused by the pandemic.
“The construction was started in 2019. Plinth level work is going on,” he said, adding the Union ministry of human resource development had sanctioned Rs 26 crore for the project.
Sharma said since the new campus would take time to be completed, a proposal was mooted to shift the college to a bigger building owned by the government at Dentam. “But the proposal has been stalled because of the pandemic.”",states
Three new faces join Sikkim cricket," The Sikkim Cricket Association (SICA) has engaged pacer Anureet Singh, batsman Md. Shahbaz Anwar and all-rounder Robin Bist for the 2020-2021 domestic season, including the prestigious Ranji Trophy.
The troika replaces Iqbal Abdullah, Yashpal Singh and Ishwar Chaudhary, who had donned the Sikkim colours last season.
According to the rules of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), states can hire a maximum of three guest players in their teams. Sikkim would be participating in the senior level of domestic cricket for the third year running after the SICA was granted full membership of the BCCI in 2018. The highlanders have not exactly set the stadium on fire in the previous seasons, but have been competitive on occasions, particularly in the shorter formats of the game.
Among the three new signings, Anureet has the most impressive record, having taken 249 wickets in 72 matches at an economy rate of just 2.73, including 16 five-wicket hauls, in first-class cricket so far. He also scored 1,209 runs in first-class cricket and played for three teams in the IPL.
Former Rajasthan skipper Bist is a right-hand middle-order batsman and an off-break bowler. He has scored over 6,000 runs in first-class cricket with 15 centuries and 34 half-centuries. In List A matches, he has over 1,200 runs in his kitty with the highest score of 109 not out.
Anwar, who is from Bengal, is the youngest of the three and was part of the Sikkim under-23 team last season. He had a prolific year, scoring 1,130 runs in nine matches in the Col. C.K. Nayudu Trophy, including five centuries and six half-centuries. In the shorter format, he had scored 406 runs in 9 matches, including a century and two half-centuries. Anureet said he was excited to be part of the team and was looking forward to sharing his experience with his new mates and learning from them as well. “Cricket is such a sport where there is always new things to learn. It is a never-ending process,” he added.
Bist, on his part, said he would be bringing in his winning experience, having been part of two Ranji Trophy triumphs. “I am looking forward to the upcoming season and I want to give my best,” he added.
SICA president Lobzang G. Tenzing congratulated the selectors for bringing on board the three talented players. “SICA has signed some of the consistent performers in domestic cricket and we believe they will keep the momentum going,” he said.",states
"Woman drowned, search on for siblings in Sikkim"," Three siblings in their 20s from Kazitar Dikchu in East Sikkim were swept away in river Bakcha on Saturday.
Only the body of one of the sisters was recovered on Sunday after a massive search operation.
Police quoting an eyewitness said Chandra Rai, 28, her sister Erika, 22, and a seven-year-old child had gone to the river for fun. They were joined later by the women’s brother Puran, 29.
While frolicking in a small waterfall, Puran slipped and fell into river Bakcha. When Chandra tried to rescue her brother, she got sucked in the water current. Seeing her siblings struggling, Erika jumped into the river. “Unfortunately, none of them knew how to swim and were swept away,” said a source.
On Sunday, Erika’s body was found. Search is on for Chandra and Puran.

Sikkim body ups ante on hospitals," The Sikkim Progressive Youth Forum has threatened to take to the streets if the government fails to upgrade facilities at state hospitals and ensure free medicine and health services by November 30.
In a release issued on Monday, SPYF said the government had failed to deliver on the twin demands despite the assurance given to the forum by health minister Dr M.K. Sharma in February. ""We have no choice other than to issue an ultimatum to the government to fulfill the twopoint demands within Nov 30 2020, else, we will take to the streets,"" said the forum.
In February, the SPYF had submitted a memorandum to the minister along with 10,000 signatures of the public in support of its demands for upgrading facilities at government hospitals according to the Indian Public Health Standard (IPHS) guidelines and provision for free medical services and medicines to the people. ‘Dr Sharma had assured us that our demands would be fulfilled within two months of the budget session, but the condition of the hospitals continue to remain the same even after five months of the budget session,’ it regretted.
The SPYF said district hospitals apart, even the condition of primary health centres was in a pathetic state. “The condition of PHCs is so bad that people hardly go there. They are only there in name,” it alleged.
The SPYF has been spearheading the campaign to upgrade health facilities in the state for two-and-a-half years. Besides the signature campaign, it had held mass movements on three different occasions. The forum had also organised ‘Gangtok Chalo’ march from Geyzing in West Sikkim to Gangtok in January 2019 to highlight the abysmal condition of the Geyzing District Hospital.",states
Ex-chief of Sikkim tourism body held under Pocso charges," Rup Narayan Rai, a former chairman of the Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation, was arrested on the charges of sexually assaulting a minor girl after he surrendered before South Sikkim police on Monday.
Rai, 53, had been absconding since Friday night after a family member of the victim had lodged a complaint of sexual assault against Rai at the Melli police station. The police had launched a search for Rai in South Sikkim.
Rai is alleged to have assaulted the 13-year-old at his house in Sadam village on several occasions. The girl from a remote village in the South Sikkim had been staying with his family for the past few months to pursue her education.
The police have said Rai has been booked under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. “He will be produced in a court in Namchi (South Sikkim) in 24 hours,” said Prawin Gurung, the deputy inspector general of police, Range.
The Sikkim Democratic Front, under whose government Rai had served as the STDC chairman, suspended him until the completion of the process of law.

Covid protocol breach case on duo in Sikkim," Sikkim police on Monday filed a case against two visiting technicians who tested positive for Covid-19 for allegedly violating the Covid-19 protocol and endangering the lives of others.
The duo were part of a five-member team from Calcutta and Delhi and visited Gangtok on August 6 for maintenance work at State Data Centre at the IT department’s invitation.
IT secretary Mrinalini Shrivastava sought special permission from the East Sikkim administration for the team’s entry. Granting permission, the district administration had stated that the team would have to undergo rapid antigen test at the entry point, and travel to their places of work and stay in an ambulance under police cover at all times.
During their week-plus stay, the team visited other places and met some MLAs, including Aditya Golay, son of chief minister P.S. Tamang (Golay), and bureaucrats at meetings facilitated by the IT department. Two team members tested positive on Sunday.
The police filed a case against the two under IPC sections for disobedience of public order and endangering lives of others, and for refusing to comply with the government directive under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
S. C. Gupta, the state’s chief secretary, sought an explanation from IT secretary Shrivastava on the issue.
Since some meetings took place at the Tashiling secretariat in Gangtok, the entire complex has been declared as a containment zone.
The incident created a furore in Sikkim with many wondering why the administration had not acted with same alacrity against politicians and bureaucrats as they did against the technician duo.",states
Don’t derail HIV combat: Forum," The Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum (SDUF) has expressed fears that HIV prevention activities may have taken a back seat in Sikkim because of an allegedly lax state health department amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Forum president Rinzing Bhutia said HIV prevention programme should not be derailed despite the prevailing Covid pandemic.
“An emerging public health crisis should not be the reason to derail the handling of an existing crisis,” she said.
Citing an example of the department’s alleged casual attitude, Bhutia said a counsellor attached to the oral substitute therapy (OST) centre at Jorethang Hospital and a technician at the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) at Namchi District Hospital were transferred over a year back, but their replacements had not yet arrived.
Even more perplexing is the fact that the two persons who had been transferred worked for the State AIDS Control Society under the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) of the Union health ministry, she said.
Bhutia added that the two persons who were transferred had been trained and experienced persons. Such transfers affect the continuity of effective HIV service deliveries, she said.
“Ideally, we would want the department to retransfer both to their original places of posting instead of giving replacements,” she added.
The SDUF president also said her organisation had written to Sikkim health minister M.K. Sharma on July 6 on the issue, but got no response.
“If there is no positive action on the issue, the health minister will be held accountable for any loss of life and the spread of new HIV infections in the state,” she warned.
Sources said Sikkim now has a little over 200 patients under antiretroviral therapy, or the HIV treatment regime.
The Telegraph could not contact the health minister on phone despite repeated attempts.
The Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum initiates community-led action for the health and rights of the people who use drugs.
The SDUF has said that during the Covid-induced lockdown in Sikkim, it has been “tirelessly delivering crucial life-saving medicines to people suffering from HIV”, among others.",states
Sikkim public figure CD Rai passes away," Sikkim politician, bureaucrat and journalist C.D. Rai died at the age of 96 at his Gangtok residence on Saturday night.
His mortal remains were cremated at the Jalipool Crematorium in East Sikkim on Sunday.
Rai served in different departments of the government of Sikkim during his time as a bureaucrat. Rai had also been a minister in the short-lived government of Tashi Thsering in 1949 when Sikkim was an independent kingdom.
In between and post-retirement, he engaged in journalism and was the Sikkim correspondent of the Calcutta-based Amrita Bazar Patrika in the early 1960s. He was also the editor of Himali Bela, a Nepali daily, and publisher of Gangtok Times.
Rai leaves behind a son, a daughter and grandchildren. His son, P. D. Rai, is a two-term parliamentarian and a senior leader of the Sikkim Democratic Front.
Chief minister P. S. Tamang (Golay) said in Rai’s passing away, Sikkim had lost one of its most famous and reputed sons. “The contribution made by him for Sikkim and the
people is unparalleled and his demise has created a dent in the intellectual society of Sikkim,” he added.
Governor Ganga Prasad said Rai had worn many hats with distinction during his long innings in public life. “He will be remembered for his immense contribution, and let the contribution made by Shri C. D Rai be (a) source of inspiration for new generations,” he said.
Former chief minister and SDF president Pawan Chamling, too, mourned the death of Rai.
 “Shri C.D. Rai’s death is a tremendous loss for Sikkim and he will be forever remembered for his contributions and service to our state. I express my heartfelt condolences to his family,” he said.",states
Sikkim rail link by 2022-end," Sikkim will be part of India’s rail map by 2022-end, Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) officials said, speaking about the long-delayed project whose foundation was laid in 2009 when Mamata Banerjee was the railways minister.
“With the sanction of new line work from Sevoke (Bengal) up to Rangpo (Sikkim), it is expected that Sikkim would be linked by December 2022. The Centre is putting stress to execute the project fast,” said S. Chanda, NFR’s chief PRO. 
From Sevoke, it will be a 45km route to Rangpo, tracks will cover 13 bridges and 14 tunnels, with stations in Rangpo, Ryang, Teestabazar and Melli. 
The plan to make tunnels and set up tracks in five years did not happen because of forestland acquisition, quakes and landslides, said sources. 
An official said that over the past few months, work suffered again because of labour shortage amid Covid-19. 
The need for rail connectivity to Sikkim on the Indo-Sino border has been pointed out time and again by defence analysts, particularly after the Dokalam stand-off and the recent confrontation in Ladakh.
Even today, NH10 is the only road that connects the state with rest of the country.
The project costs Rs 1,339 crore. In the current fiscal, Rs 607 crore has been sanctioned.",states

572 new Covid-19 cases in Bengal," Bengal set a new record in intra-day Covid-19 cases with 572 people being infected in 24 hours till 9am on Sunday.
The figure surpassed the previous highest count of 542 reported on Friday. The state logged 1,635 new coronavirus cases in the past three days, which undid some of the progress made after June 13.
But the recovery rate stayed at 64.76 per cent, still much higher than the national rate of 58.64. Total number of active patients stood at 5,451, while the total cases crossed the 17,000 mark to touch 17,283.
In the past two weeks, Bengal saw 6,196 new cases, but there were 6,133 recoveries also.
“In these two weeks, despite the slight setback of the past three days, there were 55 per cent of total recoveries. The recovery rate has risen by roughly 20 per cent in the same period,” said a Bengal minister.
The state’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 10 to touch 639 on Sunday. Of the 639 deaths, Calcutta alone accounted for 366.
The state government reported 480 deaths — 75.12 per cent of the toll — as those with comorbidity “present”.
Of the 572 new cases, over 98 per cent were reported from districts which experienced a high volume of returns of migrant workers and others stranded elsewhere in the country during the initial stages of the lockdown. Calcutta alone reported 171 cases.
With 404 people getting cured of the infection in 24 hours, the total recoveries went past the 11,000 mark to touch 11,193.
“Of the 17,283 total Covid-19 cases, 11,193 have already recovered. That is a major positive,” said the minister.
A month ago, the state had 1,775 total recoveries and a recovery rate of 36.87.
Owing to the considerable rise in new cases, the positive confirmation rate — the percentage of people found infected among those tested — deteriorated from 2.6 to 3.69 per cent in a month.
While Bengal’s overall mortality rate stood at 3.69 per cent, that of Calcutta was 6.56.
The national rate now is 3.01 per cent.
Over 5.64 lakh people have successfully completed quarantine and they include around 2.38 lakh Shramik Special returnees. Barely 1.08 lakh people remain in quarantine now and are expected to complete the process in another week.
The state reported 10,563 tests in 24 hours, taking the total test count to 4,68,906, with 5,210 tests per million. A month ago, there had been a total of 1.85 lakh tests, with 2,056 tests per million.
Of 10,474 Covid-19 beds at 78 dedicated hospitals in Bengal, 22.05 per cent are occupied.
Besides, 6.58 per cent of 6,908 beds at 106 safe homes were also occupied as of Sunday.",states
CNI resumes communion service," The Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) resumed communion service at St Paul’s Cathedral on Sunday. Communion services had been suspended at all CNI churches under the diocese since March as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus.

Reverend Paritosh Canning, the bishop of Calcutta, attended the service held at 8.30am. Prayers and meditation with up to 25 people began at six other CNI churches in Calcutta and Howrah on Sunday.",states
Police night drive books 700," The city police prosecuted 701 people on Saturday night for multiple offences such as disorderly conduct and violation of traffic rules and night-time lockdown restrictions, officers said.
The prosecutions were part of a “special night drive” conducted jointly by the traffic police and officers of police stations.
“Such drives are conducted in pockets of the city every night, but this was the first drive held on such a big scale since the lockdown curbs were relaxed,” an officer said.
The drive was conducted between 10pm and 11pm on Saturday at major intersections.
Last Friday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that the lockdown restrictions would be in force from 10pm to 5am, instead of from 9pm to 5am.
On Saturday night, officers of all 25 traffic guards prosecuted 378 motorists and officers of police stations in the nine divisions prosecuted 323 people for violating lockdown restrictions.
“A large number of motorists were prosecuted for speeding, riding without a helmet and riding with more than one pillion rider,” an officer of the traffic department said.
“Those who were prosecuted by officers of police stations failed to give any satisfactory reply when asked why they were out post-10pm,” an officer said. “Only people associated with essential services and those who can cite an emergency are allowed to be out on the roads at night.”
A senior officer said such drives will be conducted periodically for effective implementation of the night curfew.",states
Decision for cycling bays in Calcutta," Several roads of Calcutta will have bays earmarked for cyclists, the state government has decided.
The urban development department has engaged a Faridabad-based consulting firm to conduct a preliminary survey of some thoroughfares of Calcutta where a bay can be created for cyclists. The agency will measure the arteries’ width and their traffic load and pattern throughout the day before drawing up a blueprint of how the bays can be created.
“The agency will start working on July 1 and draw up a preliminary blueprint by 15th. Officials of the transport department, Calcutta police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will then meet to discuss the blueprint,” said an official of the CMDA.
Urban development minister Firhad Hakim met officials of the CMDA and representatives of the consulting agency on Saturday to discuss the nitty-gritty of the project, aimed at promoting environment-friendly mode of transportation in Calcutta.
Urban development department officials said the agency had been tasked with two things. First, it will draw up a detailed plan on how to create cycling bays and how many thoroughfares are suitable for the creation of such bays. And then, it will suggest how to encourage more and more people to cycle to work and help reduce the city’s carbon footprint.
“Once the policy is drawn up, the urban development department will place it before the cabinet to issue an ordinance,” an official said.
Commuters are facing a tough time in Unlock 1 as only a handful of private buses are on the roads. Officials said that after hearing about the commuters’ plight, chief minister Mamata Banerjee felt the need to create space for cyclists across Calcutta.
On June 9, Mamata had said the government had approved a policy of allowing bicyclists on all small and medium roads in Calcutta and other major urban areas in an attempt to ease the inconvenience faced by commuters in reaching office in the absence of Metro and local trains.
She had also instructed Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma to issue a notification mentioning the roads on which bicyclists would be allowed. Lalbazar has since allowed cyclists only on certain lanes and bylanes.
“Once the transport department, CMC and the Calcutta police have cleared the blueprint, the consulting firm will come up with a full report within four months on creation of cycling bays in Calcutta,” the CMDA official said. “Based on this, a final detailed project report will be drawn up.”
Calcutta has witnessed a rise in the number of cyclists since Unlock-1 started on June 1 with many commuters pedalling down several kilometres to reach offices in the central business district and parts of south Calcutta. Once dedicated bays are created along certain roads, CMAD officials said, the number of cyclists will go up further.",states
"Mom, son face neighbours’ ire over Covid-19"," A woman who has tested positive for Covid-19, along with three others in the family, allegedly faced hostile behaviour from neighbours who did not want her and her eight-year-old son to stay in home isolation.
Five other families of the building in Behala where the woman lives allegedly asked her and her son, who were allowed by the health department to stay in home isolation, to get admitted to a hospital. The woman’s husband and her mother-in-law are admitted to a private hospital in Jadavpur.
Residents of the building, who relented after police intervened, also allegedly threatened to stop water supply to the woman’s flat. None of them is said to have agreed to be the family’s caregiver, a mandatory requirement if a person infected by the coronavirus wants to stay in home isolation.
A man from the locality finally came forward to be the caregiver and is providing the woman and her son with medicines and other essentials. Members of a neighbourhood club called on the woman and asked her to get in touch with them if she needed any help.
The woman’s husband, who works for a private blood bank, had gone to the Sundarbans several times recently to distribute relief to victims of Cyclone Amphan. He had fever and he tested positive for Covid-19 on June 23. The next day, his 77-year-old mother, wife and son tested positive, too.
“My husband had to be admitted to hospital because he was running a high temperature. My mother-in-law was admitted because of her age,” the woman said on Sunday.
Health department officials visited their house and said the woman and her son could stay in home isolation because they were asymptomatic.
“Other residents of the building told us that we could not stay at home and should get admitted to a hospital. Some said they might lose their jobs if their employers came to know that they shared an apartment block with two persons infected by the coronavirus. A few even threatened to stop water supply to our flat,” the woman told Metro over the phone.
The family then contacted the police.
A team from Behala police station reached the building and talked to the other families there. The residents finally agreed to let the woman and her child stay in their apartment.
“There is fear in many people’s minds about Covid-19. We had to explain what home isolation is to the residents and they finally agreed to let the woman and her son stay,” said Mohammed Irshad, a sub-inspector of Behala police station who visited the building.
“I requested members of all five families we share the building with to sign a form and agree to be our caregiver. But none was willing,” the woman said. Finally, she contacted a man who stays nearby and he agreed to be the caregiver.
“The family was our neighbour 10 years ago. When the woman told me she needed someone who could deliver essentials at her doorstep, I readily agreed,” said Subhasish Guha, who works for a private firm. “My wife and daughter supported my decision. I am taking all precautions.”
Tarun Kayal, the secretary of the club that has assured the woman of help, said: ”Initially, some members were reluctant to visit their home but we told them we would not be infected if we maintained social distancing and took other precautions. We asked the woman to call us if she needed any help.”",states
"Suicide after severe pain, dad too dies of shock"," A 60-year-old man was found hanging at his home early on Sunday, hours after doctors at a government hospital, where he went with severe leg pain, allegedly told him to go to another hospital as no orthopaedic was available.
The man’s 90-year-old father became unconscious on seeing his son hanging and was declared dead later in the day.
Police said Gopal Mandal, 60, was found hanging from the ceiling of a room at his Darapara home in Haridevpur.
Gopal’s wife Jhuma said her husband — a rickshaw van-puller by profession — had suffered fracture in a leg many years ago. A metal plate had to be inserted to repair the fracture and it was not taken out.
“My husband was suffering from an excruciating pain in that leg. On Saturday, we took him to a government hospital, where he was given an injection and then asked to wait. After an hour, we were told that the doctor in the orthopaedic department would not come and we should go elsewhere. We decided to return home because we could not afford to get him treated at a private hospital and there was also the fear of coronavirus infection,” Jhuma said.
Early on Sunday, Gopal’s pain intensified and he was last seen going to the washroom. When he failed to return to his room after some time, family members went to look for him and found him hanging in a store room.
Jhuma said her father-in-law Bhootnath Mandal passed out on seeing his son in that condition. When he was taken to hospital, he was declared dead.
Police said they had not received any complaint of medical negligence from Gopal’s family.
Gopal, who was the only earning member of the family, had left behind two children.",states
Traffickers eye recharge stores for numbers," Mobile recharge stores in Canning have been seeing a surge in visitors during the lockdown but not everyone is coming to recharge their phones.
Many men are trying to get access to the log book where the store owner lists the phone numbers of the customers — many minor girls among them. An innocuous missed call or a random friendship message is often the starting point of an operation that lands minor girls in outstation brothels, said police and rights activists.
The suspension of trains has temporarily restricted inter-state trafficking but traffickers are still active, especially in South and North 24-Parganas.
“Almost every girl has a phone. The traffickers are trying to tap as many contacts as they can while waiting for the train service to resume. The lockdown has made traffickers pro-active in looking for more and more contacts,” said Amina Laskar, a member of Bansra Birangana Seba Samiti, a South 24-Parganas-based organisation that works with schoolgirls to spread anti-trafficking awareness and also works for counselling and rehabilitation of trafficking survivors.
According to the police, several girls rescued from brothels said they had come in contact with traffickers by responding to missed calls or messages.
In many cases, the caller befriends the girl before calling her on a “date”. The area is usually near a railway station. A spiked drink or food is offered to the unsuspecting teenager. When she opens her eyes, she finds herself either on a long-distance train or another city.
“Many homes do not have a TV, but a phone is much cheaper. Increased internet penetration is also being used by traffickers. A random call or message is the most common ploy. Facebook and WhatsApp are also being used to lure girls,” said Munmun Chowdhury, the officer-in-charge of the women's police station in Canning, a hotbed of trafficking.
Two minor girls from North 24-Paragans’ Basirhat were rescued from a house in Gujarat a couple of days ago, the district police said. They were befriended by two youths and trafficked to Gujarat just before the lockdown.
“Often, the offer of a decent job does the trick for traffickers,” said Sambhu Nanda, who works with Partners in Anti-Trafficking, an alliance of NGOs in North 24-Parganas.
“Some men are giving a bundle of notes to a girl’s family in the garb of help. At the opportune moment, the giver will ask for a return of the cash. If the girl’s father cannot, he will ask for the girl’s hand,” said Pompi Banerjee, a social worker with Sanjog.
“The traffickers are doing their homework now. The test will start once the trains start running.”",states
How some Calcutta schools are cutting costs," A number of city schools are trying to cut costs to remain financially viable at a time when they are not getting fees and finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds for additional expenditure.
Reducing the number of buses, discontinuing digital classrooms and putting on hold plans to update the IT infrastructure are among the measures schools are taking to curb expenses.
Sri Sri Academy, for instance, has decided to reduce its bus fleet by half. Chowringhee High School has discontinued its digital classroom contract, as part of which it has to pay an agency every quarter.
Sushila Birla Girls’ School has suspended its IT-related upgrade this year, marking a break with the annual practice of replacing or upgrading some of its computers.
A school in Salt Lake has not renewed its contract with the nurses, who take care of the children when needed.
“We had written to the parents asking them who would want to avail themselves of the bus service when the school reopens. Only 25 per cent of the parents responded. We have decided to discontinue routes where parents have not responded because the school cannot maintain the expenses of the buses not knowing whether parents would still be interested in the service,” said Suvina Shunglu, the principal of Sri Sri Academy.
Schools are not sure about when children will be back on the campus for regular classes and hence do not want to keep making investments that are not needed now.
“The digital classroom is an important teaching aid for all classes from Class I to XII but we had to take steps to cut costs. Only five per cent of our parents have paid the fees so far,” said Perminder Dasani, the administrator of Chowringhee High School.
Many schools have not been receiving fees from parents. In some cases the fees received are dismal, leaving the authorities struggling to run the institutions.
Some of the institutions that have not yet decided to curtail costs said they, too, might do so.
“We will have to cut down on the non-recurring costs that can be kept on hold till classes in the school resume,” said G.V. Subramanian, the secretary and director of Bhavan’s Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir.
Schools said some of the costs would anyway get reduced because sports or concerts are unlikely to be held this year. A large amount of money is spent on hiring a stadium or an auditorium for sports or a concert.
Despite that schools are taking steps to ensure there is no “extra burden” on them.
“We have to upgrade our IT-related infrastructure to keep the system current. In fact, we usually have to change a set of computers in the labs that do not function properly, but all of that has been put on hold. We also had plans to upgrade the tablets that we give to our children in the classroom. That has been put on hold, too,” said Sharmila Bose, the principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School.
Several schools that would keep adding services or products have put most investments on hold.
Throughout the year, and especially towards the beginning of the session, vendors approach schools for various kinds of products such as e-books and other digital products, and assessment tools.
“This time, too, there are proposals for new services or products. We would have considered them in normal circumstances, but this year we do not want to add to the financial burden on the school,” said Amita Prasad, the director of Indus Valley World School.",states
Jharkhand ‘fake’ job fair alert," The Jharkhand government has warned people against a fake letter that says the state would organise a job mela.
The information and public relations department (IPRD) on Saturday night said in a notice: “Department of higher, technical education and skill development has informed that it is not conducting any placement drive at present.”
The fake letter, issued in the name of the department, has been widely circulated on social media.
The IPRD also posted the letter in its WhatsApp groups with “FAKE” stamped in red on it and cautioned people not to fall into the trap.
Under the heading ‘Placement Drive 2020’, the letter said that the higher, technical education and skill development department would organise a job mela at the Science and Technology Campus at Namkom in Ranchi on July 1 and 2.
It asked those who did their BTech or diploma in civil, electrical and mechanical streams and also certain others to get registered for posts of junior engineers so that they could come to the job fair for recruitment by a host of well-known companies.
The fake letter had named General Motors, Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel, Tata Power, Tata Technology, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, Jio, Apollo Tyres and HCL among prospective recruiters.
It had also mentioned that the annual salary would vary between Rs 1.44 lakh and Rs 6.50 lakh, depending on the posts.
The interested candidates were asked to register themselves on a link that appeared to be similar to the one used by students seeking admission in state-run universities.
“You never know the fraudsters may have done something to dupe interested candidates through that site,” said an official who did not wish to be named.
The way the letter had been drafted raised suspicion.
It asked the candidates “who have passed in 2018, 2019 & 2020 appearing students” to get registered.
The letter also mentioned certain “safety precaution must” that included “Once’s exit should not be able to get entry” and “wearing formal dress coat candidate will be allowed entry”.
A WhatsApp group of the Press Information Bureau (PIB), Ranchi, also posted the letter, saying the Jharkhand state fact-check unit had fount it to be “fake” and adding it was “circulated by some cheating organisations”.",states
"Lightning, downpour alert in Jharkhand over three days"," Several parts of Jharkhand are expected to experience lightning strikes during the next three days, warned weathermen on Sunday.
IMD’s Ranchi Meteorological Centre also issued an alert of heavy rain in isolated pockets of the state, especially in the northern districts, during the next 24 hours.
“Heavy rain is expected tomorrow in the districts near the Bihar border. Lightning and thunderstorm alert was also issued in isolated pockets of the state during the next 72 hours,” the director of the Ranchi Met Centre, S.D. Kotal, told The Telegraph Online.
The Met centre on Sunday issued a series of nowcasts (short-term forecasts) of thunderstorm and rain in Ranchi and several other places.
Statistics revealed that the southwest monsoon activity was weak over Jharkhand during the past 24 hours.
Light to moderate rain occurred at a few places over the state.
The highest amount of rainfall was recorded at Ranchi (20.6mm).
The highest maximum temperature of 34.8 degrees Celsius was recorded at Jamshedpur, Chaibasa and Dumka while the lowest minimum temperature was 23.2degrees Celsius at Ranchi.
The western part of the monsoon trough at mean sea level was on Sunday passing through Amritsar, Ambala, Meerut, Gorakhpur and its eastern part lies close to the foothills of the Himalayas. A trough from northeast Madhya Pradesh to north Madhya Maharashtra extended upto 3.1km above mean sea level.
Sunday’s data revealed that so far in June, the first monsoon month, Jharhand has received 190.7mm rainfall against an actual of 178.6mm, a surplus of seven per cent.
Lightning strikes killed 83 persons, including 26 children, in various districts of n Bihar on June 25. It was the worst such single-day toll in recent years.
IMD officials said districts like Palamau, Garhwa, Chatra, Simdega, Hazaribagh and Koderma are vulnerable to lightning strikes.
In May, four children between nine to 12 years fell victim to lightning strikes in Palamu, Garhwa and Chatra districts.",states
Damodar Valley Corporation warns of long power cuts after non-payment of dues," The local residents and traders of Dhanbad, already grappling with a slump in trade during the Covid-19 lockdown, are fearing an adverse impact on their business with the Damodar Valley Corporation warning the Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd of 18-hour power cuts from July 1, as a result of non-payment of dues.
The president of the Purana Bazar Chamber of Commerce, Md Sohrab, told The Telegraph Online on Sunday, “The state government should take the warning of 18-hour power cuts seriously and sort out the issue with the Corporation.”
“Why should the common people face difficulties, as they have been paying their bills regularly?” asked Sohrab.
He added that such a decision, amid the Covid pandemic, was beyond any logic.
Ramkrishna Singh, the general secretary of the Jharkhand Rajya Bijli Kamagar Union, said, “The pending dues are an issue between the power corporation and JBVNL. The common people who pay their bills regularly should not be allowed to suffer.”
“The Corporation should also show restraint in serving such notices to the people of Jharkhand, where many of its power plants, including Chandrapura Thermal Power Plant and Bokaro Thermal power plants, are situated,” said Singh.
The general manager of the Dhanbad supply area of JBVNL, Pratosh Kumar, said, “The issues of pending dues and power cuts by DVC are being discussed at the headquarters level and we are expecting some solution soon.”
“We are also drawing extra power amounting to around 70MW through the Dumka grid after the establishment of the 250MW capacity electric power grid at Kandr. So the residents of the town will not have any problem even during reduced power supply by DVC,” he added.
JBVNL at present draws around 212MW from from six feeders of the Damodar ValleyCorporation, including Putki feeder for Dhanbad town and Katras, Patherdih feeder for Jharia and surrounding areas, Bhetia feeder for sub-urban areas of Dhanbad town, Kumardubi feeder for Kumbardhubi and surrounding areas like Chirkunda and Maithon feeder for Nirsa, Mugma and surrounding areas.
However, due to faults in the feeder substation and resultant power failure, the JBVNL had to face the wrath of its consumers.
The establishment of the electric grid substation has decreased the dependency of the JBVNL on the Corporation quite a bit.",states
Dowry harassment FIR against former DGP-turned BJP leader," Former Jharkhand Director General of Police-turned BJP leader D.K. Pandey has been accused of mental harassment by his daughter-in-law in an FIR lodged with the women’s police station here, police said on Sunday.
In the FIR, a copy of which is with The Telegraph Online, Pandey’s daughter-in-law Rekha Mishra accused him and his family of mentally harassing her for dowry and hiding facts related to the sexual orientation of her husband, Subhankan Pandey.
“We have lodged a named FIR against D.K. Pandey and his family with our police station under section 498A of the IPC. Her primary accusation is mental harassment for dowry,” said officer in-charge of Mahila police station in Ranchi, Monalisa Kerketta. “It would not be fair to comment on the case before a thorough investigation is done,” she added.
This is not the first instance when Pandey has found himself in the eye of the storm. He was appointed DGP of Jharkhand on February 24, 2015 and retired on May 30, 2019. In March, 2019, Pandey joined the BJP at a grand event in Ranchi.
Pandey also headed the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) between 2010 and 2012. The fake Maoist surrender scam occurred during this period and Pandey found himself in the crosshairs of human rights activists, media reports have said.
Ranchi SP Saurav (he goes by one name) said that police have initiated an investigation in the matter. “We have received a complaint, and a probe has been initiated,” he said.
Pandey could not be contacted for a comment on Sunday. The FIR, police said, carried names of Pandey, his son Subhankan and wife Poonam Pandey.
Sources said that Rekha and Subhankan tied the nuptial knot around three years ago. Rekha, who happens to be the daughter of a BJP leader, has been staying away from her in-laws for more than a year, sources said. ",states
Meghalaya Congress seeks answers from Modi," The Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) has sought answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on China's transgressions along the border and wanted to know why he accepted Chinese money into the PM CARES Fund.
“A delusional Modi government continues to sidestep the brazen Chinese transgressions and occupation of our territory by the Chinese forces in Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso Lake area, Hot Springs and Depsang Plainsupto Y-Junction,” PCC working president James Lyngdoh said in a statement here on Sunday.
He alleged that Modi “unashamedly misleads” the nation and serves the sinister agenda of the Chinese by claiming that China had never intruded into Indian territory, nor is it in occupation of any territory. This is the greatest disservice to the nation, he added.
Lyngdoh pointed out that Chinese hostilities in recent years are well-known — be it the occupation of the Depsang Plains up to Y-Junction in 2013 (from where they were pushed back by Indian forces under the Congress/UPA government after a face-off), be it the Chinese occupation of our territory at Point 30R Post in Chumar, Ladakh, in 2014 (when Modi was playing Jhula diplomacy with the Chinese President in Ahmedabad), or be it the Chinese occupation of the Doklam plateau in 2017.
“But every time the Modi government is questioned on the Chinese transgressions of our territory, in four different places, i.e. Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso Lake Area, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains, a deceptive Modi government and a paranoid BJP resorts to diversionary tactics and disinformation,” the PCC working president added.
He said the Congress would keep asking these questions in “national interest”.
Stating that the Prime Minister has a soft spot for China, Lyngdoh noted that Modi is the only Indian Prime Minister who has visited China five times.
Moreover, he said that what was most worrying and alarming for national security was the fact that donations were received by Modi from Chinese companies in his PM CARES Fund.
“No one knows the constitution or the operational framework of the PM CARES Fund. No one knows how it is controlled or money given to it utilized. The Fund is not even subjected to audit by any public authority including CAG. The Prime Minister’s Office has gone to the extent of saying that this Fund is not a public authority. PM CARES Fund is not even subjected to RTI. All in all, the Fund appears to be solely run by the Prime Minister in an opaque and secret fashion with zero transparency and zero accountability,” Lyngdoh added.
He pointed out that as per reports, the fund has received Rs 9,678 crore as on May 20.
“The shocking part is that though Chinese forces have transgressed into our territory, Prime Minister has received money in the Fund from Chinese companies,” he alleged.
Lyngdoh wanted to know why Modi had received Chinese money into the fund despite the overt Chinese hostilities in 2013.
“Has the Prime Minister received Rs 7 crore from the controversial company HUAWEI? Does HUAWEI have a direct connection with People’s Liberation Army, China? Has the Chinese-owned TikTok facilitated a donation of Rs 30 crore to the controversial PM CARES Fund?” Lyngdoh asked.
He also asked whether Paytm, which has a 38 per cent Chinese ownership, had given Rs 100 crore to the controversial fund and whether another Chinese company, Xiaomi, committed Rs 15 crore.
Further, Lyngdoh wanted to know whether it was a fact that Chinese company Oppo donated Rs 1 crore to the fund.
“If Prime Minister of India will compromise his position by accepting donations of hundreds of crores from Chinese companies in the controversial and opaque Fund, how will he defend the country against the Chinese aggression? Prime Minister Modi needs to answer,” he added.",states
Conrad tests negative for second time," Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K. Sangma tested negative for Covid-19 on Sunday for the second time.
In a communiqué, the chief minister’s office stated that Conrad has been under home quarantine for the past four days after his return from Manipur and Delhi.
The first test was conducted on June 22 while the second test was done on Sunday, the communiqué stated.
As a precautionary measure, the chief minister will be under home quarantine for a few more days.
The team of officials and police, who had accompanied the chief minister to Guwahati, also tested negative for the virus and are under home quarantine.
However, Conrad said two more positive cases were detected on Sunday in Meghalaya. The two belong to one of the central armed police forces.
With these new positive cases, Meghalaya currently has seven active cases. While 42 patients have been cured, one patient had passed away on April 15.
The political developments in Manipur had forced Conrad to travel to Imphal and New Delhi after four disgruntled National People’s Party (NPP) legislators pulled out from the N. Biren Singh government.
To diffuse the situation, Conrad, who is also the national president of the NPP, along with Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, intervened and took the four legislators to Delhi to meet BJP president J.P. Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah.
The four legislators, who were also ministers in the Biren Singh government, withdrew their resignation letters along with their decision to withdraw support.",states
BJP hurdle to all-party consensus on relief," Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s plans to engineer a political consensus to demand Rs 10,000 for every migrant worker and a national disaster status for Amphan has run into a hurdle, as the state unit of the BJP has disagreed to the resolution.
Earlier this week, Mamata had set up the all-party committee to look into the problems of migrant workers and the post-Amphan condition in the state and draw up a resolution to be sent to the Centre.
State BJP president Dilip Ghosh, a member of the committee, disagreed with the “language and figures” mentioned in the resolution and refused to back it.
“If the Centre is being asked for help, the state government can’t dictate terms,” Ghosh told The Telegraph.
BJP leaders claimed that the all-party committee’s demand for national calamity status for Amphan is “absurd” as there is no legislative provision to call any natural calamity a national disaster.
Amphan which claimed 118 lives, has been touted as one of the worst cyclones that hit Bengal in decades.
Ghosh, a member of the committee, is also against the demand that the Centre should offer Rs 10,000 to each migrant labourer who returned home in Bengal. “The Centre should find out the number of affected migrant workers on the basis of an independent survey and then decide on the the cash aid,” Ghosh said.
The BJP also demanded inclusion of a few lines in the draft expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “proactive role in assisting Bengal with a financial aid of Rs 1,000 crore after Amphan”.
The other parties in the committee are not interested in including this bit.
Trinamul sources said that education minister Partha Chatterjee tried his best to convince Ghosh to back the proposal that other parties agreed to, but could not.",states
New forest beat offices for Bengal," The Bengal forest department has decided to set up 176 beat offices across the state to augment vigilance in forest beats — the lowest tier of the department.
“We are taking every possible step to protect the forests and wildlife. So far, there were no offices of forest beats and the beat officers had to work from their quarters. That is why it has been decided to set up beat offices across the state. Among these, 37 offices will function in the Buxa Tiger Reserve area. On Saturday, we have launched 12 beat offices in the BTR,” said Rajib Banerjee, the state forest minister, after inaugurating a beat office in the Garam beat of the reserve area.
Speaking to newspersons, Banerjee said that he would hold a meeting with officials of his department in Calcutta next Monday to decide on the proposal of reopening all the zoological parks in the state.
In Bengal, there are 12 such zoological parks. All these parks have been closed for public from March 15 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Stricter rules to rein in Covid-19," The administrations of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Malda districts have decided to draw up new regulations to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In and around Siliguri, where over 250 Covid-19 cases and 14 deaths have been reported so far, the administration has decided to enforce complete lockdown in three wards — 18, 28 and 46.
“The administration has been asked to ensure that nothing other than medicine shops remain open in these markets,” said state tourism minister Gautam Deb.
Added to this, the Darjeeling district administration has identified 16 nursing homes and instructed the authorities to reserve 10 per cent of their beds for Covid-19 patients.
Two existing Covid hospitals of the city have 145 beds and those associated with healthcare fear that the beds would be full soon, if the current trend of the pandemic persists in the city. For asymptomatic patients, two centres have been opened in Batasi and Hatighisa.
In Malda, 47 persons have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the number to 543. Hence, market timings will be planned afresh.",states
Heavyweights under glare," The Trinamul Congress disciplinary committee has served showcause notices to 63 party members, including two heavyweights from Bankura and Durgapur, on Friday on charges of alleged corruption in delivering relief materials to people during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Durgapur mayor-in-council member and trade union leader Prabhat Chatterjee and former textile minister Shyamaprasad Mukherjee are the two Trinamul heavyweights on whom the party has cracked its whip.
Chatterjee, along with four other leaders of the party in West Burdwan, including Asansol deputy mayor Tabasum Ara have been asked to submit written explanations within 48 hours.
“The four party leaders were served showcause notices following instruction of our state-level disciplinary committee,” Jitendra Tiwari, Asansol’s mayor and Trinamul’s West Burdwan district president said on Saturday.
Chatterjee allegedly collected Rs 20 lakh from some contractors of Durgapur Steel Plant but submitted the money in the name of his trade union.

Trinamul’s face in Bankura Shyamaprasad Mukherjee has been accused of not distributing relief materials he received from the party.
Mukherjee, however, said he was yet to receive any showcause letter.
“I will reply to the show-cause once I get it,” he said.
Mukherjee is one of the three leaders from Bankura who have been showcaused.
Three leaders from East Burdwan and two from Purulia are also accused of misappropriating relief materials for victims of Covid-19.
The top brass in Bengal’s ruling party has taken up a “cleansing drive” after a number of complaints against its party members on corruption reached them.
Sources said the party would not tolerate the misappropriation of several beneficial schemes of the Mamata Banerjee government ahead of the Assembly polls due next year.
The party has expelled a gram panchayat chief in Hooghly last week on charges of corruption and nepotism over relief distribution to victims of Cyclone Amphan.
“Our leader Mamata Banerjee has made it clear on several occasions that she has zero tolerance against corruption and negligence in delivering beneficial schemes among the people,” Asansol mayor Tiwari said.",states
Landslides in north Sikkim near border," Nonstop monsoon rain on Saturday led to fresh landslides in many places of Sikkim while swelling rivers led to flooding in some tea plantations in north Bengal.
The worst hit is north Sikkim, the district that shares borders with China.
As of Saturday, there is no report of any loss of life, and the sensitive border district is connected with the rest of the state through NH310A that connects Gangtok with Mangan, district headquarters of north Sikkim.

Police said the 45-year-old mason hardly had work since late March. Cyclone Amphan on May 20 damaged his mud-and-asbestos home.
No government help came their way to repair the house. The mason also tried to get a concrete house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana but did not succeed, the police officer added, quoting the man.
Speaking to The Telegraph on Saturday, the girl’s parents confessed they would not have normally taken the decision to marry off their daughter at the tender age of 15. “But with the lockdown, we wanted to shield her from our poverty,” the father added.
He added that they had enough food to eat owing to government rations supplies, but his own income was down by a third since March. “The boy (the groom) worked in a private firm in Calcutta. Hecomes from a good family,” he said. “We did not object.”
The girl’s mother added: “The boy even said he would let our daughter continue her studies. The family did not ask for dowry either. We barely had the money for her Madhyamik examination, much less her higher secondary studies.” She added had fixed a “public” wedding for their daughter on June 30, nothing “underhand”.
But a neighbour contradicted the mother’s claim, saying no one in the locality had been told, much less invited.
A police officer said they received a letter from the girl saying she was being married off against her will.
The girl said she was “under pressure” from her parents to get married. “They did not care about my education,” she said. “I had no option but to write to the police.”
Sociologist Surajit C. Mukhopadhyay saw in the incident of child marriage a “prevalent social template in which a girl child is seen as a burden”. He acknowledged the economic impact of lockdown had increased the penury of the disadvantaged.
Sources earlier this month reported a nearly 30 per cent hike in child marriages across Bengal during lockdown, attributing it to domestic tensions and financial crisis. This month, the state juvenile justice committee received a letter from Calcutta High Court asking for official numbers.
“In East Midnapore, we saw 19 child marriages during the lockdown. We stopped at least 50,” said district child welfare officer Purnendu Pouranik. “The count is in sharp contrast to three child marriages reported between January and March.”",states
Man held for kidnap of nephew," A 10-year-old boy was abducted from outside his Tiljala home on Friday afternoon after which his family got ransom calls for Rs10 lakh.
He was rescued from a guesthouse in Behala’s Parnasree, some 10km from his home, on Saturday morning.
Police arrested his maternal uncle, who apparently confessed to plotting his nephew’s kidnap, and two others, Ranjit Kumar and Vishwajeet Kumar, that he allegedly hired for the abduction.
A Tiljala police station officer said they started the probe by examining call details of numbers from where ransom demands were made. “We found one number which was frequently contacted before and after the abduction. It belonged to the uncle,” he said.
“The time just before and after the commission of the crime is very important. We found that the kidnappers were dialling a particular number during this period. This number belonged to the child’s own maternal uncle,” said an officer of the Tiljala police station.

The police zeroed in on the maternal uncle who purportedly admitted to plotting the kidnap of his nephew.
Based on his statement, the police raided a guesthouse named Vidyasagar in Parnasree and found the child in the presence of the two men who had allegedly carried out the abduction.
Preliminary investigations by the police suggest that the two had been hired by the uncle. All three have been booked for abduction for ransom and criminal conspiracy. They will be produced before the court on Sunday.
The child has been handed over to his mother.",states
500-plus cases for second day in Bengal," Bengal on Saturday reported 521 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of infections to 16,711 so far, but the state’s recovery rate of 64.56 per cent is still far ahead of the national rate of 58.41.
Although Friday and Saturday with 1,063 new cases were a bit of a damper for Bengal after signs of a major turnaround after June 13, the state managed to keep its active cases at 5,293 as of Saturday, 400 less than two weeks ago.
In these two weeks, there were 6,013 new cases, outweighed by 6,247 recoveries.
Of the 521 new cases, around 97 per cent were reported from districts with a high volume of returnees. Calcutta alone reported 141.
The state’s Covid-19 toll also rose by 13 to touch 629. Of them, Calcutta alone accounted for 359 deaths.
Of the total deaths, the state government reported 470 or 74.72 per cent as deaths with comorbidity “present”. In two weeks, there were 166 Covid-19 deaths, but 152 of those had comorbidity “present”.
Bengal’s overall mortality rate stood at 3.76 per cent, that of Calcutta 6.64. The national mortality rate is 3.05 per cent.
“In two weeks, the mortality rate has gone down from 4.32 to 3.76 for Bengal, and from 8.16 to 6.64 for Calcutta. Lowering the mortality rate, getting it to a place better than the national rate is our foremost priority,” said a minister. A month ago, the state’s mortality rate was 6.5, while that of Calcutta 10.21.
The minister added: “In the past two weeks, the state had 36 per cent of the total cases and 58 per cent of the total recoveries (since the onset of the pandemic). The recovery rate rose by over 22 per cent. Despite the slight setback of last two days, we have had more good news than bad.”
Over 5.52 lakh people successfully completed quarantine, including around 2.34 lakh Shramik Special returnees. Barely 1.19 lakh people remain in quarantine now and are expected to complete the process in another week.
“Over 2.17 lakh people successfully completed quarantine in these two weeks, including over 1.17 lakh Shramik Special returnees,” said the minister.
The state reported 9,548 tests in 24 hours, taking the total test count to 4,58,343, with 5,093 tests per million.
“Even two weeks ago, we were at 3.25 lakh tests and 3,608 tests per million. We are all set to go past the 5 lakh tests landmark by (this coming) Wednesday or Thursday,” said the minister.
Owing to the considerable rise in new cases, positive confirmation rate or the percentage of people found infected among those tested deteriorated from 3.29 to 3.65 per cent in these two weeks.
Bengal reported occupancy of 21.83 per cent of the 10,472 Covid-19 beds in 78 dedicated hospitals, besides 6.76 per cent occupancy of the 6,908 beds of 106 safe homes.",states
Trinamul MLA’s home office burgled," Unidentified burglars entered the office on the ground floor of the residence of Trinamul MLA Tapas Kumar Saha in Nadia’s Tehatta and decamped with cash and valuables early on Saturday.
Probe revealed Saha, who represents the Palashipara Assembly seat in Nadia, had lost one of the duplicate keys to his office room on Friday, which the burglars apparently used.
The MLA’s home in Koruipara is around 12km from Tehatta police station.
Though the MLA said he couldn’t reveal the quantum of the loss, he told the media: “Ami sarbashanto hoye gechi (I have lost everything).”
Embarrassed district police authorities started a theft case against unidentified persons on the basis of the MLA’s complaint with Tehatta police.

The police detained two persons, including a woman domestic help, to interrogate them for their suspected role.
The burglars had deactivated at least two out of three CCTV cameras before the operation. The police have only got brief footage of one suspected burglar wearing a mask. “This camera also could not provide further detail as the burglar covered it around 2.30am,” a policeman said.
The theft came to the MLA’s notice when he was preparing for a morning walk.
“I found the door of my office room ajar. I entered and to my shock found the room ransacked with almirahs and safes open. Cash and valuable documents inside were missing,” Saha said. “The burglars got keys of the almirah from the drawer and put the keys back in the drawer, which indicates an inside job.”
“I kept everything, including cash and personal papers, in the office. I cannot quote an exact figure (of the loss),” the MLA added.
Bombs seized

NSCN(IM) counters governor’s ‘jibe’," The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (IM) on Saturday denied extorting money at any point of time but said it levied legitimate taxes on people in an apparent reaction to Nagaland governor R.N. Ravi’s recent letter on “armed gangs” to chief minister N. Rio.
“Taxes have been the source of sustenance that has brought the Naga political movement this far...legitimately acknowledged by earlier Interlocutors and Indian authorities..,” the NSCN (IM) said.
This comes two days after governor Ravi’s letter dated June 16 to Rio surfaced on social media. Without naming anyone, the letter spoke of law and order problems over extortion by armed gangs.
Ravi is also the Centre’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks that started in 1997.
Without naming Ravi, the NSCN(IM) said it was a legitimate national organisation of the Naga people “and not a gang”. The statement went on to say: “But if he finds pleasure to handle the Naga issue as a ‘law and order’ problem he is not the right person to solve the long-standing problem.”

Strategic link needs repairs," Part of NH27, the approach road and bridge — of strategic importance in view of the Galwan Valley face-off — is in such bad shape that it takes four hours or more to cross 4km.
The 4km stretch from Paharpur More on Jalpaiguri outskirts to Domohoni comprises the approach road and Teesta Bridge — currently the only road-bridge for heavy vehicles to move to the Northeast.
Of the 4km, the approach road is over 3km and the bridge a little less than 1km.
The strategic importance of this bridge has time and again been flagged by defence analysts and security agencies.
“As of now, Teesta Bridge is the only road bridge for security forces to carry artillery and other heavy equipment to the Northeast if needed. But the condition of NH27 and the bridge itself is so bad that normal vehicles get stranded for hours. The administration and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) should immediately repair the stretch,” said a retired army officer based in Jalpaiguri.

Heavy monsoon in north Bengal has worsened the situation as potholes and craters are waterlogged.
“From Friday evening to Saturday late afternoon, vehicles could barely move a kilometre in an hour,” said a senior police officer.
About 10 days back, Jalpaiguri district magistrate Abhishek Tiwary had asked the NHAI to repair the stretch within seven days.
However, no major repair work has been witnessed yet.
Contacted, NHAI project director Pradyut Dasgupta said they could not start the repairs due to the consistent downpour. “Once the rain stops, we will start repairs on an emergency basis,” he promised.
“ Also, work on the second bridge has almost finished and we need to finish its approach roads,” added Dasgupta.
A second bridge parallel to the existing bridge is under construction and would take at least another month before it is opened for traffic.
The bad road conditions have also left the drivers at inconvenience.
Sujit Kumar Sahu, a truck driver carrying medicines from Bihar to Assam, said: “I reached Paharpur More at 8am on Saturday. It took me five hours to reach Domohoni. It was backbreaking.”
Throughout Saturday, policemen had to bear the brunt of keeping vehicles in line and try their best to clear the congestion.",states
Plain-paper ease for Amphan pleas," The Bengal government has done away with printed application forms and allowed people to apply for compensation by giving their details on plain paper amid growing complaints of graft in Amphan relief.
“A simple plain paper application would be treated as a valid application for consideration...an organised application process on pre-printed form should not be encouraged,” reads the order issued by chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Friday.
Sources said this was one of the state government’s many steps to ensure no genuine victim of the May 20 cyclone is deprived of compensation following reports of anomalies and political bias from East Midnapore, North and South 24 Parganas and Howrah.
“The chief minister (Mamata Banerjee) received 2,100 such complaints. District authorities are receiving thousands of complaints against the ruling party-led gram panchayats, all alleging that genuine victims were denied compensation,” said an official.
For example, about 5,000 villagers of a gram panchayat in Patharpratima in South 24 Parganas had gheraoed the pradhan recently, alleging that names of only 600 people figured on the list of beneficiaries for government compensation when dwellings of more than 7,000 people were razed.

“Allegedly, even these 600 beneficiaries were close to the ruling party leaders and their homes suffered no major damage,” said a source.
Apparently, the state government is trying hard to undo the damage even as Opposition parties are leveraging people’s anger to penetrate Trinamul strongholds ahead of the Assembly election in 2021.
Sources said that the state government decided to accept plain paper applications in an attempt to uproot corruption at the grassroots.
A senior government official said it was observed that whenever villagers were asked to fill in printed forms for applications under government schemes, allegations of corruption cropped up. Either people with political backing take away all the forms, or villagers find their bureaucratic language hard to understand.
Chief secretary Sinha asked authorities to verify each application physically. He said that the list of beneficiaries should be rectified by the task force set up at block levels.
Sinha’s order stated the entire exercise should be completed by July 2 and a compliance report sent to Nabanna.
Sujan Chakraborty, CPM MLA from Jadavpur wrote a letter to the chief secretary pointing out that lists of beneficiaries were not put up at BDO offices so far despite the decision being taken at the all-party meeting held by the chief minister on Wednesday.
A source in Nabanna said lists of beneficiaries were already public in districts. Those who feel deprived can give applications on plain paper. The rectified list will be put up on July 2 at BDO offices.",states
Families get ‘less grain but made to pay more’," A social audit conducted by the Jharkhand State Food Commission has found that some beneficiaries received less foodgrains than they were entitled to and had to pay more than the prescribed rates during the first two phases of the lockdown.
The social audit team comprising 50 volunteers interviewed 4,428 families across 23 districts from April 27 to May 7 to assess the situation.
Ninety six per cent of the families interviewed had ration cards and 58 per cent without cards had applied for them, the audit team found.
Those with Antyodaya Anna Yojana cards were entitled to 35kg of food grains every month at Rs 1 per kilo. Ninety three percent of these card holders received two months’ ration while the rest got it only for a month during the period, the report said.
Twenty eight per cent of those who got ration for two months had to pay more than the prescribed rate while 48 per cent received less quantity, the report said.
Five per cent of those who got ration for a month had to pay more than the prescribed rate while 63 per cent got less quantity of grains, the report said.
Complaints about the quality of food grains were negligible as most of the people interviewed said they were either good or average.
The families interviewed included 1,373 belonging to Scheduled Tribes, 846 to Scheduled Castes and 18 to particularly vulnerable tribal groups.
Eighty per cent children in families eligible for midday meal also received food grains during the period while the rest in Godda, Giridih, Koderma and Jamtara districts were deprived, the report said.
Among those who received food grains, 60 per cent got the exact quantity while the rest were given less, the report said. However, only 49 per cent of the eligible children got the cash amount they were supposed to receive during the period, it added.
Only 80 per cent of the eligible children (aged between six months and three years) of families registered with anganwadi centres under the Integrated Child Development Scheme received food grains during the period, the report said. Around 66 per cent of the families who registered under the scheme during the period got food grains, it added.
“This was the first of three such concurrent social audit to be conducted,” said Haldhar Mahto, a member of the state food commission “We have lodged 393 complaints from 7,999 people about irregularities in distribution of food grains. A probe is on in these cases,” he said.",states
Flood hits 21 Assam districts," As many as 21 districts and a population of over 4.6 lakh have been affected in the ongoing flood in Assam with water entering Dibrugarh town and coming threateningly close to entering the capital city. Assam has 33 districts.
With the death of two more persons on Saturday, altogether 18 persons have died in the flood that hit the state on May 22, according to official sources.
Social media was abuzz with updates and comments on flood and the problems being faced by the affected. Such has been the situation that Oil India Limited had to call off all activities related to the capping of the gas well blowout at Baghjan, about 530km east of Guwahati, because the surrounding area was submerged by the flood water which has also hit the Kaziranga National Park.
According to the Central Water Commission, all major rivers are flowing over the danger level because of incessant rainfall over the past few days. The MET office has predicted heavy rain in the northeast till Tuesday.
The Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level at Neamatighat (Jorhat), Tezpur (Sonitpur), Guwahati (Kamrup), Goalpara (Goalpara), Dhubri (Dhubri); Burhiding at Chenimari (Dibrugarh); Dhansiri(S) at Numaligarh (Golaghat); Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing (Sonitpur); Puthimari NH Road Crossing (Kamrup); Manas at NH Road Crossing (Barpeta); Beki at Road Bridge (Barpeta)

The affected districts are Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Udalguri, Darrang, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh and Tinsukia.
Assam State Disaster Management Authority said that 19,496 affected people are living in 132 relief camps, the most in Tinsukia (53) Dibrugarh (41) followed by Dhemaji and Goalpara with eight each.
All the 22 wards of Dibrugarh are under water while all the major rivers flowing along and within Guwahati have registered a rising trend. With heavy rainfall over the past few days, the Kamrup (Metro) District have asked people living in landslide prone areas to move to safer places till the monsoon are over.
On Friday, a person died in a landslide in the Kahilipara area while a major highway was blocked because of landslip in the Amingaon area here. “The situation is bad. Covid cases are rising and now we are staring at flood,” an official said.
Total lockdown is being implemented for 14 days from Sunday midnight in Kamrup Metro district to check the spread of Covid-19 cases.

Mobile Covid-19 test lab in Jamshedpur," A Jamshedpur-based company has developed a Covid-19 mobile testing laboratory which it claims is the country’s first with fully automated sanitisation and thermal scanning facilities.
The mobile lab, developed by Bistupur-based Bharat Engineering and Body Building Company Private Limited, can provide test results within half-an-hour, said the company’s managing director, Navin Bhalotia.
“We built one such mobile testing lab this month and entered into an agreement with Ranchi-based Pragati Hospital and Research Centre for providing lab technicians (at least three in each vehicle) and attendants (at least two in each vehicle) along with drivers. The mobile lab can move in any terrain. It has facilities for testing through ICMR-validated TruNat machines along with IgM/IgG antibody tests. A test will cost Rs 1,250 and results would be available in half-an-hour. We have already applied to the Indian Council of Medical Research for certification,” he said.
Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had launched the country’s first mobile laboratory for Covid-19 testing on June 18, which was developed by a joint collaboration of the ministry of science and technology and Andhra Pradesh-based firm Med-Tech Zone. “The I-lab launched by the health minister had both RT-PCR and Elisa testing facility and could perform 25 RT-PCR tests in a day. However, our lab can perform more than 40 tests daily and give out results in less than 30 minutes.
“We have gone for Trunat rather than RT-PCR as results are delayed in the latter. One can get a confirmatory RT-PCR test done at a health centre. We have a contact-free automated thermal scanning and sanitisation system installed in the mobile lab, which is not present in the I-lab,” said Bhalotia.
The mobile lab, which measures 15ft by 6ft, costs Rs 55 lakh.
“We gave a demonstration to the Chhattisgarh government earlier this week and have got an order to build four such labs from chief minister Bhupesh Baghel. We also gave a demonstration before Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren and are expecting orders for the mobile lab,” said Bhalotia.
The company can manufacture 10 such mobile labs every month after a formal nod from ICMR.
The company has more than four decades of expertise in automobile body fabrication and modelling.",states
"Bikers in mask pose as cops, rob elderly women"," At least four elderly women were robbed of their gold ornaments in the past 48 hours and police believe two men on a motorcycle wearing masks and posing as cops were involved in the robberies.
The two have been posing as cops and telling women on roads “it is risky to wear gold jewellery during the lockdown” and asking them to take off the ornaments, the police said.
In each of the four cases, reported in Entally, Shyampukur, Lake Town and in the Airport area on Thursday and Friday, the men had stopped the women walking alone and introduced themselves as police officers. They had offered the women a white paper and asked them to take off their ornaments and kept the package in their bags. But while keeping it, they replaced it with an identical package of costume jewellery, the police said.
In all the four cases, the women realised they had been cheated and robbed only after reaching home. They lost gold bangles, earring, and a gold chain, the police said.
The men have been caught on CCTV footage of the places where the women had been targeted but they had their faces covered in masks and were wearing caps, the police said. The CCTV grabs have been circulated across all police stations in Calcutta and in the Bidhannagar commissionerate’s jurisdiction.
“The description and modus operandi of the men matches with that of the members of the Irani gang. These men spoke in Hindi and broken Bengali. They were tall and well built… they used the same way to cheat and rob old people walking alone on roads just like the Irani gang,” an officer in Lalbazar said.
The Irani gang was active in Bowbazar, Girish Park, Hare Street and Burrabazar a few years ago. Members used to pose as cops. Investigations had then revealed that multiple gangs from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh had operated in Calcutta in a similar way in the past.
The gang chose their target, considering the fact the elderly are more vulnerable during the pandemic and it is easier to confuse them citing the lockdown, the police said.
“If someone poses as a police officer and tells an elderly person on the road that it is unsafe to wear gold jewellery because roads are deserted during the lockdown, chances are they will get scared and listen to the advice. This gang utilised this opportunity,” an officer said.
The police are collecting more CCTV footage to get a picture of the motorcycle’s number plate.",states
25 people can pray at St Paul’s Cathedral from today," The Church of North India’s Calcutta diocese will start prayer and meditation with a maximum of 25 people at a time at St Paul’s Cathedral and six other churches from Sunday, Reverend Paritosh Canning, the bishop of Calcutta, said on Saturday.
Till now, up to 10 people were allowed.
The prayers at St Paul’s Cathedral will be held in four sessions on Sunday — at 7.30am, 8.30am, 10.30am and 5.30pm.
The remaining six churches where prayers with 25 people will start from Sunday are in Hedua, Bhowanipore and Howrah.
The prayers will be held following the state government’s social distancing guidelines, the bishop said.
The number of faithful allowed to pray together will be increased to 25 people in 23 other CNI churches from July 5.",states
Passengers from Bangladesh chased and quarantined after landing at Calcutta airport," Several people who arrived in the city from Bangladesh on Saturday played cat and mouse with police at the airport terminal to avoid going to a quarantine facility.
A US Bangla Airlines flight with 164 evacuees on board arrived at the Calcutta airport from Dhaka in the morning. Most of the passengers — mostly labourers without work for months because of Covid-19 — refused to go to any quarantine centre and wanted to return home.
Cops first pleaded with them and then gave chase with raised batons after many tried to make a run for it. They managed to catch those who tried to run away and put them on two buses that took them to a government-run quarantine centre off the Bypass.
The government, in an attempt to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, has made it mandatory for all those flying back from abroad to spend a week at a paid quarantine centre and a week thereafter in home isolation.
“We decided to deploy a strong police contingent to ensure people follow quarantine rules. The quarantine protocol is being followed across the country and we can’t be an exception and allow people to return home putting others at risk,” J. Mercy, deputy commissioner, airport, the Bidhannagar commissionerate, said.
The Telegraph was present at the airport when the Bangladesh flight landed. A group of passengers stepped out of the building, arguing loudly with cops and government officials. They sat on the floor once officials told them that they could not be allowed to return home.
A few men in their late 20s tried to make a dash for it through the crash barriers and were chased by RAF personnel and an officer who caught up with them before they could breach the holding area.
The Telegraph had reported on Saturday that Bengal had asked the Centre to stop international evacuation flights to Calcutta unless it ensured passengers had booked paid quarantine facilities for themselves before boarding a flight.
The move followed instances of fliers heading home and not a quarantine unit from the airport. This newspaper had written on Thursday about a fiasco over 143 fliers from Malaysia who refused to go to any paid quarantine centre after landing at the airport around 7pm on Tuesday and instead headed home.
The passengers, who were mostly labourers without work, had sat on the floor in the arrival section for close to seven hours before being allowed to leave.
On Friday, it was decided that all evacuees would be told to book a paid quarantine unit and would be taken to the arrival lounge in groups of 20.
“The fact that smaller groups of fliers were brought out in phases ensured we could easily put them on buses though most did not want to go to a quarantine unit,” an airport official said.
A flight from the US landed at the airport on Saturday afternoon while another carrying stranded Indians from Hong Kong landed at night, the official said.
Last week, all 140 passengers on a flight from Kyrgyzstan had refused to go to a paid quarantine unit and left for home. A similar scene had unfolded at the airport on Thursday night, too, after an Air India flight with 157 evacuees from Kyrgyzstan landed around 9pm. The passengers, mostly medical students, refused to go to any paid quarantine unit and had to be allowed to return home.",states
HC stays teacher transfer clause," The high court on Friday stayed the operation of a clause of the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Act, 2017, which allows the government to transfer state-aided schoolteachers for administrative reasons.
The interim order, for now, takes away the school education department’s right to transfer a teacher without her/his consent.
In the same order, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharya stayed the transfer of four teachers from the state-aided Satashi High School, Jagachha, Howrah, to schools in other districts.
Four teachers of the school had moved court after they got transfer orders on June 4 and were released by the school managing committee within two days in the middle of the lockdown.
The amendment to the school service commission act in 2017 empowered the government to transfer a state-aided schoolteacher or an employee to a similar institution against any sanctioned post “in the interest of public service for administrative reasons”.
The objective of the amendment was to enable the government to maintain a proper teacher-student ratio across its 14,000-odd secondary schools by transferring surplus staff from one institution to another with a shortfall.
Before the amendment, transfers of state-aided schoolteachers and employees were based on the concept of “mutual and general” ones. In a mutual transfer, two teachers could swap schools if both had similar qualifications and experience.
In a general transfer, a teacher wanting to move to another state-aided school had to file an application. The transfer was allowed only if there was a suitable vacancy in that particular institution.
Staying the amendment on Friday, the judge held that the new legislature was ultra vires to the Constitution as the service condition at the time of recruiting the four teachers did not include a provision by which they could be transferred citing administrative reasons.
Ekramul Bari, who appeared for Debabrata Kanji and three other teachers, said the transfer decision was “vindictive”. There cannot be any administrative reason to transfer the four teachers as the decision has been taken when all education institutions are closed because of Covid-19, Bari said.
Advocate general Kishore Datta, who appeared for the government, told the court that the amendment intended to improve the academic standard of state-aided schools by rationalising the distribution of teachers and other staff.
The judge asked Datta to file an affidavit in opposition and announced that the matter would be heard in detail later.",states
Higher education department's final semester plan," The Bengal higher education department has told universities that final-year students will be assessed in their terminal examination by factoring in 80 per cent “on the basis of best aggregate percentage obtained by the candidate in any of the previous semester/year’s results and 20 per cent on the internal semester during the current semester/year”.
The advisory, issued on Saturday evening and circulated among vice-chancellors, says in case of an undergraduate student, the best aggregate in the last five semesters has to be considered.
“In case of a postgraduate student, the best aggregate in the last three semesters has to be considered,” said an official.
The universities have been asked to declare the “final year/semester results preferably within July 31”.
If a student wishes to appear in a formal examination instead of the alternative method as has been spelt out in the advisory, he or she will be given an opportunity to apply for the exam through a process to be notified by the university concerned, another official said. “However, the exam should be conducted only after the situation gets normal and the result of the special exam may be published within one month of the exam,” he said.

The advisory has prompted Jadavpur University to convene a meeting of its examination board next week.
In engineering, the university had announced on June 12 that students would be assessed factoring in 30 per cent weightage from the previous semester (best aggregate) and the rest through internal assessment (home assignment).
In arts, one of the two assessment parameters had said students would be graded factoring in 60 per cent weightage from the previous semester (best aggregate) and the rest through internal assessment (home assignment).
Pradip Ghosh, a JU pro-VC, said: “We have got the advisory and the university will take steps it deems necessary.”
The department has said that the students for the intermediate semesters/years would be promoted to the next semester/year.",states
Two 200-year-old trees in IIEST campus back on feet," Human hands and the heavy metal of a crane have together tried to undo nature’s doing on two 200-year-old trees on the western bank of the Hooghly.
On the IIEST Shibpur campus, two mahogany trees overlooking the Oval ground could not take the onslaught of Cyclone Amphan and fell. They were back on their feet on Friday evening.
The two trees were planted when land for the institute was allocated in 1820 by the Botanic Garden of India and Lord Hastings served as the Governor General. Calcutta was the crown jewel of the pink empire then.
Gusts of wind howling at over at 130km an hour had slammed Calcutta on May 20 — easily the fiercest storm in this neck of the woods in over a century.
Storms have always taken a heavy toll on trees in Calcutta but this year was exceptional. More than 15,000 trees fell. And the human response, too, was like never before. Hundreds of trees have been replanted in Calcutta and the neighbouring districts in the past few weeks in the most concerted effort to restore quickly some of the city’s ravaged green roof.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM A group of horticulturists took up the job on the verge of the Oval ground in Shibpur. Leaves are expected to sprout in full in a month’s time, given the rainy monsoon the city has had, they said on Saturday.
The destruction wreaked by the cyclone had “brought the attention back to the existence of the trees invaluable for their sheer history”, an IIEST official said.
The chapel of the college is about five metres from the two mahogany trees. History has it that (poet, reformer) Michael Madhusudan Dutt would spend countless hours tending to the trees. He loved nature. The chapel is now named Madhusudan Bhavan.
The two trees were witness to the series of events that led to the arrival of the college from the other bank of the Hooghly.
A professor at the institute said Calcutta Civil Engineering College, which was set up at Writers’ Buildings in 1856 after some years at the erstwhile Presidency College, landed on the present campus as The Government College, Howrah, in 1880. Bishop’s College shifted to Calcutta when the tech school crossed over.
The Botanic Garden authorities had allocated almost 21 acres on its southeast corner to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel. That land transfer led to the birth of Bishop’s College.
An IIEST official said Michael Madhsudan Dutt had joined the secular department of Bishop’s College in 1844 to learn Latin, Greek and Sanskrit.
“The East India Company had planted sal and teak trees apart from banyan, mahogany, walnut, peepal, gulmohar, and copper pot for ships that were then made of wood,” Bivore Das, an assistant registrar and a researcher on the history of the campus, said. “Since it was expensive to get wood from Rangoon, the trees were planted. The two trees are the oldest among the 16 mahogany varieties on the 121-acre campus. Sabyasachi Sengupta, a former registrar of the institute who had graduated from the government engineering college (the previous avatar of IIEST) in 1973, said he remembered the trees as they overlooked the Oval cricket ground, their favourite retreat outside the classroom.
“The ground was developed after the college came to the campus. I can still visualise the manual scoreboard set up at a spot between the two mahogany trees and the clubhouse during our cricket matches,” Sengupta, a former professor of IIT Kharagpur, said.
The ground was named the Oval by the British for its shape, just like its international counterpart at Kennington in South London.
“The two mahogany trees added to the majestic view of the ground. We are happy to restore them,” Parthasarathi Chakrabarti, the director of the institute, said.
Gajender Singh, one of the horticulturists said: “The monsoon has set in; the leaves are expected to come very soon.”
Time will tell if man has been able to restore what nature had almost taken away.",states
CPM hits streets to protest fuel price hike," The CPM and the Trinamul Congress found in fuel price hike a common reason to pack a punch at the Narendra Modi government for putting further burden on the people who are already reeling from the adverse economic consequences of the prolonged lockdown.
On Friday, CPM legislator Sujan Chakraborty, along with his party activists, took out a cycle rally in south Calcutta to protest the spiralling rise of fuel prices. Chakraborty led the bicycle rally from 8B bus stand in Jadavpur to protest outside the Indian Oil Bhavan in Dhakuria, covering a distance of 1.7km.
“Petroleum prices in the international market are at least one third of what an Indian has to pay today. If the crude oil prices are low, why are fuel prices in India going north?” Chakraborty said at the end of the rally.
Though CPM activists attacked the Centre, they did not spare the state government for not waiving off cess that would bring down the price of fuel. They demanded that the state government waive off cess on petroleum products.
The CPM had organised similar rallies in other parts of the state as well. Around a hundred supporters of the CPM’s youth wing DYFI walked with their motorbikes for around 8km at Rampurhat town in Birbhum.

Amitava Singh, the Birbhum district president of the DYFI, said: “It has become difficult for people to ride their bikes as the price of petrol has become too much to bear. As a mark of protest, we decided not to ride our bikes but drag them along.”
Similar protests were witnessed at Nalhati’s Lohapur, Bolpur and a few other places in Birbhum. The DYFI has called for protests against fuel hike across the state on June 26 and 27.
“All the districts will witness the protests on these two days. In East Burdwan, we will protest on Saturday,” said Pralay Aich, state vice-president of DYFI.
Both the student and youth wings of the CPM have been demonstrating against the continuous fuel price hike for the past few days. On Thursday, SFI and DYFI members dragged their scooters and motorbikes in a rally as a mark of protest in Calcutta.
Trinamul Congress leaders have taken to the social media to protest against the fuel price hike. Mamata Banerjee’s party has launched an online campaign with a hashtag which reads “Modibabu Petrol Bekaabu”. The Bengali sentence literally translates to “Mr. Modi, petrol is out of control,” in English.
During a press briefing at Nabanna on Friday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee attacked the Union government for its inability to keep fuel prices within limits.
“Prices of petrol and diesel are increasing continuously. At some places diesel is costlier than petrol. I don’t understand what is happening,” Banerjee said.
On Saturday, all district presidents of Trinamul have been asked to hold press conferences in their respective districts. These leaders have been asked by the party high command to speak on how the state government has been successfully able to combat the coronavirus and Amphan crises.
“However, we will also bring up the issue of hike in petrol prices in our briefings,” said a Trinamul district president who asked not to be identified.",states
Migrant job report ready," The Bengal government has compiled a report suggesting that at least nine districts in the state could have qualified for the Centre’s Rs 50,000 crore scheme to provide jobs to migrant workers who returned home during the lockdown.
Sources said the Mamata Banerjee government planned to place the report before an all-party committee, which the chief minister Mamata Banerjee set up two days back, to establish its charge that the BJP-led Centre was depriving migrants from Bengal of the scheme’s benefits.
The Garib Kalyan Abhiyaan scheme is to be implemented in 116 districts spread across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha.
Questions were raised in administrative and political circles of Bengal as none of the districts in the state, which recorded return of over 10 lakh migrants during the pandemic, made it to the list.
“The state government took an initiative to prepare a district-wise list of returnees and it is clear nine districts could have qualified for inclusion in the scheme,” said a senior official.
That report, sources said, would be placed before the all-party committee that had been asked to prepare a charter of demands for workers of unorganised sector and migrant workers. The demands would be adopted as a resolution that would be sent to the Centre and the state government.
“The committee comprises representatives of the CPM, other Left parties, Congress and the BJP, in addition to those of ruling Trinamul. If the panel is convinced that the migrants of the state were deprived of the scheme intentionally, the state would win the perception battle as it has been accusing the Centre of denying the state it dues,” said a source.
The issue of non-inclusion of the state in the scheme was raised during the all-party meeting chaired by Mamata in Calcutta this week and several non-BJP parties demanded that migrants of Bengal also get opportunities to earn livelihood in the home state.
“If all non-BJP parties write that Bengal was left out of the scheme without valid reasons, the claim of the state government would be established,” said another source while adding that the primary report is now being fine-tuned with inputs from districts.
According to the primary report, Cooch Behar and Murshidabad topped the list with 1.4 lakh returnees. Besides, districts like Malda, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, Howrah, East Midnapore and West Midnapore all recorded 50,000-plus returnees each. In case of Nadia, the number was around 30,000.
“The list was prepared based on the number of workers returned from other states. The list does not include workers who returned home in one district from the other in the state,” said a source.
Sources said the top brass of the state government had no clue why the state had not been included in the scheme.
“Initially, we were told that the state had not sent any list of districts where at least 25,000 migrant workers had returned. But we did not find any letter from Delhi asking us to send any such list before the programme was launched,” said another official.",states
Coal FDI protest," Mamata Banerjee on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, registering her protest against the Centre’s policy to allow 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the coal mining sector.
In her letter, the Bengal chief minister said the decision would neither bring FDI nor new technologies to the country and requested Modi to reconsider the decision.
While mentioning coal is the country’s pride, the chief minister pointed out that Coal India Limited (CIL), the world’s largest coal mining company, had made a profit of Rs 27,000 crore in 2018-19 and held a reserve of Rs 31,000 crore.
Mamata stressed that the FDI decision would demean the company’s capability.
The chief minister also mentioned that allowing cent percent FDI in coal mining would send a wrong message at a time the Prime Minister was focusing on building a self-reliant India or “Atmanirbhar Bharat”.

“Moreover, allowing 100% FDI in Coal for MNCs will carry a wrong message as it would contradict the very essence of Atmanirbhar Bharat and would also kill the vision of self-reliant policy that we have been following since beginning,” reads the letter of the chief minister.
Sources close to Mamata said the chief minister had raised the issue as she believed that allowing 100 per cent FDI in coal sector would not help the country draw foreign investment as more than 100 globally significant financial institutes had divested from coal trade over the past few years.
“It would not help the country bring FDI but it can destabilise the public sector dealing with the trade for years. This is why the chief minister is worried,” said a source.
The government’s move to open up the coal sector, the source added, has not borne fruit so far as local players have evinced little interest.
The chief minister also opposed the decision of shifting desk offices of four subsidiary companies of CIL from Calcutta to their respective headquarters and urged Prime Minister to reconsider the decision.
“The recent abrupt decision to shift the desk offices of four of its subsidiary companies namely Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL), Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL), South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) and Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) from Kolkata to their respective headquarters in other areas will be extremely detrimental to the interests of all stakeholders of Coal sector including employees,” the chief minister wrote.",states
CM attacks ‘crisis’ politics by BJP," Mamata Banerjee on Friday criticised the BJP, though without naming it, for the recent surge in on-the-ground activities by the party during crises like Covid-19 and Cyclone Amphan in Bengal.
“Going and vandalising, here and there. Fomenting trouble, wherever. This attitude of some political party is exceeding all bounds. We, too, had spent decades in the Opposition. We have been in politics for a lifetime… there are some basic courtesies expected of political parties,” said the Trinamul Congress chief.
The chief minister said she did not feel the need to name the party, but “they understand who they are anyway”.
“Covid-19, Amphan… crisis after crisis. But your behaviour in the name of Opposition has not shown any sign of taking the backseat even at such a time. Ransacking of police stations, BDO offices? Why damage public property?”
“Why provoke others to do so?” Mamata asked, referring to inflammatory statements and activities by several senior leaders of the state BJP in recent weeks.

Realising the Assembly elections next year would be won or lost over issues related to the pandemic, the crisis of migrant workers and the cyclone, the BJP veered off the course of amicable cooperation amid the crises and mounted a fierce political campaign against Mamata, her government and her party.
Initially on the backfoot and caught off guard, Mamata, too, recovered to launch several political counter-measures.
“I held an all-party meeting… come, let’s all work together. There will be such a lot of time later for meetings and rallies. There is no need for them right now. Even the most important religious events are not being held properly, why will your small events take place now?” she asked.
Mamata hinted that her party might not hold its biggest annual event on July 21 this year, at least not in its conventional form.
“During the lockdown, we are not carrying out any political assembly. The Centre’s Disaster Management Act, in place now. Such assemblies are not taking place. Even our July 21 programme, it’s massive, just once a year. But even there, this time, we will not do it like that.”
“We will decide at a meeting on July 3 how we can do it by ensuring social distancing and all other norms…. But some party, I have been noticing, by sheer use of force, without any permission from police, without listening to them, without obeying their own central disaster management law, are going and conducting meetings and rallies as they please,” she added.
She then questioned the barrage of allegations against being implicated “falsely” in cases that the BJP’s state leaders have recently been going to town with.
“The law is the same for all and its violation will invite action for anybody, me or you. You will break the law, ransack, vandalise and then question FIRs,” she said.
“Toying with the laws of the land…. Terrorism of language being unleashed. Democracy gives the freedom of speech, but the language they use is terrorism…. The people are not taking kindly to this,” she added.
The chief minister then questioned the Centre over letting trains and planes operate, allegedly without adequate checks and balances, while expecting the state to ensure the outbreak remains restricted.
Mamata also accused the Centre of denying Bengal its legitimate dues. “We got nothing (from the Centre), at least let us try to restrict the outbreak and its spread,” she added. “When will they give us our Rs 53,000 crore in dues? On top of that, their leaders here will only say big things.”",states
Schemes in minority hubs," Mamata Banerjee on Friday inaugurated over 620 projects, including schools, hostels, drinking water and healthcare facilities and shopping complexes, in blocks with high concentration of minority communities.
Sources in the Bengal minorities affairs department said in terms of numbers, the inaugurations on Friday were among the highest in recent memory.
“We have inaugurated several facilities and laid foundation stones for a number of projects today. The schemes would benefit people of the state and we will keep developing more infrastructure projects in coming days,” the chief minister said while launching the projects from Nabanna.
Most of the schemes were or are implemented by the minorities affairs department.
Mamata has always preferred to inaugurate projects during her visits to different districts in which she used to hold administrative meetings, followed by political programmes.

That model of interaction with local administration and direct communication with the electorate thereafter had to be abandoned because of Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown.
“She is, however, aware that Assembly elections are approaching and the BJP is intensifying its anti-government activities... So, she has also launched her preparations for the polls,” said a source close to Mamata.
The list of inaugurations, government sources said, included karmatirthas, shopping complexes where minorities run shops, hostels for boys and girls, heal sub-centres, community centres, anganwadi centres, additional class rooms in schools and drinking water supply schemes in Malda, North Dinajpur, Cooch Behar, Nadia and Birbhum.
All these districts have sizable minority population, said a source, before adding that the list of projects was more than 620.
“Some of these projects had been undertaken a few years ago and as they were ready, the chief minister decided to inaugurate them at one go. In normal circumstances, she would have liked to visit the districts to inaugurate them. As she cannot wait for normalcy to return, she launched them from Nabanna,” said a senior minority affairs department official.
Sources in the ruling establishment said the government was trying to send out a message to the minority community, the core support base of the Trinamul Congress, at a time multiple forces were at play to erode Mamata’s credibility in their eyes.
The BJP’s social media cell had tried to create an impression that the Mamata administration was not keen to facilitate the return of migrants who were stranded outside Bengal during the lockdown. A significant majority of migrants are Muslims.
“The ruling party wants to change the false perception through its actions,” said a source.
According to him, apparent rise of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen also prompted the chief minister to reach out to the minority community, which makes up around 30 per cent of the electorate, with dedicated schemes. ",states
Government official tests positive," A deputy magistrate in Durgapur tested Covid-19 positive on Friday.
Sources said the WBCS (executive) officer was suffering from fever and fell ill at his office on Thursday. He was admitted to a private hospital where his swab sample was collected and the test report arrived on Friday.
The officer has been shifted to Sanaka Covid Hospital here. This is the first such incident of a senior government officer testing positive for coronavirus in West Burdwan.
Shortly after the officer was tested positive, the district administration sealed and sanitised the three-storeyed administrative building that also houses the offices of the additional chief judicial magistrate and the additional district judge court.
Altogether, 50 government employees, including the SDO of Durgapur Anirban Koley have been sent to compulsory home quarantine till Monday.

Nod to MPharm at North Bengal University," The Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) has approved the post graduate course in pharmacy at the North Bengal University and also approved more number of seats than what the varsity had allotted for students pursuing Master of Pharmacy (MPharm).
The two year course was introduced in the department of pharmaceutical technology of the NBU with 18 seats last year. Varsity sources said that the PCI granted had 30 seats for the course considering the infrastructure and teaching method of the varsity.
Students with a BPharm degree are eligible to apply for M.Pharm.
“It is a multi-dimensional course as on one hand, it offers a professional degree while on the other hand, one can study higher levels of a non-conventional science stream. It is good that soon after we have introduced the course, we could get approval from the PCI, that too with more seats,” said Pranab Ghosh, professor and the head of the department of pharmaceutical technology at the NBU.
The varsity has also introduced research facilities in the field, said sources. ",states
Total lockdown in Mirik till July 1," A total lockdown was clamped down in the Mirik subdivision from Friday through July 1 as 10 Covid-19 cases were reported in and the around the hill town.
“A number of coronavirus cases were reported in Mirik in the past few days. We are urging people not to panic. But simultaneously, we have decided to close down markets and other commercial establishments in the Mirik subdivision for the next seven days. People have to stay at home and unless there is an emergency, they should not venture out to Siliguri,” said Mirik SDO Ashwini Roy.
Mirik is located around 50km Siliguri.
“We want to make it clear that if any person is found returning from outside the subdivision or wandering in the town without any reason, appropriate action will be taken against him/her,” the SDO added.
Banks, healthcare facilities and other emergency services would be open during the lockdown, said sources.
The sources said 10 coronavirus cases had been reported in the Mirik subdivision so far. The patients include a doctor of Mirik block hospital and three nurses.
The authorities have decided to send a team of 28 people — comprising 19 ICDS workers and nine health workers of the civic body — to all houses in the Mirik municipal area on June 30 and July 1 to check if any resident has Covid-19 symptoms.
On Thursday, the SDO and other officials held a meeting with civic authorities, including Mirik municipal chairman L.B. Rai.
“The objective of the lockdown is to restrict the infection in and around Mirik town. For the next seven days, I would like to request all the residents to restrict their movement and not to leave their homes unless required,” said Rai.
The sources have said the Mirik town and the subdivision are entirely dependent on Siliguri.
“We have information that around 250 coronavirus and 14 deaths have been reported in Siliguri so far. That is why we are restricting the movement of the residents,” said Rai.
Malda recorded 25 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. The patients include seven policemen, an employee of the district collectorate and an office-bearer of a trade body.",states
GTA to launch e-governance," The Gorkhaland Territorial Administration is embracing e-governance to do away with the age-old bureaucratic practice of maintaining files, a system that was riddled with the problem of “missing files”.
Anit Thapa, the chairman, board of administrators, GTA, said in a written statement: “To promote transparency, convenience, efficiency, accountability, data security and data integrity in governance, we have decided to take steps to start moving towards the e-governance platform in all GTA offices.”
The Mamata Banerjee government has also embraced e-governance in most of its administrative wings.
Sources in the GTA said the e-office system had already started.
A GTA official said the hill body was not paying for digitisation. “It is a government-sponsored scheme and we are not paying for it. It is being executed by the National Informatics Centre and the Bengal government.”

The hill body annually receives around Rs 1,000 crore as plan, non-plan and sectoral funds which do not include amounts received for projects sponsored by the central government.
Since the days of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council to the present day of the GTA, there have always been innumerable complaints of files disappearing and at times reappearing out of thin air. “All files will now move online right from initiation to conclusion and everything will be tracked. There would be a complete stop on physical movements of files,” said a GTA official.
All GTA offices in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts have been connected and the finance department will be acting as the resource centre.
“Earlier, files would go missing sometime while moving from say the Lewis Jubilee (GTA offices) or Kalimpong offices to Lal Khoti (administrative headquarters),” the official said.
While all new files are being digitised, GTA sources said they would also start digitising old records. “Files regarding works which have already been completed will also be digitised in the next phase,” said an official.
A supplier associated with the GTA welcomed the move.
“I have had the experience of files missing and then reappearing after repeated visits to various offices,” said the supplier, who suggested that such a system be introduced at civic bodies as well.",states
Hint at Metro with seated passengers," Metro services may resume from July 1 if it can be ensured the trains run only with seated passengers, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday.
Railway and Metro officials said they were awaiting a formal communication from the state government but had started weighing options to control the number of passengers.
Metro officials said that among the Covid-19 curbs being planned were the suspension of tokens and access for only smart-card users, and ensuring crowd control right from the station gates. Metro services have been suspended since March 25.
In the afternoon, the chief minister told a news conference: “We have spoken to Metro Railway. The trains can run if the seats are sanitised.... People will benefit from the resumption of Metro services.”
Mamata added: “But please prevent overcrowding. Metro already has a system in place… there are automated gates. Only people with tickets can enter through the gates. So, they should look into the existing system, how to use it.

“The trains can run from July 1 if social distancing is maintained, overcrowding prevented and only passengers who can be seated are allowed. We will request the public to avoid a rush.”
In a video conference on Friday, Railway Board chairperson Vinod Kumar Yadav said from New Delhi in response to questions on the Metro: “We have not received any request from the state government. We will be able to take any decision after getting a request from the state government.... We will have to jointly work with the state government.”
Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said the commercial services would start only after the go-ahead arrived from the railway board.
“We have been coordinating with the state government. Together, we will work out the modalities, some of which are already in place,” Banerjee said.
Metro officials spelled out the challenges. Before the suspension, the Metro attracted a daily average of 600,000-plus passengers. Maintaining social-distancing among even a third or fourth of that number would be daunting, officials said.
“For now, we are planning to let in only smart-card users. Tokens have the risk of contamination. The number of smart-card users is comparatively low, too,” a Metro official said.
An eight-coach Metro train can seat around 400-420 people. Officials said the trains may be run with a curtailed seating capacity to ensure social distancing.
However, keeping track of the number of passengers will be challenging because of the multiple origin and destination points. “There are 24 stations from where people get on and off the trains. We are not equipped to keep real-time track of the smart cards swiped at every gate,” a Metro official said.
Metro officials are also working on a plan to enforce crowd control at the station entrances and again at the concourses so the “platforms don’t get overcrowded”.
Social-distancing needs to be maintained not only on the platforms and the trains but also in the queues at the entry points.
At some stations, the floor in front of the ticket counters has already been marked to ensure people stand well apart from one another. Seating arrangements on the platforms have also been altered.
The Metro used to run 288 trains every weekday before the services were stopped. “The number would probably go down,” a senior official said.",states
July HS papers cancelled," The pending papers of the higher secondary exams that students were scheduled to write on July 2, 6 and 8 have been cancelled, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Friday.
Later, the president of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, Mahua Das, said: “We will take the best marks from the papers they had written before the lockdown and that would be awarded for the papers they could not write.”
Das said if any examinee was not satisfied with the methodology, he or she could appear in the written test once the situation became normal. “The marks obtained in that examination will be taken into account. We are trying to publish the HS results within July,” said Das.
“Whatever will be the best grades will be considered for the cancelled papers,” said an official of the HS council.
“The education department has decided to cancel the exams of the pending higher secondary papers, adhering to the recommendation of an expert committee and the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education,” said Chatterjee.
The announcement came a day after the CBSE and the CISCE told the Supreme Court that they were cancelling the pending papers of their Class X and XII exams because of the Covid-19 epidemic. The CISCE conducts ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) exams.",states
CM nudge on fees that are ‘no longer relevant’," Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday urged private schools to consider not charging fees that were “no longer relevant during the lockdown” and requested parents not to say they “wouldn’t pay any fees at all”.
“I have received a letter. Some schools are charging fees in the name of computer training and laboratory facilities. Schools should not charge anything for these,” Mamata said at a news conference on Friday.
“Schools are free to collect fees as they were (last year) without any increase… because you have to pay teachers, maintain schools. I agree with you on this point.
“Parents have to pay fees to private schools. But I would make a request to private schools. It is true that no one has gone to schools for the past three months for any computer training. He/she has not visited the library to study. Money shouldn’t be charged under these heads.
“You charge the fees that have been fixed at the start of the year. It is true that the teachers have to be paid salaries, schools have to be maintained, and gatekeepers have to be paid.”

In her appeal to parents, she said it would not be proper of schools to increase fees now. “On the other hand, some are trying to play politics on the matter and saying they would not pay any fees at all. This is also not correct... because schools, too, have to pay salaries to teachers.”
The government has told private schools several times not to increase fees and most schools have followed it. But parents have been demanding that schools reduce some of the fee components.
Mamata spoke on the matter a day after Reverend Thomas D’Souza, the archbishop of Calcutta, said eight unaided ICSE schools run by the archdiocese of Calcutta would waive half their annual fees. “This decision was taken considering the difficulties of parents in the present situation….,” the archbishop told Metro on Thursday.
Mamata said: “Let schools charge the annual fees that are required to pay teachers’ salaries…. Don’t charge students under various heads like computer training or library. There are many other components. I don’t have knowledge about all. Fees that are charged for sports. Extra fees. Don’t charge or increase extra fees under such heads now please.... If you do this, how will the common man pay? You have to run the institutions.”
“Common people don’t have money. How will they pay anything extra? Everybody does not work in the government sector…. In the private sector many people have lost their jobs. Let us all behave in a humane way in this situation.”",states
CMC nod to forest department’s plantation plan," The forest department will plant trees along some roads in Calcutta, making a departure from the usual practice of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation solely planting trees.
The trees to be planted will be about 15ft tall and aged between six and 10, a forest department official said. The department will nurture the trees for two years from the day of plantation before handing over their custody to the civic body.
The forest department, according to naturalists, is better equipped to deal with avenue plantation than the CMC and the move to involve the department in planting trees could augur well for the city.
The roads where the department will plant trees are: Southern Avenue, the Rashbehari Avenue-Ruby connector, Park Street, Ballygunge Circular Road, Gariahat Road, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, EM Bypass and on stretches of Alipore.
The CMC has given its nod after the department wrote to it. The decision to involve the department was taken in a meeting at the civic headquarters after Cyclone Amphan where officials of the forest and environment departments were present.

“We have given our nod to the forest department. They can start planting trees along these roads,” Debashis Kumar, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators who is in charge of parks and gardens and urban forestry departments, said.
Forest minister Rajib Banerjee said the department would plant trees along close to 100km of roads in Calcutta. “This is the first time that the forest department will get involved in planting trees in Calcutta on such a large scale,” Banerjee said.
The department plans to plant about 5,000 trees within Calcutta, a forest official said.
Thousands of trees in the city were uprooted when Cyclone Amphan struck on May 20. Some estimates have put the number of uprooted trees at over 5,000 while some have put it over 15,000.
No one actually counted how many trees fell and the numbers are rough estimates, a CMC official said.
A naturalist told Metro that he expected a scientific approach in planting the trees. “Species selection is very important. If there is little space then trees that do not have a broad canopy should be planted. Also, a diverse range of trees should be planted,” he said.
The forest department should ensure that the space surrounding the location of the tree is not covered with concrete paver blocks. That will allow the surface roots to expand, the naturalist said.
The forest department has decided to plant a variety of trees, including Bokul, Arjun, Neem and Tabebuia rosea, an official said.
The department will ensure the trees are not destroyed by cattle or human vandalism and that they are properly watered during the two years they will be in the department’s custody, the official said. “We will keep props and guards around the trees.”",states
Fishing cat ‘poisoned and killed’ in Howrah," A fishing cat, Bengal’s state animal, was poisoned and killed in a village in Howrah on June 11, animal lovers and some villagers have alleged.
They said the fishing cat was pregnant and that it had been poisoned. A forest official said there was no conclusive evidence of either.
More than a fortnight has passed since the carcass was found near a water body in a village in Amta Block I, around 40km from the heart of Calcutta. The forest department has so far registered a case of an “undetected offence”.
Fishing cat, baghrol in Bengali, is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and included in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Killing the animal can lead to five years in jail.
The June 11 incident, from Udang village in Amta Block I, was reported to the forest department by a schoolteacher. The fishing cat was found by a group of residents near a water body.
Raju Sarkar, the divisional forest officer of Howrah, said the post-mortem report showed the cat had died of head injuries. “The official reason of death was trauma from cardio-respiratory failure.”
Sarkar said tests did not find any “conclusive evidence” that the animal had been poisoned. Asked if it was pregnant, Sarkar said he had no such information.
There has been no arrest so far, he said. “We have drawn up a case of an undetected offence.”
“Some residents said the cat was pregnant and that it had been poisoned because it was feeding on fish from the water body. If the cat was pregnant then at least three more cats were killed, along with the mother,” Tiasa Adhya, a member of Human and Environment Alliance League, said.
The body had injury marks on the head, indicating the animal was first poisoned and then hit on the head, Adhya said.
Adhya has been researching on fishing cats in Bengal for close to a decade.
A day before the Amta incident another fishing cat was trapped, killed and skinned — apparently for its meat — by some residents of a village in West Midnapore. Metro had reported that killing. Of the two suspects in the West Midnapore case, one has been arrested, a forest official said.
The nocturnal animal thrives in wetlands and feeds mostly on fish. Their numbers have dwindled because of shrinking wetlands forcing them to stray into human settlements and prey on fish in ponds and livestock.
The forest department has launched multiple initiatives to spread awareness about fishing cats and promote their conservation.",states
"Doctor fee, Covid-19 test and PPE rates of private hospitals capped"," Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Friday that private hospitals could not charge more than Rs 2,250 for a Covid-19 swab test and no patient could be charged more than Rs 1,000 a day for personal protection equipment.
Mamata also said the state government had capped consultation fees of doctors treating Covid-19 patients at private hospitals at Rs 1,000 a day. The fee at some hospitals, she said,is as high as Rs 5,000 a day.
The decision to cap fees follows complaints of overcharging by some private hospitals.
The government had earlier requested private hospitals and laboratories to reduce the rate of the Covid-19 test but there was no attempt at capping it.
“The test was costing Rs 4,500. We have told private hospitals that it should be done at Rs 2,250,” Mamata said on Friday.

An official at a private hospital said that since the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had first capped the price at Rs 4,500, many hospitals were charging the amount. Later, ICMR asked state governments to request hospitals to reduce the rate.
In Bengal, private hospitals have reduced their rates following a request from the government.
“This is the first time the government is mentioning any rate for Bengal. We were charging Rs 2,500 for the Covid test. We are fine with Rs 2,250,” said Sudipto Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital.
As for consultation fees of doctors treating Covid patients at private hospitals (not the ones designated as Covid treatment centres), the chief minister said: “Private hospitals were charging Rs 5,000 a day as doctor’s consultation fee. We have asked the hospitals to keep it within Rs 1,000.”
The Telegraph had on June 19 reported that chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had asked officials of private hospitals to conduct the Covid-19 test at the lowest possible rate, not to overcharge patients for PPE and display the number of Covid beds available daily.
On Friday, Mamata said: “Some hospitals have reduced the rates. We thank them. Some are yet to reduce. An expert team is working on restricting charges in private hospitals”.
On PPE, she said: “Private hospitals can charge a patient Rs 1,000 a day for PPE.”
Rupak Barua, the group CEO of AMRI Hospitals, said: “We charge what is the expense. What we are charging for PPE is to keep the hospital protected. It is also our duty to provide safety to all our healthcare personnel… administrative staff and housekeeping and security staff…. We have reduced the PPE price compared with what we were charging in April. We have been able to procure PPE at better rates and have passed on the benefit to patients.”
Asked about the cap on consultation fees, an official of a private hospital said the government should keep in mind that some Covid-19 patients are treated by multiple doctors.
“If a patient has co-morbidity, she/he may need consultation with a specialist. In that case, the government should allow the specialist to charge his/her consultation fee. But for someone who has no other issues, Rs 1,000 a day is fine,” the official said.
Mamata said charges could be capped for some items, too.",states
"Financial help for 6,000 private buses"," The owners of 6,000 buses will be given Rs 15,000 each a month for three months from July to help them bring out their vehicles, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday.
The total expenditure over three months will be Rs 27 crore.
Mamata made it clear that the state government would not immediately allow any fare hike and appealed to the operators of private buses and minibuses to roll out their vehicles from July 1.
Thousands of private buses have been off the roads with the operators demanding a fare hike to offset the loss being inflicted by a steep rise in the diesel price and a restriction on the number of passengers a vehicle can ferry.
Several operators said they would resume service but pointed out that the total bus count across the state was nearly four times the number being offered financial help. In Calcutta, the bus count stands at around 6,000, transport department officials said.

The selective help, they said, “could create a rift” among operators.
“Bus fares can’t be raised since we are accountable to the people. Our idea is to help people as much as possible. But we will also look after those who run buses,” Mamata said after meeting bus and minibus operators at Nabanna.
“We have decided to give Rs 15,000 to each of the 6,000 buses for the next three months beginning July 1. Sudhu manusher dikey taakiye (Just keeping the concerns of the people in mind). The operators will decide how they want to utilise the amount — whether as subsidy or commission. But they will bring the buses back on the roads from July 1.”
She added: “I don’t want any uncertainty among commuters whether they would be able to reach office or return home. The transport department will have to coordinate more closely with bus operators and the police to ensure that the waiting time of passengers at bus stops is reduced.”
Transport minister Suvendu Adhikari has asked bus union leaders to meet him on Monday to work out the modalities of payment.
The operators told the chief minister that the rise in diesel price — up by almost Rs 10 a litre over the past 25 days — and the restriction on the number of passengers had left them struggling to meet their ends.",states
Bengal rider for evacuation flights," Bengal has asked the Centre to stop international evacuation flights to Calcutta unless it ensures passengers have booked paid quarantine facilities for themselves before boarding a flight, a move that follows instances of fliers heading home from the airport instead of a quarantine unit.
Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha raised the demand in a letter he sent to the civil aviation ministry on Friday. Earlier in the day, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that the Centre would be asked to stop international evacuation flights from July 1.
Sources said Sinha mentioned in the letter that the Bengal government would withdraw the no-objection certificate for international evacuation flights if the ministry did not ensure that all passengers had booked hotels for paid quarantine before boarding a flight.
The state government, in an attempt to restrict the spread of Covid-19, has made it mandatory for all those flying back from abroad to spend a week at a paid quarantine unit and another week thereafter in home isolation.
“Covid is increasing all over India, all over the world. But I am seeing all international flights have started. The Centre has said those who would arrive from other countries would undergo seven days’ institutional quarantine, which is pay and use. The arrangements were also made for that. But I am seeing many flights coming and (passengers) are not prevented (from heading home from the airport),” Mamata said.
“Earlier, we had allowed international evacuation flights to Bengal on condition that the passengers would pre-book paid facilities and they would be allowed to board a flight after producing the documents. But that is not happening,” a senior state government official said. The chief minister said: “On the flight they are given paper on which they write the details. But after arrival, these papers are not checked. They are allowed to go. No health protocol is being followed. If this continues, how much will we control? Someone else’s irresponsible behaviour or decision or negligence will make it (Covid-19) spread in Bengal. This should not happen…. We are saying stop international flights because those who were supposed to come have already arrived. Have one flight a month, we have no objection.”
Referring to the international fliers who are refusing to go to a quarantine centre, she said: “How can we track them? You are saying testing, tracking, tracing. But there is not testing, no tracking, no tracing. In Bengal, we have kept it under control but it is spreading. It cannot go on.”
The Telegraph reported on Thursday about a fiasco over 143 fliers from Malaysia who refused to go to any paid quarantine centre after landing at the airport around 7pm on Tuesday and, instead, headed home. The passengers, mostly labourers who had been out of work for months because of Covid-19, sat on the floor in the arrival section for close to seven hours before they were allowed to leave. On Friday last week, all 140 passengers on a flight from Kyrgyzstan had refused to go to a paid quarantine unit and left for home.
A similar scene unfolded at the airport on Thursday night, too, after an Air India flight with 157 evacuees from Kyrgyzstan landed around 9pm. The passengers, mostly medical students, refused to go to any paid quarantine unit and were finally allowed to leave around 12.30am.
Later on Friday, it was decided that all evacuees would be told at the arrival area baggage carousel that they would have to book a paid quarantine unit. “It’s only after they book a paid facility that they will get customs clearance. Then they will be taken to the arrival lounge in groups of 20. If they refuse to go to a quarantine centre, police will take them there,” a government official said. Domestic flights
Mamata said domestic flights from cities with a large number of Covid-19 cases would not be allowed. “We had detected a few days ago that a Covid patient from Chennai (had flown to Calcutta). He boarded the flight with Covid documents in his pocket. No test, no check-up,” she said.
“So, we are saying flights from those places where the number of Corona cases is very high should not come till July 1,” she said.
Mamata said she had no problems with domestic flights operating within Bengal. “I have no problem and domestic flights can operate once in 15 days. We will get tests done following the protocol.”",states
Rivers swell and erode banks in rains," Incessant showers across north Bengal since Thursday evening led to flood-like situations in some areas of Cooch Behar and Malda districts where rivers and streams swelled and started gobbling land along the banks.
In 24 hours till 8.30am on Friday, the region received over 70mm of rainfall and some areas like Tufanganj in Cooch Behar recorded as high as 324mm of rain.
Weather experts, who had earlier forecast such a wet spell, said there was a red alert of rainfall of 200mm and above in five districts of north Bengal for the next two days.
“The monsoon trough is steadily hovering over north Bengal and hence, there will be little change in weather conditions in the next couple of days. We anticipate very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in sub-Himalayan districts of the region,” said a source in the Regional Met Office in Gangtok.
In Cooch Behar, the Bura Dharala river has started eroding the banks at Boalmari and some other adjoining villages in the Dinhata 1 block. “The river has swollen and taken away around 100 bighas of land and some houses. We have informed the block administration and want a temporary embankment of boulders in the area or else, the entire village might be washed away,” said Ekramul Haque, the pradhan of Petla panchayat under which Boalmari is located.

In a similar manner, rivers like Giridhari and Dharala were eating away land along the course at Daribash and Jari-Dharala villages which are in the same block and close to the India-Bangladesh border.
“We apprehend some low lying areas would be flooded soon. We have only one flood shelter for the two villages where 150 persons can stay whereas the total number of residents are around 4,000,” said a local resident.
According to IMD sources, it rained 135mm in Mathabhanga, 98.2 in Cooch Behar, 154.2mm in Mekhliganj and 77.2mm in Dinhata. The Cooch Behar district administration has opened up a round-the-clock control room. “Flood shelters and relief stocks have been assessed and are ready in case of evacuation anywhere. Sensitisation is going on in low lying areas of the river banks and in unprotected areas,” Cooch Behar district magistrate Pawan Kadyan said.
In Malda, water level of rivers like Ganga, Mahananda and Fulhar have increased. These rivers are flowing a little below the danger level, said Rajarshi Chakraborty, the DM.
He has asked the officials to prepare a database of the materials and equipment necessary to combat the flood. At the same time, the district administration is monitoring the rainfall in Nepal and Uttar Pradesh, which may contribute to the rise in water levels of the rivers.
The situation has also made the administration scout for flood shelters.
“It is not that we need to shift people immediately but the forecast issued by the weather office indicates there would be more rainfall in the coming days which can lead to inundation of some areas. That is why we are identifying flood shelters,” said a source in the administration.
However, this year, the administration is faced with a new problem. Schools, community halls and similar buildings — which are used as flood shelters — are converted into quarantine centres for suspected corona patients.
“If there is a flood, the affected would be shifted elsewhere and the flood centres would be used for the right purpose after proper sanitisation,” said Ashok Modak, additional district magistrate (general), Malda.",states
Lockdown in Guwahati," The Assam government has announced a 14-day “total lockdown” in Guwahati from Sunday midnight following a spurt in Covid-19 cases.
Night curfew was also imposed from 7pm to 7am across Assam from Friday evening and there will be “total lockdown” on weekends in town and municipal areas.
State health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced the decision on Friday after a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday night to take stock of the situation. The meeting was attended by Sarma and the chief secretary, among others.
Sarma said the government had no option but to announce the lockdown in Kamrup (metro) district, under which Guwahati falls, because of the sharp spike in cases. Except pharmacies and hospitals, everything else will remain closed, he said.
“Of the 762 positive cases detected in the city since June 15, 676 had no travel history. Almost 50 per cent cases reported in Assam over the past few days are from the city. People are not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing in busy areas. Residents have two days to buy essentials. We had to resort to the lockdown to save the city, the state and the Northeast,” Sarma said.
The announcement was followed by a run on the markets where social distancing norms were violated. The price of a kilo of potato rose from Rs 30 to Rs 40 in an hour.
Guwahati, considered the commercial hub and the gateway to the Northeast, has to be secured to check the spread, officials said. There has been a sharp rise in coronavirus cases since migrant workers and stranded people started returning home in May.
There are 9,592 cases in the region so far. Assam tops the list with 6,646 cases, followed by Tripura (1,259), Manipur (970), Nagaland (371), Arunachal (158), Mizoram (142), and Meghalaya (46). Twelve patients have died with Assam accounting for nine deaths and one each in Meghalaya, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh.
Assam is also battling the annual floods which have affected over 10 districts and left four dead so far.",states
Caution on drug abuse signs," Drug abuse among adolescents is going up but parents and teachers can help curb the menace by becoming watchful and being role models, experts said at a webinar on Friday.
Psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers attended the webinar organised by the Jharkhand government in association with Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Ranchi, on the occasion of International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.
The General Assembly of the United Nations had resolved in December 1987 to observe the day on June 26 every year to strengthen action and cooperation to achieve the goal of an international society free of drug abuse.
“Parents should watch out if their children suddenly exhibit behavioural changes like mood swings, being lethargic, avoiding eye contact or becoming defiant and hostile,” said Dr Nishant Goyal, associate professor at CIP.
He said those may be early signs of drug addiction.

“Starting from around 12 years when they start using tobacco or drinking alcohol more as a fun activity, some of these adolescents could become addicts by 18,” he said.
Citing a recent national drug use survey in which CIP Ranchi was the nodal agency for eastern India, Goyal said, “Around 68 per cent of senior high school students do not view regular marijuana use as harmful and 35 per cent had it at least once in the past one year. Besides, 50 per cent felt it was not harmful to try out drugs or cocaine once or twice.”
“Fifty per cent of them start indulging in ‘substance abuse to have fun’,” the psychiatrist said.
He said the survey found that others indulged in substance abuse to relax (48 per cent), to feel good (45 per cent), to experiment (36 per cent) or to shrug off boredom (33 per cent).
“Prevalence rate of drug abuse among adolescents is surely increasing but parents and teachers can help check it,” said Dr Ranjit Kumar of Manasik Arogyashala, Gwalior.
“Parents should be vigilant and notice whenever there is something amiss about their children, whether they are boys or girls,” he said.
“Steps taken immediately after spotting early warning signs can help a lot in protecting such children from becoming drug addicts, he added.
“They begin with a small quantity and gradually increase the intake as their tolerance level goes up or they start using harder drugs,” said Dr C.R.J. Khess, CIP professor in-charge of de-addiction services.
CIP director Dr D. Ram opened the webinar.
Other participants included Dr L.R. Pathak, nodal officer of National Health Mission in Jharkhand, besides doctors Shanta Kumari, Sanjay Kumar Munda and Deepak Giri.",states
Covid-19 halt at coal mine," Underground colliery operation at Jamadoba under Tata Steel’s Jharia division in Dhanbad, around 145km northeast of Jharkhand capital Ranchi, has been closed for sanitisation after a middle-aged senior officer tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday night at Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur.
Sources in the Jamadoba collieries said the 47-year–old officer had no travel history and was having fever and chest congestion for a few days.
“The official was having fever and chest congestion since June 18 but was reporting to duty. On June 22, he went for check-up at the Jamadoba hospital. The doctor referred him to Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur for Covid-19 test. The report came positive yesterday night,” said the source.
Tata Steel spokesperson, Runa Rajeev Kumar confirmed the temporary suspension of colliery operation at Jamadoba.
“One of our employees from Jharia division at Jamadoba collieries has been tested positive for Covid-19 and as per the guidelines mandated by the health ministry we started the disinfection and sanitization of the areas in and around Jamadoba colliery, where the employee was posted and working. The colliery is temporarily closed for at least two days,” said the company spokesperson.
The spokesperson further said that all contact tracing procedures have been followed and colleagues and other stakeholders who had interacted with the person have been quarantined and being tested as per procedure. No further symptoms or incidents have been reported. The condition of the positive employee is stable.
Significantly, the Jharia division of Tata Steel primarily comprises underground collieries divided into Sijua and Jamadoba collieries and supplies steel grade coal for Tata Steel plant at Jamshedpur.
“The Jamadoba colliery has nearly 600 employees with a production capacity of 0.34 Metric Ton per annum. The two-day closures of the mines would not have much impact on the steel production of the leading steel producer in Asia,” added a company official preferring anonymity.",states
Lockdown extended in Jharkhand till July 31," The Jharkhand government on Friday announced extension of the lockdown in the state by another month till July 31 as part of which relaxations given so far will remain in place but crowding at events like religious congregations and places such as malls will continue to remain suspended.
Chief secretary Sukhdev Singh late on Friday notified the orders, which read: “(The) lockdown in view of Covid-19 is extended till July 31 and all state departments and districts concerned are directed to strictly implement prescribed restrictions and advisories issued in the past.”
Chief minister Hemant Soren too announced it via his official Twitter handle. He tweeted: “We have received full support from public in our fight against Covid-19 so far; however, the fight is still unfinished. Considering the sensitivity of the situation, the state government has extended the lockdown till July 31. Relaxations given earlier will remain unchanged.”
As part of Unlock 1.0 since June 1, the Hemant government has offered relaxations in instalments by opening a slew of business establishments, intra-state mobility through cabs, ending the e-pass rule for inter-state movement and resumption of sporting arenas without spectators, among few other measures.
However, religious ceremonies, large weddings and sociopolitical-cultural programmes will continue to remain suspended till at least July 31. Similarly, schools, lodges, hostels, restaurants (dine-in), malls, cinemas and public transport (buses) will also be closed.

A senior official of the state disaster management department said safety protocols for the public, workplaces and business establishments will have to be strictly followed.
He said: “Masks will continue to be mandatory in public places; maintaining social distancing, ban on spitting in public places, restricted workforce at offices are a few key things we shall now strictly monitor.”
He added that although in the last couple of days, reports of Covid-19 cases have declined compared to over a week ago, it will still take some time for a clear-cut trend to be established.
“A few districts like Deoghar and Bokaro, which became Covid free, reported fresh cases recently. So, the government wants to exercise extra caution before completely doing away with the lockdown. Though the influx of migrant workers is down to a trickle now, there is still some floating crowd moving within the state which needs to be stabilised.”
Till Friday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Jharkhand stood at 2,294, of which 1,647 have recovered and 635 are active cases, besides 12 deaths.",states
"Fire revisits Nandaram Market, 11 years on"," A fire broke out inside a readymade garments godown on the ninth floor of Nandaram Market on Saturday, re-igniting memories of a 100-hour inferno at Calcutta’s biggest wholesale trading hub 11 years ago.
It took eight fire tenders to bring the blaze under control as innumerable traders from the 13-storey Nandaram Market and adjoining Burrabazar markets like Raja Katra, Tripal Patti and Monahardas Katra gathered in the shadows, panic writ large on their faces.
Till late at night it was not clear what caused the fire. Firefighters said they suspected a short circuit had sparked the blaze. Bundles of readymade garments stacked inside the 300sqft godown went up in flames after an electrical spark apparently fell on one of them, eyewitnesses said.
Police, firefighters and members of the disaster management team said the location of the building, in the middle of a bustling market, made it difficult to tackle the blaze.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM None was trapped or injured. Traders said they were yet to assess the extent of the damage cause by the fire, which began around 3pm.
“The collapsible gates of the godown were locked. The lone staff member of the godown had just left for lunch when the fire broke out,” said Prakitish Chaudhury, a trader dealing in plastic bags, who was present on the floor when the fire began.
“We immediately called our staff, broke open the gates and tried to douse the flames with water,” he added.
The police are yet to identify the godown owner. A section of traders claimed that one Naresh Gupta owned the godown. Gupta has been a player in the market for a long time, the traders said, and was not around when the fire broke out.
Flames started leaping out of the window of the ninth-floor godown as traders ran out of the building, some taking along their books of account and others with almirahs and lockers. There are around 4,000 shops and godowns in Nandaram Market, which had been at the centre of a tug of war for years since the January 2008 fire. The fire department had refused to allow the market to open, while the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had faced pressure to issue fresh trade licences.
In 2013, the market re-opened after the fire department ensured that some of its safety recommendations, including a water reservoir with a hydrant system and sprinklers, were in place.
On Saturday, some traders said the fire-fighting system worked for sometime with pipes carrying water from the reservoir on the terrace through hydrants, but the flow was weak. “After the CESC snapped the power supply, the flow of water was disrupted because the pumps stopped functioning,” said Manik Sethia, a trader.
The fire engines initially faced difficulty in carrying water pipes to the ninth-floor godown. Later, generators were used to restart the reservoir pumps. A sky-lift, which could reach a height of 55 metres, was brought in. But with no space to manoeuvre and a mesh of cables hanging in the air, the lift couldn’t be operated.
“I came down with my book of accounts. It brought back memories of the 2008 fire,” said Raj Purohit, one of the traders.
Police officers said forensic experts would reach the spot on Sunday and collect samples. “We will later check if the fire-fighting system had worked,” said Sujit Bose, the fire and emergency services minister, who visited Nandaram Market.",states
AASU slams Sonowal on citizen bill," The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) on Sunday slammed Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal for not opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill like his Meghalaya and Nagaland counterparts.
“The chief ministers of neighbouring states like Meghalaya and Nagaland oppose the bill though these states enjoy special status. But the Assam chief minister is silent,” said AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi.
He said AASU leaders will meet Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the bill and convey their “strong” opposition.
Shah is holding rounds of meetings with political and apolitical organisations from the Northeast on the bill before tabling it in Parliament.
The Northeast had witnessed a series of protests last year against the bill.
The AASU and other constituent organisations of the North East Students’ Organisations (Neso) had spearheaded the movement across the region.
“If the Centre is thinking that it will be able to put the burden of illegal foreigners on us through the bill while offering implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord then it is wrong. We will not accept the bill,” said the general secretary. He added that the bill is unconstitutional and violates the secular character of the Constitution and the Assam Accord.
On the other hand, the students of Dibrugarh University in Upper Assam also joined the protests on Sunday.
The students organised a protest and announced that they would not allow the political leaders supporting the bill to enter the university. On Saturday, students of Gauhati University and Cotton University hit the streets against the bill.
The students of Cotton University on Sunday protested in front of the head office of the AGP at Ambari here to vent their ire on the alleged indirect support by the regional party to the bill.
They burnt effigies of AGP leaders, including its president Atul Bora.
“Through this protest we are warning the AGP leaders to be with the people of Assam. Otherwise, the people will give them a fitting reply,” said a protester. The protesters also met Assam PCC president Ripun Bora and leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia to voice their opposition to the bill.
Duliajan rally
AASU’s Duliajan unit also took out a bike rally on Sunday in protest against the citizenship bill. The protesters took part in the rally as part of the joint protests with 30 other organizations against the bill in the state.

Voices many against child labour," To raise voice against child labour, over 300 school-going slumkids and youths, under the banner of city-based social outfit Adarsh Seva Sansthan, took part in a three-day awareness drive, which kicked off on Wednesday.
On the first day, boys and girls above 18 years of age from 23 slums across the steel city participated in a nukkad natak highlighting the perils of child labour and spreading the word on the importance of education.
The children performed the street play at several villages, including Birsa Basti in Sonari, Sido Kanhu Basti, Beldihgram Basti, New Kapali Basti, Balram Basti and Bachcha Singh Basti. Children below 18 years also took out a rally.
“Mahina me hazaar rupaiya ke liye kuch bachhe kaam karte hai. Isiliye koshish yahi hai ki unhe school pahunchaya jaye (Some children work for a meagre amount of Rs 1,000. So our main effort in to induct these kids into schools),” said Class V student of Nav Prathamik Vidyalaya, Sido Kanhu Basti, Ganesh Sardar who is part of the campaign.
His friend Srivastav Ghunia further wishes for a child labour-free society. “We should study and focus on our future rather than spoiling our childhood. I love going to school and want children of my age to also be properly educated,” said Srivastav.
According to Usha Mahto, one of co-ordinators of the programme, 30 out of 135 child labourers have been rescued and then admitted to schools in the last one year. “Our main purpose is to make these children and their parents understand the importance of education. Sometimes it becomes really difficult as for them money is more than going to school. We plan to spread our drive in seven more slums,” added Mahto.
Adarsh Seva Sansthan will also host a meeting in Sakchi on Thursday to connect with other social outfits working in the field of child rights. The programme to be organised by Childline will be attended by members of 30 city-based NGOs. ",states
"Traffic drive yields Rs 30,000 in fines"," The traffic wing of East Singhbhum police launched a surprise checking drive in various parts of the steel city and collected around Rs 30,000 as fines on Wednesday.
The drive was launched simultaneously across four traffic police stations — Sakchi, Bistupur, Jugsalai and Mango.
During the crackdown, which started at 11 in the morning and continued for two hours, around 100 bikers and 40 motorists were caught flouting rules like riding without helmets or valid documents.
Helmet-less bikers had to pay Rs 270 as penalty. Driving without a licence invited a penalty of Rs 500 and missing insurance papers cost a biker or motorist Rs 1,000.
Bikers caught with number plates on the front had to shell out Rs 300.
DSP (traffic) Shivendra Kumar said such a drive would continue.
“It was conducted to make people as well as picnickers aware of the importance of traffic rules. Apart from generating revenue for the department, such drives also help instil discipline among people, especially youngsters,” he said.
Incidentally, rash and helmet-less driving witness a rise during the picnic season. Sources said special instructions had been given to all traffic police posts across the city to carry out surprise checking drives.",states
"Ranchi, Jamshedpur zoos on bird flu alert"," Bird flu confirmation in the death of six peacocks at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna, Bihar, has prompted authorities at Birsa zoo in Ormanjhi, 20km from here, to step up vigil against the H5N1 virus responsible for avian influenza.
Veterinarian Ajay Kumar said they were sprinkling hydrated lime (chemically calcium hydroxide) and spraying herbal disinfectants as precautionary measures.
“We have 600 birds of various species, and all are safe as of now. But, we are not going to risk a chance. Besides disinfecting the aviary premises, we are assessing health of inmates on a regular basis,” Kumar said, adding that he had doubled the frequency of his visits.
The Patna zoo was closed to visitors from Tuesday, a day after the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal determined avian influenza in the samples of peacocks sent. The dead birds have been buried and the remaining ones quarantined.
According to the Birsa zoo vet, they have been on alert since suspicions of bird flu surfaced at Patna zoo around last Thursday. Earlier, he visited the aviary once a day. Now, he visits twice.

“Hydrated lime, also called slaked lime, is a good chemical disinfectant. It is being sprinkled on walkways accessible to zoo visitors. The herbal disinfectant, on the other hand, is being used inside enclosures where visitors cannot go. Earlier, disinfectants were used once a week. Since December 20, they are being sprinkled and sprayed every alternate day,” Kumar said.
The vet has tweaked the avian diet plan too. “We have started giving vitamins A, D3 and E, besides immune modulators. Immune modulation is more than just boosting the body’s immunity. It involves bringing the ratio of different immune cells back into balance to enable the immune system to function correctly,” he explained.
Tata zoo in Jamshedpur on Wednesday launched preventive care for animals in the wake of the bird flu.
Zoo deputy director and vet Manik Palit said they usually took disease preventive measures from time to time, but had started giving boiled chicken to carnivores as a precautionary measure.
This is the first incidence of bird flu at Patna zoo. Government guidelines designate any area within a kilometre’s radius from the bird flu site as “infected zone” while the stretch between 1km and 10km is marked as “surveillance zone”.
The 153-acre Patna zoo shares its boundary with the Raj Bhavan. It is also located across the road from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s 1 Aney Marg official residence, besides being close to the airport.",states
Need a garbage collector? Call this Tinsukia minor," A 12-year-old boy has been hired at Rs 1,500 per month for door-to-door garbage collection by a NGO in partnership with the Tinsukia Municipal Board in various wards here.
“I am 12 and I come with a vehicle to collect garbage from door-to-door. I get Rs 1,500 per month,” Vikash told The Telegraph while collecting garbage from a lane in ward 6 here on Wednesday.
When contacted, the chairperson of Tinsukia Municipal Board, Dipti Das, said, “There is no information of any minor being engaged in garbage collection work. The project is being implemented by an NGO, Care Northeast Foundation, on a pilot-project basis.”
“The supervisor is the owner and he pays us,” said Raju, who got down from the garbage-collecting vehicle, very reluctant to divulge their names. On further questioning, Raju named an employee of the Tinsukia Municipal Board, identifying him as the owner of the vehicle and supervisor, who got him this work and pays him.
“We move out at 7am and collect garbage till 1pm,” he added.

Tinsukia Municipal Board junior engineer Nabojyoti Das said, “According to our official records, there is no minor engaged in door-to-door garbage collection. Half of workers are from the municipal board and we pay them. The remaining workers has been engaged by the NGO and we do not pay these workers directly,” Das added. Refuting the allegations, the director of Care Northeast Foundation, Sanjay Kumar Gupta, said, “I am working with a child rights organisation for past 17 years and there is no question of hiring a minor for garbage collection.”
“We roll out 16 vehicles to cover 10 of 15 wards. Each vehicle has a supervisor, two workers besides a driver. Fifty per cent of the workers are under Tinsukia Municipal Board and are paid by it. The remaining workers are on the muster roll of civic body and we pay them at approved rates by the civic body on monthly basis,” said Gupta. “Bio-data of all the workers are with civic body.”
“This is a pilot-project rolled out in July in partnership with civic body for Rs 111,000 per ward per month. However, the civic body has only paid us for the month of July after deducting Rs 128,000,” Gupta alleged.

2 filmmakers feted at IFFI," Two filmmakers from the Northeast were feted at the closing ceremony of the 50th International Film Festival India (IFFI) in Goa recently.
Assam’s Manju Borah and Manipur’s Haobam Paban Kumar, alongside some legends, were felicitated for their contribution to the Indian cinema.
Borah’s film Land of the Poisoned Women was screened at the Indian Panorama, a flagship section of the IFFI that showcases the best of contemporary Indian works, along with two other films from the region — Pradip Kurbah’s Iewduh and Utpal Datta’s Bohubritta. “It is an honour to be felicitated alongside Ilayaraja, Birju Maharaj, Prem Chopra and other big names at the IFFI. Now I am more motivated to continue my filmmaking journey,” Borah told The Telegraph.
So far, she has made 11 feature films and won nine National Awards as a director and a producer. Land of the Poisoned Women in Pangchenpa dialect is based in Arunachal Pradesh. The film depicts the story of a superstition in the Pangchenpa community that women have poison in their nails and men die slowly or immediately after being served food by women. The film sheds light on how the modern educated generation is trying to eradicate the superstition.
Kumar has dealt with some crucial issues, from human rights to environment degradation. “It’s a huge honour to be counted among the best,” he said. Kumar’s debut feature film Loktak Lairembee (Lady of the Lake) won the National Award for Best Film on Environment Conservation/ Preservation at the 64th National Film Awards 2016. Six of his films have been screened at different editions of the IFFI over the years. Among others, his documentary AFSPA 1958 turned out to be one of the highly critical and widely appreciated films in 2006. The documentary depicts the harsh reality of the ill-effects of the Arms Forces (Special Powers) Act in Manipur.",states
Insurgency situations vary in states: Gogoi," Former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on Saturday said insurgencies in different northeastern states have to be dealt with differently, on a case-by-case basis.
Gogoi was speaking at a youth conclave, organised by Inside NE, a Guwahati-based online news portal, here.
The Congress veteran said the role of his (erstwhile) government was to bring the militants to the mainstream and not “finish them”. “The only way to finish insurgency in the state is by negotiating peace talks with them. There is no other alternative to finish insurgency in the region. We have to understand what route is better — democracy or armed,” he added.
Gogoi said the reasons and problems related to insurgency varied from place to place in the Northeast.
“Manipur’s problem is different, Nagaland’s problem is different, Assam’s problem is different and so on. You can’t have the same solution for all. We have to understand their problems and solve it in a democratic manner,” he said.

Manipur deputy chief minister Y. Joykumar Singh, who was on the panel, said subsequent governments at the Centre have never been able to understand the people of the Northeast and what they want. “Each and every insurgency situation in the Northeast is unique,” he said.
Gogoi, too, said central governments have failed to understand the problems of the Northeast. Economic development is the key to curb insurgency in the state, he said. “In my tenure, the slogan was development will come first, peace will follow. If there is proper infrastructure, connectivity, construction of roads and bridges, and job generation, then people’s attention will not be diverted and insurgency will be controlled,” Gogoi said.
When a student said that after 2014, it has become a trend for youths to join militancy, Gogoi said it was primarily because of lack of economic development in the region.
“The GDP should have risen. Instead, it has plunged to 4.5 per cent…youths are unemployed. We have to provide youths with employment opportunities, develop education infrastructure in the state,” he said. If these basic issues are not resolved, insurgency might spread like wildfire, he warned.",states
107 witch-hunt deaths in 8 years: Government,"  Nearly 107 people have been killed in witch-hunting incidents in Assam since 2011, parliamentary affairs Chandra Mohan Patowary told the Assembly on Saturday during a discussion on various issues related to the home department.
Patowary was replying on behalf of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who holds the home portfolio.
In February this year, Nirjoy Rabha, 50, of Kokrajhar district in lower Assam, died after a mob thrashed him after branding him a “sorcerer”. The attackers believed he was the reason behind a deadly fever spreading in the village.
A man was arrested in September for allegedly killing two women in another case of witch-hunting in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district.
“Between 2011 and May 2016, before the BJP-led government came to power in the state, around 84 people were killed in witch-hunting incidents. From June 2016 till October this year, at least 23 more were killed in similar incidents,” Patowary said, while replying to a written question by Congress legislator Nandita Das.

Out of the 23 people killed during the BJP-led government’s tenure, 12 were men and 11 women.
The official report said witch-hunting cases were recorded in at least 21 districts of the state. However, the maximum number of such cases were reported from the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD), which comprises Kokrajhar, Baksa, Udalguri and Chirang districts.
“Lower Assam’s Kokrajhar district registered the highest number of witch-hunting cases, with 22 people killed in such incidents, from 2011 to October this year. Neighbouring Chirang registered the second highest (19) witch-hunting cases during the same period,” the report said.
While Udalguri district recorded 11 witch-hunting deaths, Baksa registered two during the same period. However, in both these districts, the incidents occurred before the BJP came to power in the state.
Nagaon, Tinsukia, Goalpara, Biswanath and Karbi Anglong districts also registered witch-hunting cases.
Patowary said the state government had notified the Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act, 2015, in October last year and has been carrying out awareness drives against superstitious beliefs.",states
Negligence finger at hospital for vision loss," A 23-year-old youth lost one of his eyes because doctors at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital did not pull out an iron nail stuck in the eye for two days, his family has alleged.
Raja Naskar, a resident of Baruipur in South 24-Parganas, was admitted to the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology at the hospital on November 25 after he injured one of his eyes while working at a press in Sealdah.
Naskar’s family has said they did not know if something was stuck in his eye when they took him to the hospital; only that something had hit him in the eye while cutting an inch-long nail into two.
Doctors attending to Naskar apparently bandaged the injured eye and stitched the eyelids before admitting him to the male ward.
Two days later, doctors said his eye needed to be operated on, according to his family. They took the family’s consent on a printed form.

On Friday, he was operated on and doctors pulled out a part of an iron nail from his eye and told the family he had lost vision in the eye.
On Saturday, Naskar’s father Janenjay Naskar lodged a complaint in writing with Ashim Kumar Ghosh, the director of RIO, asking why doctors had not told the family a nail was stuck in his son’s eye.
He alleged doctors had not diagnosed the matter in time and that led to his son’s loss of vision in the eye.
Ghosh said Naskar’s eye had developed an infection and it was “unfortunate” that he lost one of his eyes. “We have set up a committee to find out if there was any negligence on the part of doctors or anyone,” he said.",states
Biomining at Dhapa to free up space," The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will mine the 35-metre tall mound of garbage at Dhapa and recover recyclable items from it, a process known as biomining, mayor Firhad Hakim said on Saturday.
The recovered waste will be sent to recycling units to reduce the volume of waste lying at Dhapa and create new space at the site that is overflowing with city's waste.
The CMC has been on the lookout for a new plot for many years but is yet to get hold of any.
There is no new land to dump the city’s daily waste and the CMC was worried where to dump the waste in a few years from now. A CMC engineer said that biomining would help them reclaim the land that now looks out of use.
“We are introducing bio-mining at Dhapa,” Hakim said on Saturday. The mayor, who is also the urban development minister, said the waste management model would be replicated across the state.

“The site at Dhapa where wastes are still dumped is about 60 acres. The accumulation of wastes over the years has made the mounds nearly 35-metres high, which is equal to the height of a 10-storey building, and there is hardly any space for dumping waste. We need new land but that is hardly available,” said an engineer.
An engineer of the civic body said that they had already floated a tender inviting expert companies to do the work. “Under the project, plastic, soil and construction waste will be segregated. Each of these will be sent to recycling plants where they will undergo processing and made fit for reuse,” said the engineer.
Ayan Majumder, a waste management specialist who is advising the state government on similar bio-mining projects elsewhere, said construction and demolition waste could be processed and paver blocks or bricks made from them. The plastic waste can is used in the cement industry, he added.
“In biomining, the legacy waste is screened and its various varieties recycled for new use,” he said. CMC officials said with the removal of legacy waste from Dhapa, free space would be available for use.
But indiscriminate dumping of waste on the recovered land would again give rise to the same problem after a decade or two.
“The CMC is simultaneously looking for agencies to who will build recycling units at Dhapa where the new waste that is coming can be recycled,” he said.
This will naturally extend the life of the waste-dumping site.
Waste management specialists said that across the world recycling and reprocessing of waste is being implemented to deal with the land scarcity challenge.
But the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has an uphill task of introducing waste segregation at source throughout the city. Segregation at source is being done in only 27 of 144 wards managed by CMC.",states
Union ministers drum up support in Kolhan," The campaign spotlight on Saturday shifted to Kolhan division where the second phase of voting is scheduled on December 7.
Union steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan addressed rallies at Chakradhapur for BJP state president Laxman Giluwa and at Jagannathpur in West Singhbhum for Sudhir Kumar Sundi. Union textile minister Smriti Irani canvassed at Chakulia (in Baharagora constituency) for Kunal Sarangi and at Moubhandar (in Ghatshila constituency) for Lakhan Mardi in East Singhbhum.
JMM executive president Hemant Soren also addressed a rally in Manoharpur constituency to drum up support for Joba Majhi.
Seeking votes for Giluwa at Chainpur grounds in Chakradharpur, Prasad said: “We are going to form the government in the state and if you elect Giluwa, the party would give him a responsible position in the state cabinet, which would usher in development in the region.”
At the rally at Jaintgarh in Jagannathpur constituency, Pradhan accused the JMM and Congress governments of looting iron ore mines in Noamundi without carrying out development in the region. “We are planning to revive the closed mines and provide employment to the local people,” he said. At Chakulia, Smriti Irani highlighted the success of the Raghubar Das government in implementing the central government schemes. “However, Opposition parties blinded by corruption are not able to see the development,” she said.
At Moubhandar grounds in Ghatshila, Irani said the construction of toilets had brought respite to nearly 11 crore women. “Our government has given a swastha (healthy) and swachh (clean) India. I would request you to vote for the lotus as goddess Laxmi comes on lotus, but never carries a bow and arrow (the JMM symbol),” she said.
BJP’s Lakhan Mardi is locked in a triangular fight with JMM’s Ramdas Soren and Ajsu’s Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu in Ghatshila.
Irani also campaigned for party candidate Sadhu Charan Mahto at Nimdih in Ichagarh constituency.
Addressing the rally in Manoharpur constituency, Hemant took a dig at the BJP’s double-engine government.
“There is only engine and no bogie for the poor people of Jharkhand. Crores were spent on overseas tours and Momentum Jharkhand, but nothing was done to improve the lives of the people,” Hemant said. ",states
War rooms buzz as poll battle begins," The BJP headquarters in the capital’s Harmu has a call centre. The Congress was constantly monitoring its Shakti app. JVM leader Babulal Marandi, Ajsu Party chief Sudeh Mahto and JMM working president Hemant Soren were taking feedback from ground-level workers.
The war rooms of the political parties were buzzing with activity with the elections getting underway.
“Our general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh, besides senior party leaders Om Prakash Mathur and Ramlal, are monitoring everything,” said a senior state BJP leader involved in backroom strategy. “They are being helped by senior leaders of the party. Our workers on the ground are engaged in the polling and they regularly pass information. Besides, in every constituency we have deployed some people without disclosing their identity to local cadres who also update us about the emerging polling and election scenario.”
The BJP juggernaut has an edge in terms of real-time planning and communication with workers at the booth level. During formation of the booth-level committees, all workers’ mobile numbers and other details were taken, pointed out the leader.
“So we had the benefit of contacting them to get actual status of polling and mood of people,” he said. “Today also back to back meetings were held on information we were getting from the ground and necessary directions were given. The chief Minister is also keeping tabs. Ahead of the polling party workers at the booth level were asked to call and contact voters to ensure that they vote. We know about the pockets where we are strong and weak.”
JVM president Babulal Marandi, who campaigned in Assembly constituencies under Hazaribagh district on Saturday, is the lone fighter and strategist of his party.
“Our small office at Kadru in Ranchi serves as the war room,” said Tauhid Alam, media in-charge of the JVM. “Marandiji in consultation with us decides what to do next. We are focusing on media and ground management. Some of the leaders who are good speakers have been asked to join panel debates on news channels. We don’t have logistics and infrastructure like the BJP but we have cadres who are committed for the party and Marandiji. We will the change dynamics of state politics.”
The Congress too has an active war room at the party office in Ranchi where state in-charge RPN Singh was monitoring the ongoing election.
“Recently, we had launched Shakti app for membership drive, which is one of the best and most powerful weapons for us to know about our supporters and workers at the micro level,” said a senior state Congress leader. “Ten dedicated party workers constantly call polling workers at the booth level. We have a list of people who hold influence in their pockets; we remain in touch with them. Besides, we had prepared a list of people within the BJP, our rival camp, who are annoyed with the candidate of their party. This is our secret game plan.”
The leader claimed that as per the ground reports he had got, the BJP would only win Panki and Bhawanathpur among the 13 seats that voted on Saturday.
“We are very keen about the outcome of Lohardaga seat where our former party president Sukhdeo Bhagat is contesting as the BJP nominee against our state party president Rameshwar Oraon,” the Congress leader said. “We are thankful to Union minister Amit Shah whose statement that he considers the Ajsu Party as part of the NDA alliance has consolidated Muslim voters in our favour. During election rally Bhagat touched the feet of Shah on the stage. Muslims can forgive Narendra Modi and Raghubar Das but not Shah. Bhagat has support base among Muslims but they hardly voted for him. Sarna votes were divided among the BJP, Congress and Ajsu Party whereas we got votes of Sadan, Christian and Muslim voters.”
At the Ajsu Party war room, near the BJP HQ in Harmu, party president Sudesh Mahto was taking feedback from workers.
“Shah tried to create confusion in the minds of the people by saying that we (Ajsu) will ultimately stay in alliance with the BJP. We quickly rebutted this speculation. We have a very positive feedback about the party for the first phase,” said a party worker.
Former chief minister and JMM working president Hemant Soren was campaigning in Kolhan division along with party general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.
“We were taking feedback over phone,” said Bhattacharya. “We are very confident that the UPA (Congress-JMM-RJD) will win at least 10 seats. The countdown of the BJP (exit) has started.”",states
Ranchi civic body pats itself on the back," Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) has rated its cleanliness service three stars in an internal assessment ahead of Swachh Survekshan in January.
The civic body defended the three-star rating by claiming that garbage was collected every day from 90 per cent of the houses in 53 wards under the corporation.
However, a survey by The Telegraph revealed that the rating was not justified.
Garbage dumps along roads and in street corners pointed out that the civic body had a lot to improve as far as cleanliness was concerned.
Sanjay Minz, a resident of Pipartoli under Ward 35, said garbage was not collected from his locality regularly despite several requests.

“We have to dump trash in open fields and isolated places,” Minz said.
Abhay Kumar, a resident of Ganga Nagar in Ward 34, supported Minz.
“Garbage collection vehicles come to my house after a gap of 5-15 days. Trash keeps piling up in our homes because our locality is congested and there are no open space to dispose of the waste,” Kumar said.
A resident of Peace Road under Ward 10, Avinash Jaiswal, said trash strewn on the road was a common sight at Sadbhavna Nagar.
“People dump garbage on vacant plots of land from where RMC collects it once in two months,” Jaiswal said.
Municipal commissioner Manoj Kumar said the rating was an internal assessment to prepare for the pan-India cleanliness survey expected in January next year.
“I have asked people to send their suggestions to improve the system,” he said.
On how the civic body came to the conclusion that garbage was collected from 90 per cent of the houses, Kumar said: “The total weight of the garbage helped us form an estimate. A survey on whether the trash is collected from garbage points or from houses will help us arrive at a more specific figure.”
Health officer Dr Kiran Kumari said she had not received any formal objection regarding the rating.",states
Alliance ball in Ajsu court," Bihar minister Nand Kishore Yadav, who is also the BJP’s co-in-charge for the Jharkhand Assembly election, on Friday said that the saffron party still considers the Ajsu Party as an ally.
“At the Centre the BJP has majority but we have our alliance partners in the government also. It is for the Ajsu Party to decide whether it wants to be our alliance partner or not,” Nand Kishore said at a news meet here.
Union home minister Amit Shah had also said on Thursday that the BJP considers the Ajsu Party as an ally.
Nand Kishore alleged that the JMM-led Opposition alliance was a divided house.
“The JMM, Congress and RJD have not released their joint manifesto because there are contradictions among the alliance partners. Left-wing extremism lost its ground in Jharkhand in the last five years, but the UPA partners are silent,” he said.

He claimed that CM Das’s government had fulfilled 92 per cent of the promises the party had made in its 2014 Assembly poll manifesto, according to a research group called Lokniti.
“We don’t make tall claims. We promise what we can do. There are many smaller parties contesting a handful of seats; they make promises as if they are in a position to form the government,” he said.
He said the Congress had no moral ground to speak against corruption.
The BJP also demanded that JMM working president Hemant Soren, the chief minisetrial face of the Opposition alliance, come clean on the allegation levelled by Shashibhushan Samad, the JMM MLA from Chakradharpur.
Samad is contesting from the seat as the JVM candidate after the JMM denied him the ticket. The JMM has fielded Sukhram Oraon.
Samad claimed that Hemant “sold-off” the Chakradharpur seat for Rs 50 lakh and that the JMM leader took Rs 6 crore from Geeta Koda in exchange of the Chaibasa seat in the last parliamentary election.
“If the allegations are wrong then Hemant Soren must dare to lodge an FIR against him (Samad),” said state BJP spokesperson Pratul Nath Shahdeo. “The leadership of the JMM and the Congress are known for selling poll tickets. During the parliamentary election Congress’s sitting MLA Irfan Ansari had claimed that then party president Ajoy Kumar sold-off tickets. The JMM leadership always indulges in corruption right from mining scam to accepting money from the Congress to save the then Narsimha Rao government,”
The JMM spokesperson Vinod Pandey denied Samad’s slur. “He was denied the ticket owning to his poor personal and political conduct and there was poor feedback from the constituency. As far as his allegation is concerned, onlythe BJP takes him seriously,” Pandey said.",states
Career counselling camp shows kids the right path," She dreams of being an air hostess and flying around the world
He wants to join the police force but is clueless about the criteria
She wants to be a psychologist but has no one to guide her
The dreams of 100 children from various NGOs got wings at a career counselling event this Christmas season.
Select underprivileged students from classes VII to XI got a chance to listen to entrepreneurs, artistes and leaders from various fields, interact with career coaches and learn about vocational training courses available at The Pathway.
“Ten NGOs sent some of their best students for counselling,” said Kanishk Saraogi, a BCom third-year student of St Xavier’s College (Autonomous) and a core member of We Are One, a volunteer group that organised the event along with Yeh Mera India.
The volunteers at We Are One are mostly college students, who will turn buddies for the 100 kids and keep tabs on their academic progress.
“We have spread the word through the social media. We are inviting student volunteers to register as mentors. We will match a kid and his mentor according to their where they live,” Kanishk said.
“Most of these children want to change their lives and become economically independent. They are, however, clueless about how to chase their dreams. We will help them choose a career according to their aptitude and keep them posted on the opportunities available,” career coach Rachna Mimani, one of the counsellors at the event, said.
The children were shown audio and video clips on various career options, coached on opportunities in science and commerce streams and given training in yoga and dance therapy.
“I live in a shelter run by Loreto Rainbow Homes. I have an aunt and I want to give her a good life in future. I want to know how I can get a good teaching job in a school,” said Laboni Naskar of Diamond Harbour in between sessions.
Afreen Khatoon of Park Circus wants to change society. “I want to be a psychologist. I want to help people in trauma and in the throes of addiction, especially in my neighbourhood. But I have few people to advise me on what to do after school,” said the first-generation learner from EkTara whose father is a driver.
The students had to fill in a questionnaire where they were asked about their dreams and areas of interest. “The information will come in handy during the career counselling,” Kanishk said.
“Not all kids have to be good in academics. We will also help them enrol for vocational courses,” said Megha Podder of Yeh Mera India.
Jayanti Mondal, a resident of Salt Lake Gate No. I, loves to decorate her house. “I think I should study home science in college, but I am not sure. I don’t want to waste three years studying the wrong subject. This career counselling has come just in time,” said the mason’s daughter.
The kids also got a diary to jot down their academic dilemmas which the mentors will try to resolve.
Children came from CINI, Vivekananda Vidya Mandir, Big Little Leap and other NGOs.",states
"Jadavpur University VC thanks Governor for his help, and says Rowling is his source of solace"," Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, on Monday used what was possibly his last convocation speech to publicly thank the governor for helping him navigate through “trying circumstances” and quoted the author J.K. Rowling as his source of “solace” whenever he failed.
“I put on record my honest debt to you for your constant help in discharging my duties since I assumed office under trying circumstances, and I hope to receive your guidance during the remaining months of my tenure,” Das said, turning to governor and chancellor Keshari Nath Tripathi on the dais.
The retirement age for the vice-chancellor of a state university is 65 years. Das is six months away from turning 65.
Das became the vice-chancellor of JU in July 2015 after his predecessor, Abhijit Chakrabarti, was forced to quit in the wake of a four-and-a-half-month-long students’ agitation over police being called to the campus to end a gherao. He has himself faced several spells of student unrest since, the last one in early July almost making him quit.
“I feel that although I did my best to serve the cause of the university, I might not have been always successful. Nor did I satisfy all sections of the university community,” Das said at the convocation.
He said Rowling’s words — the celebrated author of the Harry Potter novels had a long period of personal and professional struggles — would keep him motivated whenever despair threatened to take over.
“It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all — in which case you fail by default,” Das said, quoting the British author.
Das spoke of dissent as a democratic weapon that should be used for the right reasons. “Of course universities should be sites for nourishing free thought and dissent. But surely dissent needs to be expressed in a democratic spirit, without vitiating a healthy culture of protest and violating the democratic rights of others,” he said.
In July, vice-chancellor Das and some of his colleagues had been gheraoed for 31 hours by students demanding restoration of admission tests for arts subjects. As the stalemate continued, a group of students started a fast-unto-death under the portico of Aurobindo Bhavan. When the students started taking ill, the executive council, the highest decision-making body of the university, forced vice-chancellor Das to accept the demand.
Tripathi appealed to the students to be “disciplined” and urged the university authorities to remain “alive” to the happenings on the campus. “To the students, I pray: be disciplined, be large-hearted, be systematic….The university administration should also have a straightforward approach to maintaining the academic atmosphere in this university. They must be alive to what is happening on the campus during and even after teaching hours,” he said.
Economist Kaushik Basu was conferred a DLitt (honoris causa) at the convocation. Dipankar Chatterji, a molecular biologist, and Mammen Chandy, the director of Tata Medical Center, were awarded a DSc (honoris causa).",states
"A decade later, this bridge is still in troubled waters"," At a time politicians are busy promising the moon to voters, the 1,433m Barbendia bridge on the Barakar river in Nirsa is a reminder of government apathy since August 2009, when the bridge’s pillars collapsed.
Ten years on, both Nirsa MCC MLA Arup Chatterjee and former state water resources minister Aparna Sengupta, who’s now with the BJP, are blaming each other.
A special division of the rural engineering organisation (REO) began work on the bridge on January 20, 2008. Work stopped on August 20, 2009, when two pillars caved in and two others bent.
Efforts to resume work on the bridge — that could have cut down the distance between Nirsa and Jamtara from 65km to 16km — came a cropper. Allegedly, government departments such as rural engineering organisation and road construction lacked coordination.
“The bridge would have proved convenient for a large number of pilgrims visiting Baidyanathdham in Deoghar from the across the state,” said Mugma, Nirsa resident Shashi Bhushan Tiwari, regional secretary of the Rashtriya Colliery Mazdoor Sangh. “It would have helped patients from Santhal Pargana, especially Jamtara, Sahebganj, Dumka and Pakur, to reach Dhanbad for affordable medical care at the state-run PMCH.”
He added that it was unbelievable that the bridge had not yet been built.
“What can I say except that it’s a glaring example of the indifference of successive governments to major infrastructure schemes, and a huge waste of public money.”
He said the government had to spend over Rs 2,000 crore on constructing the Sahebganj-Ranchi road. “Had the bridge been built, that expense might have been spared.”
Former water resources minister and BJP candidate from Nirsa Assembly seat Aparna Sengupta, under whose tenure as Forward Bloc Nirsa MLA work had begun, blamed the present MLA.
“Not just the Barbendia bridge, all government infrastructure schemes are in limbo due to the inaction of the present MLA Arup Chatterjee,” she fumed.
Chatterjee rejected Sengupta’s charges.
“I have repeatedly raised the issue (of the bridge) in the call attention motion (of the Assembly. It is due to my sustained efforts that the state has initiated the process to clear technical hurdles in bridge construction. Work is likely to resume after elections,” he said.
He claimed that the government had finally decided to make a new bridge through the road construction department. “But a no-objection certificate will have to be issued by the REO to the road construction department, because the new bridge will be built adjacent to the half-built bridge one whose pillars had fallen in 2009. The process of the NoC had moved forward but the model code of conduct came into force,” he said.
More than 10 years ago, a three-member government committee had found that the pillars collapsed as the foundation was not strong enough. Instead of piling 64.33 feet of steel frames beneath the pillars, the construction firm M/sGanesh Ram Dokania of Deoghar had put only 22 feet.

Tribal groups slam Centre," The Coordination Committee of Tribal Organisations of Assam, (CCTOA), an umbrella organisation of the state’s Scheduled Tribe communities on Friday said the Centre is “fooling the six communities demanding ST status in a trick to pass the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019”.
“The Centre tabled the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2019, in the Rajya Sabha on January 9 to grant Scheduled Tribe status to the Moran, Muttock, Tai Ahom, Koch Rajbongshi, Sutia and tea garden community. But it is nothing but an attempt to fool the six communities,” chief convener of the committee and general secretary of the All Assam Tribal Sangha Aditya Khakhlari said here.
Both the citizenship bill and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2019, have been listed among the 27 new bills to be introduced in Parliament’s winter session that began November 18. “We oppose the citizenship bill as it is anti-constitutional. If the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2019, is passed, we will move court challenging its constitutional validity,” he said.
Khakhlari said the committee would launch an agitation against the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2019, at Jantar Mantar on December 10. “If the government confers the ST (plains) status to the six communities, the backward Scheduled Tribe (plains) people will be deprived of their rights. We will never allow the government to do so.”
“Chapter X of the Assam Land Revenue Regulation, 1886, prohibits acquiring or possessing by transfer, exchange, lease, agreement or settlement any land in any area or areas constituted into belts or blocks’ by non-tribals which includes the six communities to be given ST status. If these communities are given ST status, it implies that the protection the current STs have under the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Act will be destroyed and they will lose all their land,” he said.

Government puts Deloitte on job for property parity,"  The Bengal government has appointed consulting firm Deloitte to come up with a solution on how to bring parity between the transaction value of a property and the notified circle rate of the area where the property is located.
The state’s move appears to be in response to the repeated representations of the real estate industry and feedback from buyers that circle rates — which are decided by the office of inspector general of registration — are often found to be higher than the actual value of the property in many localities.
At least three meetings have taken place between the state government and the global consultancy, which is expected to submit its recommendation in the coming months.
Deals below Rs 1 crore is levied 6 per cent stamp duty in urban areas and 5 per cent in rural areas, while purchases above Rs 1 crore attract 7 per cent (urban) and 6 per cent (rural).
Since stamp duty and registration fee (1.1 per cent) are imposed on circle rate, tax outgo goes up if the rate is more than the transaction value of the property.

“IGR valuation is a global challenge. It is a complex issue. We have appointed Deloitte to look into the matter. The idea is to imbibe best practices from the globe,” Bengal finance and industry minister Amit Mitra, said.
He was responding to the suggestion of Nandu Belani, president of realtors’ body Credai in Bengal, during ‘Statecon 2019’, a seminar organised in Calcutta on Thursday. The anomalies are visible in many pockets of Calcutta as well as in other towns of Bengal such as Siliguri and Asansol.
Tax trauma
While paying a higher stamp duty is one part of the issue, provisions of the Income Tax Act deal double whammy to buyer and seller alike.
While computing capital gains from sale of an immovable property, the circle rate is considered under Section 50C of the IT Act, irrespective at the rate the transaction is done, and tax is computed on the capital gain.
Likewise, if a buyer purchases a property below circle rate, then the
difference between the price at which property is purchased and the circle rate is considered as deemed income at the hand of the purchaser and taxed at the applicable rate as per 56(2)X of the IT Act.",states
"Only one seat lost, argues BJP"," The Bengal BJP headquarters — 6 Muralidhar Sen Lane –– wore a deserted look on Thursday, reflecting the mood of the state leadership and its supporters after the drubbing in the three Assembly bypolls.
There were no state leaders at the headquarters till the afternoon. State general secretary Raju Banerjee rushed in a while later and tried to put up a brave face before the cameras.
Later in the evening, national secretary Rahul Sinha made a hurried entry, contending that it was “business as usual”.
Banerjee reeled off statistics to argue it is not a 3-0 against the BJP and instead a loss of one seat, Kharagpur Sadar, which party’s state president Dilip Ghosh had won in 2016 and relinquished after winning the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year.
“The other two Assembly seats were never ours. It is Trinamul’s projection that they defeated us in all three. Karimpur in Nadia was Trinamul’s and Kaliaganj in North Dinajpur was a Congress seat,” Banerjee argued.

He claimed that the party had increased its vote share by over 3 per cent in Karimpur — a Trinamul stronghold — compared to the votes it had bagged in the Lok Sabha elections.
Whatever be the official logic, BJP insiders said the bypoll results were indeed a face loss as senior party leader Mukul Roy had assured BJP chief and Union home minister Amit Shah of winning all three Assembly bypolls held on November 25.
“Even with a conservative estimate, the party leadership in Bengal was very confident of winning the Kaliaganj seat while retaining Kharagpur Sadar, maybe after a tougher fight. They were, however, not very hopeful about Karimpur, which has a Muslim population of over 42 per cent,” said a BJP insider.
Roy, according to party sources, had been entrusted with poll management and campaigning in Karimpur for candidate and state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.
Inner party conflicts, overconfidence and the NRC fears had cost the saffron camp in Bengal, said a senior state leader. “The candidate selection in Kharagpur had cost us the most. There had been inner party conflicts too, prompting many of our workers to lie low,” said a party observer.
According to party sources, the Kaliaganj Assembly segment — which had given a lead of 58,000 votes to the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls — had gone to the Trinamul within months following the NRC scare and no major announcement from the Raiganj MP and Union minister Debasree Chaudhuri on demands for special trains to Calcutta.
“NRC is the real reason behind the bypoll debacle after huge victory during the Lok Sabha polls that gave us 18 out of 42 seats,” said a state BJP functionary.
According to the leader, Chaudhuri and other BJP leaders campaigning in Kaliaganj had failed to allay fears on the NRC. “We failed to explain to people the potential benefits of the Citizenship Amendment Bill,” a senior BJP leader from north Bengal said.
Ghosh — who tasted his first defeat since taking over as state party chief in 2015 — said on Thursday he was ready to accept the blame for the party’s debacle.
Sources said Ghosh would on Saturday review the bypoll results to find out the reasons behind party’s poor performance. ",states
Exit of warhorses rattles Congress," A raft of resignations by senior leaders has unnerved the state Congress ahead of the Assembly elections.
The latest to desert the party is former Gandey MLA Sarfaraz Ahmed.
On Wednesday, Ahmed joined the JMM and announced his decision to contest from Gandey on a JMM ticket.
“This is a major loss for the party ahead of the election. Defections are quite normal during the election, but the question is whether we are strong enough in Jharkhand to afford such departures? A handful of people are managing the election from the comforts of hotel rooms in Ranchi. They are completely disconnected from the party workers,” a senior Congress leader said.
The exodus had started with state party president Ajoy Kumar joining the Aam Aadmi Party in August.

Former Congress state president and Lohardaga MLA Sukhdeo Bhagat too quit the party and joined the BJP.
In another major blow to the party, former Jharkhand Congress president and Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu joined the Ajsu Party. Last month, Arun Oraon, who was the chief architect of Congress’s victory in Chhattisgarh Assembly elections and had served as the party’s national general secretary, joined the BJP.
“One by one, our warhorses are switching their loyalty. Our MLA from Barhi, Manoj Yadav, was a prominent OBC face of Congress. For many months, speculation was rife that the BJP was trying to poach him. Our old-timers D.P. Jamudar and Chitrasen Sinku, too, left the party. The members of the district committees in Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Chatra, Gumla and Chaibasa have submitted mass resignations,” a Congress leader said.
Congress is contesting 31 out of the 81 seats as part of the pre-poll tie-up with the JMM and RJD. The JMM is heading the Opposition alliance in Jharkhand and the party’s working president Hemant Soren has been projected as the chief ministerial candidate.
“Gandey was the traditional seat of the Congress that I won on a number of occasions. After the seat was given to the JMM, I requested the JMM leadership to field me as a candidate. As the Congress, JMM and RJD are part of an alliance, it hardly matters from which party I am contesting,” said Ahmed.
However, a senior spokesperson for Congress expressed displeasure over JMM’s electoral game plan.
“Ahmed and Balmuchu resigned from the party because of the JMM. Gandey and Ghatshila were our traditional seats but we gave them to JMM. We made a sacrifice to keep the alliance floating and to make Hemant Soren happy. This is nothing but poaching.”",states
Light on NRC ‘anomalies’," Assam cabinet minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday said the Accountant-General had detected large scale anomalies in funds spent during the update of National Register of Citizens under its former state coordinator Prateek Hajela.
Sarma said he had examined the notes of the Accountant-General on all alleged corruption in updating the NRC. “We did not disclose it earlier thinking it would become an impediment to the update process. Since the update is complete, we must make it public,” he said.
Sarma said the AG had submitted his report in 16 points. “Prima facie it amounts to huge anomalies.”
Sarma said as no one had informed the Supreme Court about the financial anomalies, the court had thought that Hajela was doing fine. “We will now expose his (Hajela) character in the Assembly on December 4 or 5,” Sarma said outside the Assembly on the first day of the winter session.
Sarma claimed Hajela had “done mistakes on mistakes”.

While the Opposition legislators on Thursday staged a walkout opposing any move to scrap the final NRC published in Assam on August 31, Sarma said nobody could accept the register in its present form.
Union home minister Amit Shah recently told Parliament that there would be a nationwide NRC update, including in Assam, triggering mixed reactions in the state. While political parties like the Congress and the AIUDF have opposed scrapping the Assam NRC, the BJP and Assam Public Works, the original petitioner in the NRC case, have welcomed it.
Following a Supreme Court direction, the Assam government recently transferred Hajela to his home state of Madhya Pradesh on deputation for three years. However, criticism from the BJP against Hajela that began after publication of the final NRC, seem unlikely to go away.
Sarma on Thursday reiterated that Assam should be part of the countrywide NRC with the same cut-off date as the rest of the country. “This cut-off date may be 1951, 1961 or 1971. It can be even 1931. It should be same as the rest of the country. But it cannot be after 1971,” he said.
Asked what will happen to the Assam Accord (which sets 1971 as the cut-off date), if the cut-off is made 1951, Sarma said, “Those who had signed the Assam Accord are responsible for it. I am not. It was not signed after taking a consensus at Judges Field. Prafulla Kumar Mahanta had signed the Accord. He is responsible for that. I did not sign it. I am not responsible for it.”
He said even the Assembly had not approved the Accord so far. Hajela could not be contacted for his reaction.",states
Europe holidays slow Metro hustle," The year-end holidays in Europe pegged back the East-West Metro in Calcutta just when the railway ministry was looking to make a dash for the finish line and roll out the first train before the election schedule is out.
Senior railway officials said it would not be possible to inaugurate the first phase of the route before March because of a two-week lag in troubleshooting problems detected during trial runs.
Any software-related problem that crops up during a trial run is immediately referred to experts in Europe, who send back solutions through email. “But since Europe is on a festive break for two weeks till January 5, troubleshooting will have to wait,” an official involved in the project said.
Ansaldo, the company contracted to provide software integration between the trains, signalling system, tracks and platform screen doors, is headquartered in the Italian city of Genoa.
According to officials, snags are often detected during trial runs and the speed of troubleshooting will determine how quickly the project can become operational. East-West trains will first run between the Sector V and Stadium stations, a distance of 5.7km.

“We need another couple of months to complete the trials,” an official said. “A Europe-based independent agency has been hired to run various checks after that. Once an approval comes through, another round of trials will be conducted by the commissioner of railway safety.”
The railway ministry has been pushing projects that are nearing completion so that these can be inaugurated before the general elections are announced and the model code of conduct for political parties kicks in.
The ministry has written to its zonal offices and held a series of meetings with project teams to try and complete them within the next two months.
For the East-West Metro, which when completed will connect Sector V with Howrah Maidan through the Hooghly, trial runs are crucial to ensuring that the signalling system is perfectly coordinated with the software used on the trains. “These trains will have little dependence on drivers,” an engineer said.
March is apparently the earliest that the first phase of the project can be inaugurated. “But if the election dates are announced by then, the project cannot be inaugurated as planned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” an official said.
Metro Railway, which is in charge of the East-West Metro, recently received a prod from the railway ministry through a letter that has since been forwarded to the Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation, the implementing agency.
Railway minister Piyush Goyal had held a meeting with representatives of all zonal railways, including those from Bengal, only a few weeks ago. He enquired from them which projects could be inaugurated in the next couple of months, an official who attended the meeting said.
A railway ministry official said the letters sent out to zonal offices to expedite projects were “routine” for the last quarter of a financial year.
But a railway official involved in several Metro projects in the city said no such letter had been received in recent years.",states
Champions gear up for TSK run," The winner of the women’s 10,000m run at the 2018 European Athletics Championships in Berlin was an Israeli athlete with Kenyan roots whose husband encouraged her to take up professional running.
Lonah Salpeter will be one of the stars of Tata Steel Kolkata 25K, partnered by The Telegraph, on December 15 this year.
Over 15,000 people are expected to participate in the sixth edition of Calcutta’s biggest race.
Salpeter’s early years were spent in a village in west Kenya that had no electricity or running water. She was a good student and got a job at the home of the Kenyan ambassador to Israel. She started running after arriving in Israel in 2008 just to keep fit.
In 2011, she met the Israeli international runner Dan Salpeter. They fell in love and got married in 2014.
Dan, her husband-cum-coach, saw her potential as a runner and by 2013 she was winning national titles.
Salpeter, who will celebrate her 31st birthday three days before Calcutta’s premiere road race, comes as the reigning European 10,000m champion after having won her title on the track in Berlin last year.
She has gradually been changing her focus to the roads in recent years and won the Prague Marathon in May. Salpeter went to the World Athletics Championships two months ago and was among the medal favourites, but she collapsed midway on the track and couldn’t finish the race. She recovered quickly, however, and finished fourth in the Frankfurt Marathon last month.
Salpeter is tipped to challenge the TSK women’s course record of 1:26:01 set by Ethiopia’s Degitu Azimeraw in 2017, said an official of Procam International, the organisers of the race.
Tanzania’s Failuna Matanga, another strong name in the female atheletes’ list, is a familiar face in Calcutta. She had finished third in 2017 and 2018 and would be looking for a higher podium finish this time.
Ethiopians Birke Debele and Guteni Shone have both won international marathons this year, and should also be bidding for podium finish.
At least two in the elite men’s list know what it’s like to stand on the podium at a global championship. Kenya’s Leonard Barsoton is a two-time world cross-country silver medallist, as an under-20 runner in 2013 and then as a senior in 2017.
Ethiopia’s Tariku Bekele took the 10,000m bronze at the London 2012 Olympic Games. He is a brother of Kenenisa Bekele, the distance-running icon who set a course record of 1:13:48 in TSK Kolkata 25K two years ago.",states
Centre picks tea & turmeric clusters," The Centre has identified a tea cluster in Assam and a turmeric cluster in Meghalaya for export promotion under the Agriculture Export Policy.
A product/cluster is identified based on the production contributing to exports, exporters’ operations, scalability of operations, size of export market and potential for increase in export in the short term.
While the tea cluster in Assam comprises Tinsukia, Sivasagar and Dibrugarh districts, which produce the highest quantity of tea in Assam, the turmeric cluster in Meghalaya is from West Jaintia Hills.
Assam produces half the country’s tea output.
The Meghalaya government has launched a mission to register a five-fold increase in the production of Lakadong turmeric, an organic variety grown in the state, to at least 50,000 metric tonne per year in the next five years. At present, the production is around 10,000 tonnes. It also plans to increase the crop area from 2,577 hectares to 6,070 hectares, according to a Mission Lakadong document.

The policy said the focus would be to develop export-oriented infrastructure in the identified cluster areas where integrated post-harvest, processing facilities and laboratories would be set up with support from other agencies.
“Effort would be made to share best practices in smart agriculture, use of mobile app for pest management, Artificial Intelligence and drones,” the policy said.
Commodity boards will provide the framework for ownership of the supply chain starting from farmer registrations, provision of quality inputs, price discovery and farmer training through technical organisation and third-party certification.
“The implementation will require involvement of state agriculture/horticulture/fisheries departments, state agricultural universities, ICAR institutions and food-processing department. This programme can be clubbed with the public-private partnership for integrated agriculture development scheme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna as involvement of private industry is critical for market success,” it said.",states
Partha stirs debate on governor’s post," Senior Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday raised questions on the “very necessity” of governors in today’s India and sought a discussion on whether the post was needed anymore.
The Trinamul Congress leader’s speech during the Assembly’s two-day session to mark the Constitution Day made it clear that the Mamata Banerjee government was all set to amplify its protest against governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.
“It is high time to have a debate over the very need of the post of governor,” said Chatterjee.
Although the list of speakers for the two-day programme was drawn up to discuss the Indian Constitution and its relevance, today’s politics — both in the state and at the national level — took the centre stage in the discourse since Dhankhar’s address on Tuesday.
Unlike other speakers — like former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar and ex-Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan, Dhankhar used the forum to talk about abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for it. The governor in his address on Tuesday also said the position of the “constitutional head of the state has been seriously compromised”.

The treasury bench members in the Assembly were also unhappy with the Raj Bhavan occupant since Tuesday evening as he walked past chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was waiting to receive him, without acknowledging her presence.
Chatterjee didn’t mince his words when he rose to speak on Wednesday.
“Is it constitutional to insult the head of an elected government on the floor of the House? Is it constitutional to criticise the state government after getting invitation on an event?” he asked, referring to the governor’s apparent snub of Mamata.
“In last three years, the expenses of the Raj Bhavan have increased by 2.5 times. Time has come to ponder over the need for existence of the latsahebi post in today’s India,” the parliamentary affairs minister said.
Chatterjee pointed out that the discussion should also be initiated on whether an appointed head of a state could embarrass a popular government. According to him, any clash between the head of the state government and the governor — the Centre’s representative — is harmful for the development of the state and its people at large.
Recounting the debates led by former chief ministers Jyoti Basu and Siddhartha Shankar Ray in the House over Centre-state relationship, Chatterjee said: “Along with debates on centre-state relationship, there used to be questions on the purpose of the post of governors in independent India.”
Urban development minister Firhad Hakim said it was worrying to notice that the heads of states — the governors — going against the ethos of the Constitution. “Governors cannot behave like members of political parties. We have seen that heads of the states often defy the constitution and its articles and make selective choices,” Hakim said.
Dhankhar, however, stuck to his guns even on Wednesday as he kept tweeting about Tuesday’s programmes.
“The video on the Constitution Day would leave nothing to imagination as to what precedence is accorded to the Constitutional Head of State. Time to engage in introspection and not in disinformation,” he tweeted.
In another tweet, he tried to convey that he was open to engage with the chief minister while she remained aloof. ",states
Assam bans sale of gutka for one year," The Assam government has banned manufacture, distribution, storage, sale, transportation and display of paan masala and gutka, which contains tobacco and nicotine, for a year.
The Consumers’ Legal Protection Forum, Assam (CLPF) and the Consumer VOICE, New Delhi, on Wednesday welcomed the government’s move to support the initiative of banning chewing tobacco, gutka and paan masala.
The ban, which comes into immediate effect, follows an order issued by the food safety department under Clause (a) of sub-section 2 of Section 30 of Food Safety and Security Act, 2006.

The notification, signed by Assam’s commissioner of food safety on November 22, said the prohibition comes under regulations 2, 3 and 4 of the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulation, 2011.
Besides paan masala and gutka, any other chewing material containing tobacco or nicotine would also come under the purview of the ban, the notification said.

The director of B. Borooah Cancer Institute, Amal Chandra Kataki, said, “This initiative to ban gutka and paan masala in Assam is significant in view of the high prevalence of tobacco consumption (48.2 per cent) in the state. It is the single major important risk factor for cancer. It is also responsible for cardiovascular disease to stroke, chronic respiratory disease.”
CLPF secretary Ajoy Hazarika said, “The rise in number of tobacco users, especially smokeless, is a cause of worry because it is easily accessible to children and youth. We are working in the state through our programmes to protect the public, especially youth and children, from exposure to tobacco use.”
According to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in 2016-2017, the use of tobacco decreased in India from 34.6 per cent to 28.6 per cent but it increased in Assam from 39.3 per cent to 48.2 per cent in five years.
Leader of the Opposition in Assam Assembly Debabrata Saikia told reporters on Wednesday that the government should also ban gutka production companies, otherwise illegal business will start.
He said gutka is produced in Assam and if it is produced, it will need to be sold too. If the companies are not banned, an illegal gutka syndicate will grow. He said the BJP-led state government had proposed to ban gutka earlier too.",states
"Take 1: Logo, mascot, song"," The organising committee will launch the logo, mascot and theme song of the Khelo India Youth Games, Guwahati 2020, ceremonially here on Saturday.
Announcing this, Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who is also the president of Assam Olympic Association (AOA), on Wednesday said the entire Assam contingent comprising players of all 20 disciplines, will have to be present during the launch ceremony.
Sonowal also reviewed the preparation of contingents by the various state sports organisations during an executive meeting of the AOA here on Wednesday and reiterated that best efforts will have to be put to finish among the top five in the medals tally of the national event for under-17s and under-21s.
He directed the departments concerned and the AOA to provide all possible logistical support, including coaches and support staff, to every single athlete participating in the event. Some of the state associations appealed to the government to take the initiative of engaging reputed coaches in the preparation, admitting that their efforts had failed to impress upon their respective national federations.
In the meeting, AOA secretary Lakhya Konwar stated that only nine state associations out of 20 associations concerned have so far appointed their respective nodal officers to coordinate the team preparations for the Khelo India Games in compliance with a resolution of the AOA’s last meeting held on November 21. Sonowal directed all the associations to submit the names of their respective nodal officers within a day.
The executive meeting also ratified the audited accounts of the past six years and approved of expenses of nearly Rs 45 lakh by the new dispensation in repair and renovation of office and in holding two meetings of the AOA.",states
Stage set for child’s play," A clown from Norway, a dance artiste and an arts educator from Australia, a dance theatre company and a professional storyteller from Scotland — a theatre festival for age three months to 18 years has all this and more to offer.
A real princess lost in her pink world of loneliness is what Norwegian artiste Katja Lindeberg depicted through her clown performance, If Only Rosa Could Do Magic. The show was part of the first edition of ThinkArts International Festival for Young Audience that took off on November 14.
Around 40 children aged above six, parents, artistes and theatre students trooped in as Lindeberg clad in a pink dress, riding a pink cycle and armed with lots of pink toys regaled the audience with her antics.
While the script was dripping in humour, the underlining story spoke of a sad child desperately yearning for the attention of her busy parents. Failure to create the right magic lands her with a dragon mother, in whom she finds solace.
“I wanted to talk about modern issues and also neutralise the role of gender in a child’s mind. So while my story is that of a princess and her pink world, boys end up identifying with the situation as much,” said Lindeberg on her first India tour.

Shaurya Virat Gupta of La Martiniere for Boys loved the performance. “I have seen clown acts before but this was different,” said the Class V student who had come with his friends.
Another top draw has been Chalk About, a show by Curious Seed from Scotland. A fusion of dance, theatre, storytelling and expressive movements, Chalk About is very visual experience.
“We had planned a playful show for children but adults identify with it as much,” said Christine Devaney, who had conceptualised the show.
Devaney and Hendrik Lebon have performed 130 times across the globe from Milan to the Sydney Opera House, before bringing their act to Calcutta.
“There are stories woven in the performance that talk about the relationship of the two performers and that with the audience. It highlights serious issues such as identity, perception and judgement in a playful tone,” Devaney said.
The festival has a range of performances for toddlers, too. Touch and Go presented by Sally Chance Dance from Australia entices, dares and entertains children in a playful environment.
The children are invited to enter a wonderful world of shapes and pathways, stepping stones and lines, with two friendly dancers and a live guitarist. Along the way, they are enticed to become part of the performance.
The opening act of the festival was a documentary theatre — Is This a Dagger? The story of Macbeth — performed by Andy Cannon and Red Bridge Arts of Scotland.
Cannon, Scotland’s award- winning storyteller, not only enacted the play on stage but also revealed some facts about Macbeth.
“We tried to bring a mixed bag of Indian and international performances. A festival of arts for young audience is necessary as it helps children grow, building on their empathy and creativity,” said Ruchira Das, the founder of ThinkArts.
The festival also offered a platform for discussion. “We need to know how much to tell and how to tell. How do we present violence, death or historical events such as Holocaust before a young audience with an impressionable mind? I suggested bringing in children as creative consultants during the making of a play meant for them. And never be didactic,” said Australian artiste Luke Kerridge of Barking Gecko.
The visiting artistes also exchanged notes. “I was looking forward to watching Lindeberg in action and learning from her,” said Kerridge.
Lindeberg herself addressed students at Presidency University on the scope of a theatre clown.

Community support plea for Dhola victims’ kin," Former National Human Rights Commission monitor for minorities and spearhead of peace initiative Karwan-e-Mohabbat, Harsh Mander, has advocated the need for a community support system for the families of the victims of the Dhola killings.
Mander said the state and society have to ensure they are also provided financial security. He also called for a reparation model instead of monetary compensation for the victims’ families, especially for widows and young girls.
The Karwan-e-Mohabbat (Caravan of Love) team comprising Mander, journalist-turned-peace activist John Dayal and Barpeta-based independent social researcher Abdul Kalam Azad met the families of the five men who were shot dead by suspected Ulfa (Independent) militants in this village near Dhola-Sadiya bridge in Tinsukia district on November 1.
The team, besides offering solace and emotional support to the family members, said they have a commitment to evaluate and assess what can be done for them.
“Wherever we go, it is never a parachute visit. We have a commitment to evaluate what can be done for the victims’ families here. What we have observed while interacting with the families is that we have to create a local community support system with trained and informed people. Then we have to help them deal with their grief and loss. There are widows and young girls who have lost their loved ones and their fear can be assuaged by trained care workers,” Mander said.

The team also said the monetary compensation of Rs 5 lakh offered to the families is not a permanent solution, especially when survivors are single women and widows. “When a lump sum is given all at once, it creates more vulnerabilities for women, especially widows. There could be pressure on her to extract the money as we have seen in a large number of cases. We need to think of financial support on a monthly basis rather than a one-time grant,” he said.
The Karwan-e-Mohabbat initiative began in September 2017 after several cases of hate crimes and lynching were reported across the country.
It set out from Nagaon in Assam on September 4 and concluded its journey on October 2 in Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.
During that phase, the team travelled to eight states meeting families of hate crime victims. This was the team’s third visit to Assam and its 24th journey across 13 states in the last 15 months.
The Karwan-e-Mohabbat team’s previous visit to Assam was in October this year to meet people excluded from the National Register of Citizens and also families of those who allegedly committed suicide over exclusion from the final draft NRC.",states
Watch a movie before a maths exam and de-stress: teacher," A movie before the day of your maths exam can help you relax, de-stress and enable you to score better.
This piece of advice might sound too radical for harried parents of students preparing for their boards, but this is exactly what the head of the department of mathematics of St. Thomas College-Dehradun suggested.
Saumyajit Ganguly, also a member of the ISC syllabus committee of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), shared his experiences and provided tips to maths teachers of the steel city on how to help students do better in the subject that is loved and feared in equal measure.
“As a teacher I never entertain students a day before their math exam. Because if you keep doing math you get unnecessarily stressed, something that can affect your paper. So it’s better to relax and watch a movie,” Ganguly, who has also written several ISC text books, said at a workshop organised by ADLS Sunshine School at Kadma on Saturday.
The day-long workshop was divided into two parts, one for class X syllabus and the other for class XII. And Ganguly addressed teachers’ concerns about setting a near perfect question paper, especially with reference to board examinations of 2019. He also spoke about strengthening students’ competencies and enhancing their performance, while updating teachers on the syllabus.

Why do most students consider maths to be one of the most difficult subjects?
Ganguly seemed to blame the home environment when he said, “Students are made to feel that way. Usually parents pass on the phobia.”
“We do stress a lot on maths. We react a lot on maths. I don't think parents come and ask their wards if they have completed their history or Hindi homework. It is always about maths homework, math scores and so on. We kind of pass on the phobia and children grow up with that,” he explained.
More than 50 maths teachers from 30 CISCE-affiliated schools of the steel city were present at the workshop. With a help of a presentation, Ganguly told them about what a student is expected to write, errors that are easily avoidable, essential tips to fetch good marks and mistakes for which students can be penalised.
The idea behind the workshop was to better prepare teachers to help students in Maths. Asked how students could get better marks in board examinations, he said, “Solving more and more authentic question papers, getting it corrected by teachers and also critically analysing papers help.”
As students’ performance also depends on teachers and how they react to their wards, Ganguly told teachers to be proactive, do justice to students by helping them with their concepts as everyone may not be of the same level.
Teachers found the workshop useful too.
“I think a happy maths teacher helps students score better. The workshop shared some valuable tips which we will share with our students. There are students who score very well in board examinations but we forget that that is a small percentage in the entire batch. Hence, these tips will help all students answer papers with much ease,” said Geetanjali Dev Sharma, who teaches at Church School, Beldih.",states
Post-lockdown bed plea to private units," The state government on Saturday asked private hospitals to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients.
At a meeting with private hospitals, health department officials also asked the hospitals that are not conducting the Covid-19 test to set up the testing facilities.
Officials of some private hospitals who had taken part in the meeting said the health department told them that there could be a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases after the lockdown norms were eased and asked them to set up more beds for such patients and testing facilities.
On Saturday, according to the health department, 317 Covid-19 cases were detected in Bengal, taking the total number to 5,130. The state has 8,785 Covid-19 beds.
Health department sources said some private hospitals were asked why they were not admitting Covid-19 patients despite several requests.
“Although most private hospitals in Calcutta have increased the number of beds for Covid-19 patients, there are a few who are still not accepting patients who have tested positive for the virus. We have asked these hospitals to have more isolation beds and not to refer Covid-19 patients to other hospitals,” said an official of the health department.
The health department once again asked the private hospitals to normalise their operations and treat non-Covid patients, too.
“The health department said they were still receiving complaints that some of the private hospitals were refusing patients,” said an official of a private hospital.
Hospitals said one of the main reasons for refusing patients was shortage of doctors. Many doctors have not yet started seeing patients, which was affecting hospital operations, they said.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Friday urged private doctors to return to their clinics. “I want to tell private doctors — doctors attached to private hospitals and private clinics. Please use PPE kits. Please use sanitisers. Take all required protection but start seeing some patients,” Mamata had said.
At Saturday’s meeting, the health department clarified that doctors of private hospitals can recommend home isolation for people testing positive for Covid-19 but have mild or no symptoms. “In that case, the patients have to be under a doctor’s supervision and the private hospital has to be aware of all developments,” an official said.",states
Police sniff Jamtara link in mask fraud," Several people in Calcutta have been duped while making bulk purchase of masks and sanitisers online over the past few weeks.
Police have found that most of the phone numbers that were used to communicate with the victims are active in Jamtara district of Jharkhand.
Earlier, police had arrested several youths from Jamtara for allegedly duping Calcuttans over the phone and stealing their money by convincing them to share their ATM card details and one-time passwords.
The alleged fraudsters would tell their intended victims that their cards were about to be blocked or they had won a lottery they had never participated in. In the majority of cases, the calls had come from Jamtara.
The district in Jharkhand, which shares its border with Bengal, has become infamous for fraudulent online activities that have left many Calcuttans poorer.

Earlier this year, Calcutta police had arrested several youths from Jamtara for their alleged involvement in multiple tele-calling cases that were reported across the city.
Police officers said the Jamtara gang had shifted its focus from ATM cards to masks and sanitisers during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The officers said they had received around six-seven such cases in the past few weeks and most of the calls were found to have originated from Jamtara.
Sources said one of the recent complainants — a dance troupe — had ordered liquid disinfectant from a company based in Jabalpur, whose contact number they had found on an online portal. After transferring a part of the money, the complainant had found that although there was a company by that name in Jabalpur, the phone number of the contact person was different.
“On dialling the landline of the company, a member of the troupe discovered that the company had not received any order from the troupe. It became clear that some fraudster had registered his mobile number with details of the Jabalpur company,” said an officer.
In another case, the complainant had placed a bulk order for N95 masks and hand sanitisers worth Rs 4 lakh through an online portal and paid the entire amount in advance. The consignment was never delivered, police sources said.
The police learnt that the mobile numbers used for fraudulent transactions had been in use in Jamtara and its adjoining areas.
A senior officer at Lalbazar said fraudsters from Jamtara had been changing their mode of operation from time to time depending on the circumstances.
“A few days ago, when sale of liquor was not permissible, they targeted people by claiming they would sell liquor online. Now they have shifted to masks and sanitisers,” the officer said.
The officer added they were requesting everyone to be aware of the phishing techniques and place an online order only from reputable portals.",states
CBI war sparks Tejas and Sushil battle," Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday hit out at Tejashwi Prasad Yadav even as the leader of Opposition cited a report by news portal The Wire alleging that the deputy chief minister “worked together” with CBI additional director Rakesh Asthana and the Prime Minister’s Office “to book” RJD chief Lalu Prasad in the railway hotels case.
Tejashwi said the report — based on the answers given by exiled CBI director Alok Verma to the chief vigilance commissioner — only vindicates his stand that the cases against him and his family are politically motivated.
Sushil, who had been maintaining radio silence over the issue, tweeted in Hindi on Monday: “Whether it is fodder scam or taking land for railway hotels or being owner of 52 properties at the age of 29, when made an accused he (Tejashwi) in order to draw public sympathy expresses full confidence in the judiciary and then alleges he has been framed.”
Sushil’s supporters said that he had never hid his intention to hand over to central agencies documentary evidences he had unearthed against Lalu and family.
Tejashwi, who appeared before a court in New Delhi in the railway land case on Monday along with mother Rabri Devi, declared that both chief minister Nitish Kumar and deputy CM Sushil would go to jail one day.

“The case against us is nothing but motivated by political vendetta. We will tell our side to the court because we have full faith and trust in the court…. In coming days you will see that those who have planned this conspiracy would be found in jail. Nitishji and Sushil Modiji both will go to jail one day,” Tejashwi said.
The next date of hearing the case is December 20, in which Lalu Prasad is to appear through video conferencing.
Tejashwi said Nitish’s claims of no compromise on crime, corruption and communalism are hogwash.
“When Ashwini Choubey’s son Arjit Shashwat tore the FIR, Nitishji could not do anything. The chief minister did not have guts to arrest him and he claims that he cannot compromise on communalism. He is completely with the Sangh ideology now. What happened in the Srijan scam? Why have the kingpin Amit Kumar and his wife Priya not been arrested yet? Many scams took place in Bihar but no action has been taken against any senior officer. Nitishji should answer how much of Bihar’s treasury money was looted in his regime,” Tejashwi said.",states
Rail escalator ache in Bolpur," Passengers have complained that escalators at Bolpur station often remain “switched off” during rush hours, causing severe inconvenience to the elderly and daily commuters.
A group of senior citizens from Bolpur and Santiniketan and a section of the commuters have met rail officials and told them that the non-functioning escalators cause “harassment”.
The escalators connect the entry gates and Platform Number 1 to the second and third platforms through a foot overbridge.
The problems, according to the passengers, become worse when the Santiniketan Express — the most popular train to Santiniketan or the “Abode of Peace” — arrives and leaves from Platform Number 3 instead of Platform Number 1 earlier.
“Most people visiting Santiniketan prefer the train…. But it has become hectic for the passengers to go out of the station because of the non-functional escalators as they need to exit through Platform Number 1,” said Sujit Chatterjee, a resident of Santiniketan.

Kinsuk Pal, a teacher of Sainthia Town High School who travels from Bolpur every working day, complained that their pleas had gone unheard so far.
“We met the station authorities repeatedly to let them know about the problems but it is yet to be solved. As the alternative to the escalators is a ramp — which demands a long walk to get up and down the overbridge — we face trouble when the escalators do not function,” said Pal.
Railway officials claimed some passengers often pushed the “emergency switch” to stop the escalators so that they could use the steps both ways — to get down and get up the over-bridge. “It is not the fault of the railways at all…. They (some passengers) do it as they need to walk a long way over the ramp to get down,” said a senior official.
“Once an escalator is stopped, we do not get to know about it till someone informs the station master. We immediately contact the technicians but they take time to reach and restart the escalators,” the rail official added.
Asked about the complaint, Nikhil Kumar Chakrobarty, the chief public relations officer (PRO) of Eastern Railway, said he “would enquire into the matter”. “We will take immediate action to ensure that the escalators run smoothly,” Chakrobarty added.",states
Naihati senior citizens seek curbs on festival noise nuisance," Over 200 elderly residents of Naihati have submitted a petition requesting the administration to ban high-decibel audio systems and loud firecrackers during Kali Puja this weekend.
The signatories, who sent the letter on Saturday and are being helped by local NGO Prayas, says that despite a gazette notification from the Bengal government in February this year, the local police had not been proactive in taking measures.
The notification had banned speakers and sound-boxes above 55 decibels, in line with a 2017 directive of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
In the notification, the government has prescribed a 90-decibel limit for firecrackers. “It is the old people, children and patients who suffer the most. We have appealed to the police in the past as well but in the end got only empty assurances,” said Arup Bhowmick, secretary of Prayas.
“We have been fighting on this issue for two years. We hope that with this petition, the police and administration will finally take notice and act,” Bhowmick added.

Sources at Prayas said the members had discussed their concerns when the petition was signed.
“Among the issues raised was the Chakda municipality’s decision in 2017 to ban the use of DJ boxes,” said Bhowmik. Chakda is located in neighbouring Nadia district.
The Chakda municipality had banned high-decibel DJ sound boxes in addition to mandating that both puja suppliers and organisers would have to sign an undertaking with the civic body that they would not use such equipment. “If Chakda can, then why not Naihati,” Bhowmik asked.
In spite of the precedent, the Naihati petition is notable given its reputation for celebrating Kali Puja with characteristic fervour. Naihati is home to the renowned 92-year-old Boro Maa Kali Puja, which attracts hundreds of visitors from across the state.
Ashish Mukherjee, retired headmaster of Naihati Mahendra High School who is one of the 200 signatories to the petition, said: “Without strong political will, such bans cannot be implemented. But the police and civic authorities need to be sincere. This festival is supposed to be an occasion of joy but it has become suffocating for so many now. We need this step (crackdown) both for our peace of mind and for everyone’s enjoyment.”
According to Mukherjee, he had personally appealed to a civic functionary, Ashoke Chatterjee, for a Chakda-style ban.
“I am aware of the NGT order and the state government’s notification. However, it is the police who need to take the initiative to implement it. I would request police officers to look into the matter and take steps,” Chatterjee said.
Asked about the matter, Naihati officer-in-charge Anupam Chakraborty said: “We monitor and restrict DJ boxes and firecrackers around the maternity centre (in the area) but in the other areas, people should act carefully.”
“We have begun checks prior to the festive season and will penalise organisers found violating the state government’s directions,” Chakraborty added.
A senior police officer claimed, however, that effective restrictions in line with the state government’s directions would be imposed on using DJ boxes and blasting sound crackers.
“Necessary checking has already begun and if puja organisers are found violating the restrictions, they will be penalised and the instruments seized,” the officer said.",states
32 migrants test positive in Cooch Behar," The detection of 32 Covid cases at one go in Cooch Behar has prompted the district administration to draw up plans to prevent further spread of the pandemic.
Till Thursday, Cooch Behar had been the only corona-free district of north Bengal. However, as the test reports of a group of migrant workers reached the administration from North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, it was found that 32 of them were infected. Most of them are from Dinhata sub-division.
The local business community of Dinhata held a meeting on Friday evening and decided that shops would remain open only from 8am to 11am. “After that, only ration shops and medicine shops will be open. Also, no bikes or e-rickshaws will be allowed to enter Dinhata town from adjoining areas,” said Udayan Guha, the Trinamul MLA of Dinhata.
In Cooch Behar town, Sanjay Pal, the SDO, visited the local markets with a police team. He told the shopkeepers that shops should open on alternate days.
Eight new cases have been reported in North Dinajpur on Saturday. All of them are residents of Itahar block.

Father Stan Swamy's property attached," The police on Monday attached the property of priest-activist Father Stan Swamy at his Namkum home, as he had not appeared in court over a case concerning a Facebook post last year that upheld the demand of Sarna tribals for their own code in the Census.
A 30-member team comprising Namkum OC Praveen Kumar, his Town police station counterpart Jaideep Toppo, sub-inspector Budhilal Murmu and assistant sub-inspector Pyarelal Yadav and 26 more constables attached the priest’s property. “Nothing much was found. Police had to contend with a table, a steel almirah, three chairs and a bed,” said a policeman. Khunti SP Ashutosh Shekhar said the priest’s worldly possessions were attached over a case of an “objectionable Facebook post”. “Father had posted an objectionable post. Following this an FIR was registered against him and others. Despite summons and warrant, when he did not appear in the trial court, an order was sent to attach his property was issued,” SP Shekhar said.
Activist Vasvi Kiro cleared the air on the “objectionable” post. “The FIR was filed against the priest on June 26 last year when he posted on Facebook that Sarna brothers should get their own religious code, a longstanding demand of theirs. In the same FIR, around 20 more are named as co-accused for rallying behind tribal rights,” Kiro said. “Father Swamy is a Christian but fights for tribals irrespective of religion,” she said, adding that the “present situation in the country was not conducive to such people”.",states
Raju Bista in north Bengal coronavirus test push," Darjeeling MP Raju Bista of the BJP has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on “the urgent need to start move Covid testing laboratories” in north Bengal.
Bista arrived in his constituency on the “first flight” from Delhi to Bagdogra on Thursday and is currently in home quarantine in Siliguri.
The MP said in a written statement: “I have found out that thousands of samples collected for testing Covid-19 are lying untested at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital since May 17.”
Bista claimed that the results of four positive cases from the Kurseong sub-division that were released on Friday “are apparently from the samples tested on May 18”. He feared that the delay in testing could result in “exponential increase in Covid numbers in north Bengal”.
“In my letter, I have requested for the establishment of more Covid testing laboratories in district hospitals of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Siliguri Govt Hospital, and also permit private hospitals to conduct COVID-19 tests,” Bista said in the statement, adding that he had also demanded that testing facilities in the region be upgraded to clear all backlogs.
Anit Thapa, the chairman of the board of administrators of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, welcomed “Bista’s decision” but in a sarcasm-laden tone hoped that it would not be like any other of his “280 letters”.
“Till date the BJP MP of Darjeeling has written about 280 letters to different ministers and to various ministries and I hope the letter dated 20/05/2020 with reference number Darj/GN/287 is not yet another letter, but I hope it’s a letter for action for setting up a testing lab in the GTA region,” Thapa said in a written statement.",states
Ranchi traders lock up markets," Angry and insecure over the failure of Ranchi police to arrest the criminals who had shot at and injured two businessmen of the capital last Monday, traders on Monday kept their shops and business establishments closed till 2pm.
Five criminals, suspected from Bihar, shot at brothers and jewellery store owners Rohit and Rahul Kheriwal near Lalpur Chowk in broad daylight on October 14, had an easy escape from Ranchi district and presumably Jharkhand.
Monday’s bandh was called by the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), the apex body of traders of Jharkhand, supported by other groups like Ranchi Goods Transport Association. Ahead of the bandh, FJCCI representatives also distributed around 50,000 pamphlets across the capital seeking support for the bandh, coming as it was right before the Dhanteras-Diwali shopping season, considered to be one of the busiest periods of the entire year.
On Monday, the capital’s two most important commercial hubs, Upper Bazaar and Main Road, bore a deserted look. In the morning, over a 100 traders staged a peaceful protest at Albert Ekka Chowk and also carried a procession across the capital.
President of the FJCCI Kunal Ajmani again said no trader would like to observe a strike but added they were helpless. “In this situation, we don’t have any option,” he said. “Since the past five days we have been carrying out symbolic protests but not a single senior police officer or senior bureaucrat met us to understand our pain. In fact, no political party contacted us,” he pointed out.

He added: “The business community of Jharkhand is the backbone of the state’s economy but there is no security for us.”
Ajmani said they were in regular touch with Ranchi senior superintendent of police Anish Gupta who had assured them that the police were making all possible efforts to trace and arrest the criminals.
“But it is also a fact that the law and order situation in the capital has worsened to an extent that criminals have no fear. If a farmer is in distress, the entire government and political class run to their support. In the case of the business class, they remain silent. Trade can’t flourish amid lawlessness,” Ajmani said.
Sunil Singh Chauhan, president of Ranchi Goods Transport Association, who joined the protest march along with the members of his outfit, said the government needed to understand that trade could only take place in a climate of security.
A week after the gun attack on the Kheriwal brothers — now in Delhi for post-operative care — Ranchi police are still clueless though eight special investigation teams, headed by as many DSPs with 40 officers, are working on the case. A DSP who did not want to be named said some suspects had been detained for questioning. “We are trying to identify the accused but honestly there is no clue so far,” he said.",states

Pep talk for jawans on Home Guard Foundation Day," Governor Droupadi Murmu on Friday boosted the morale of Home Guard jawans at an event organised to observe Home Guard Foundation Day at Central Training Institute in Dhurwa.
“The Home Guard battalion was raised first in 1946 in Mumbai. After the Chinese invasion in 1962, it was organised on a country level. Since its inception, Home Guard jawans have been helping local police to maintain law and order. We should boost their morale. They are already efficient, but we should motivate them to give their best,” Murmu said.
Murmu’s words of appreciation came after the jawan presented the foundation day parade and demonstrated their skills in fire-fighting in the presence of chief secretary Sudhir Tripathi and DG (Home Guard and fire brigade) B.B. Pradhan besides other senior officials.
On the welfare of the jawans, Murmu said, “We should ensure proper utilisation of Home Guard jawans. None of them should be dro-pped from service without proper reason. We should also think about their family. They should also receive respectable honourarium. Efforts should be made to bring them and their family under health insurance,” Murmu said.
Home Guard Foundation Day is usually observed on December 6, but this year it was observed on December 21.

There are as many as 30,000 Home Guard jawans in Jharkhand.
The jawans appreciated the governor’s kind words.
“Home Guard jawans perform duties similar to policemen, but they receive hardly one-fourth of the salary received by cops. Each Home Guard jawans get just Rs 400 per day. After hearing words of appreciation from the governor and seeing her commitment towards the welfare of Home Guard jawans, I feel happy,” Deepak Kumar said.",states

Trinamul clinches Purulia rural body as BJP men switch sides," Trinamul on Thursday secured a majority in the Balarampur panchayat samiti in Purulia after eight BJP members joined the ruling party in the presence of Trinamul MP Abhishek Banerjee.
The formation of the board at the panchayat samiti had been stalled since August over the administration’s apprehensions of law and order problems.
The BJP members who crossed sides said they wanted to be part of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s “development endeavours”.
Abhishek, Mamata’s nephew and Trinamul’s observer for Purulia, was in the district to campaign for the party’s January 19 Brigade Parade Grounds rally.
Balarampur is among four panchayat samitis in Purulia where the BJP had got a majority in the rural polls this summer. But it had managed to form the board only in one after most of its winners switched to Trinamul following alleged intimidation.

In the Balarampur panchayat samiti the BJP had won 17 of the 20 seats and Trinamul three. Now, Trinamul has 11, enabling it form the board.
The BJP had also won two zilla parishad seats and a majority in all seven gram panchayats in the Balarampur block, sending shockwaves through the ruling party’s district leadership.
Balarampur had also come into the spotlight across India over the deaths of two BJP Dalit Morcha workers, Trilochan Mahato and Dulal Kumar, under mysterious circumstances, in June. BJP chief Amit Shah had held a public meeting in Purulia to protest the alleged murders.
On Thursday, the BJP alleged that the administration had stalled the formation of the board since August despite the party’s a clear majority with the “ulterior” motive of helping Trinamul intimidate or luring its members.
“Trinamul is using the administration and police to intimidate our winning members and also luring them with job offers and money to join their party. All were forced or tempted to switch over,” alleged Sayantan Basu, BJP state general-secretary and his party’s district observer for Purulia.
Trinamul denied the charges. “We did not force anyone to join Trinamul. If anyone is inspired by Mamata Banerjee’s development and willingly wants to join our party, what can we do? It is not our responsibility to help the BJP retain them,” said minister Shantiram Mahato, Trinamul’s district president.
The BJP had done relatively well in the rural polls in Purulia, bagging nine out of 38 zilla parishad seats and a majority in 44 gram panchayats out of 170. It had secured a majority in four panchayat samitis out of the 20 in the district. ",states

Under his leadership, the RSP also opposed electoral alliance between the Left Front and the Congress for the 2016 Assembly polls and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The RSP had fielded its own candidate against the Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in Behrampore Lok Sabha seat in 2019 going against the Left Front’s decision of not contesting there.

Behrampore Congress MP Chowdhury referred to Goswami as an honest politician, who will be deeply missed.
Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose said that passing away of Goswami would create a vacuum in Left movement in Bengal.
CPM politburo, too, issued a statement expressing grief over the demise of the RSP leader. “Comrade Khiti Goswami passed away. A stalwart of the left movement in #Bengal. General Secretary of RSP. A great loss. Deeply saddened. My salute,” tweeted Left legislature party leader Sujan Chakraborty.
Goswami always shared a very good rapport with leaders cutting across political lines and was liked by all for his friendly behaviour.",states
Meghalaya ‘tourist cops’ for visitors," The concept of atithi devo bhava (guest is god) will be emulated by “tourist police” in Meghalaya to ensure safety of visitors flocking to the Scotland of the East.
Meghalaya police have engaged tourist police in places like Sohra which are scenic destinations that attract hordes of travellers.
“As part of our pilot project, tourist police in Meghalaya will emulate the concept of ‘atithi devo bhava’ to ensure safety of tourists visiting our state,” Meghalaya police said on their Facebook page.
On Sunday, a senior police officer and tourist police personnel were seen greeting tourists from Thailand who were visiting Sohra.
The tourists were part of the Asian Road Rally covering Thailand, Myanmar, India and Malaysia.

Talent on a roll at techno-cultural fest," Schoolchildren across the steel city were on a creative high during the three-day annual techno-cultural fest, Wheels, which kicked off on Thursday.
Organised by Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) Club, over 4,000 students from 190 schools across Jamshedpur are taking part in the 32nd edition of the fest, which will witness over 40 events.
The preliminary rounds of the fest, which will be spread across three days, kicked off on Thursday at Management Training Centre, Engineers Hall and Telco Recreation Club, all in Telco. The theme for Wheels this year is ‘Ankuran-Nurturing Innovations.’
According to organisers, online registration further aided in the huge number of entries this year. “This year we are witnessing a record footfall. Online registrations started in November and this motivated more students to take part. We even reached out to several schools through social outfits,” said Raneet Roy, one of the GETs.
On the first day, preliminary rounds were held for Danceverse, a dance contest, Sherlocked, a mystery solving game; Swara, a singing competition; Go green where students had to make items out of waste; Yogathon where students had to perform yoga asanas; Step up Scrap up that required students to make innovative items from given materials; Xquizit, a quiz competition; Innovative Technophilia, a presentation on innovative ideas; and Flash, a 400metre relay.
The preliminary rounds of events like Youth Parliament, Crafty Clay, Mad Ad, Nukkad, Word Wizard, Scavenger Hunt, Standup comedy, Facial Art Freaks and Pocket full of Words will be held over the next two days.
A marathon on environment will be held on December 23 from Telco Club. The finals of Wheels will take place from January 11 to 13 next year.
“I love to dance so flaunted some killer moves in the dancing competition. It was a memorable experience,” said Bharti Kumari, a student of Rajasthan Vidya Mandir in Sakchi. ",states
Aadhaar row at Dhanbad Bar association poll," The district Bar association election for 16 posts was held here on Thursday amid noisy scenes as some lawyers were denied permission to vote because they hadn’t brought their Aadhaar cards. The hour-long ruckus notwithstanding, the polling percentage was a high 83.
Altogether 80 candidates for one post each of president, vice-president, general secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, joint secretary (administration) and joint secretary (library), besides nine posts of governing council members.
Sources said trouble started around 11.30am when a section of lawyers showed their Dhanbad Bar Association ID, issued by the Jharkhand Bar Council, instead of Aadhaar cards. The disgruntled group cited a September 26 Supreme Court order that Aadhaar card was mandatory only for filing income tax returns and allotment of PAN, and no longer mandatory for opening bank account, school admissions, mobile phone connections, among others.
They were still denied permission to cast their votes, leading to sloganeering for more than an hour during which many protesters barged into the voting hall on Dhanbad Bar Council campus.
Finally, Jharkhand Bar Council observers Parmeshwar Kumar Mandal, Mritunjay Kumar Srivastava and Prayag Mahto intervened, asking polling officials to consider the Bar association ID as valid proof.

Senior lawyer and three-time president Kansari Mandal said there was no logic to making Aadhaar card mandatory for casting votes. “The adamant attitude of officials marred polling,” he added.
Counting of votes will begin at 10am on Friday.

Assam recalls Lachit valour," Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Sunday urged people to follow the ideals of Ahom army general Lachit Borphukan, to take the state to the path of development.
Addressing a gathering at an event organised on the birth anniversary of the Ahom general at Kachomari Ghat along the Brahmaputra in Fancy Bazar here on Sunday, Sonowal said the youths must have sincerity, dedication and passion in their respective fields to contribute to the state’s growth.
The Battle of Saraighat in 1671 between the Mughal empire, led by Raja Ramsingh I and the Ahom Kingdom, led by Borphukan at Saraighat and the subsequent victory of the Ahoms created the foundation of Assam’s supremacy in the larger contour of the country, Sonowal added.
He added that Borphukan’s valour and resistance that prevented the Mughals to win Assam is an example of the rich legacy of the state and its people. The unflappable heroics of the Ahom general and his patriotism should be emulated by the youth to revive Assam’s lost glory, he said.
The chief minister called on people to take a pledge to build the motherland Bor-phukan had dreamt of. “We need to work hard to re-establish our supremacy,” he said.

Earlier, the chief minister attended another programme, organised by Raised, a voluntary organisation, at Lachit Borphukan Park in Jalukbari.
Aid for maidam: The day was celebrated with Tai rituals at Lachit Maidam, where the Ahom general was buried, at Hoolungaparaa Gohain Gaon under Teok revenue circle in Jorhat.
Addressing a meeting organised by the district administration, Jorhat MP Topon Kumar Gogoi spoke about the contribution of Borphukan for Assam’s emergence as an independent entity. The MP announced Rs 10 lakh for the maidam’s beautification.
Jorhat deputy commissioner Rashni Aparanji Korati, principal of Kendriya Mahabidyalay Munindra Konwar, among others, attended the programme.

Road-trippers set for Calcutta debut,"  A community of road-trippers that includes family members of car owners will make its Calcutta debut with a trip to Bishnupur, Bankura, on Sunday.
The Roadtrippers Club is known for including people who are not conventional road travellers — like pet owners who find trips difficult because they can’t carry their pets or those who are scared of driving on the highway.
“We include their parents, spouse and children. Travelling with many people is much safer than a solo trip. We have carpool options as well for people who don’t know or like driving,” Vineet Rajan, one of the founder members of the club, said in Calcutta on Wednesday.
The club started in Mumbai last January and has since spread to Delhi, Bangalore, Guwahati, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Chennai, Bhopal and Hyderabad. “We have more than 3,000 members in the country,” Rajan said.
On Sunday, more than 30 people will travel from Esplanade to the Bankura town famous for its terracotta temples. “There will be around six to seven cars,” Rikhia Pal, the coordinator of the club’s Calcutta chapter, said. She was based in Mumbai when she became a member of the club. “Since relocating to Calcutta a year ago, I wanted to start a group here,” Pal, who works in the hospitality sector, said.
Members of the club have already made 140 road trips within the country, including trips to Ladakh and Spiti Valley. “We are like a large tribe, moving in a caravan. The cars leading and tailing the fleet have the most seasoned drivers and travellers. The average speed is between 70 and 90kmph, depending on the most novice driver,” Rajan said.
The trippers don’t drive after sunset. Expenses are borne by the participants. Registrations can be done at `www.roadtrippersclub`.",states
Kohli moment on giant screen," A series of guardrails barricaded the area in front of Gate 3 and 4 of the Eden Gardens for VIP movement. Other than cops on duty, a few spectators stood behind the guardrails as the giant screen showed Virat Kohli batting on 59.
As the Indian captain kept adding to his tally, the crowd kept increasing and by the time Kohli crossed 90, there were at least 25 spectators standing there with their eyes glued to the giant screen.
“Dara, century ta dekhe jai. Tuk tak acche. Akhon jaega shift korle jodi out hoe jae (wait, let him complete the century. If we shift from this place, we might jinx him to a dismissal),” a young man, who had been standing for over 20 minutes, told his friend who had just arrived.
Kohli hit a sublime boundary through the covers to move on to 99.
The crowd had to wait for three more balls for the coveted moment. As Kohli tucked Taijul Islam past the square leg for a couple and brought up his 27th Test century, the crowd broke into a loud cheer.

Rare fog in Bengal's Darjeeling," A sea of fog blanketed valleys in Darjeeling on Wednesday, a day after Sandakphu had been enveloped in white following snowfall.
The rare phenomenon, which geographers call advection fog, provided a joie de vivre moment to tourists and local people alike.
Rajesh Thapa couldn’t stop exclaiming “joie de vivre!” when he looked down from the Mall in the Darjeeling town, though the man in his late 40s always lived in the hills.
While Mt Kanchenjungha was glistening against an azure sky, the fog hovered over valleys from Darjeeling to Namchi in Sikkim.
Geographers explained that the snowfall at Sandakphu (12,000ft) and on higher mountains had acted as a catalyst. Sandakphu, the highest point in Bengal, had received a three-inch snowfall on Tuesday morning.

“This is a classic example of advection fog,” said Nima Doma Lama, head of the postgraduate geography department at Siliguri College.
The teacher has said the temperature drops as one gains altitude during normal conditions. “For every one kilometre ascent, there is a drop of 6 degrees Celsius in temperature. This is the normal lapse rate,” she added.
However, when the ground gets colder than the higher slopes and moist air passes over the cool surface, advection fog is formed, said Doma Lama. “We are used to seeing it in text books; it was beautiful to see it in our hills,” she added.
The Darjeeling residents said although fog had formed near the massif in the past too, it was never on the scale of one witnessed on Wednesday.
The social media was flooded with images of picture-postcard hills.
The sky remained clear from morning to evening in the hill town though the fog dissipated by around 10am.
Asked about the difference between cloud and fog, Doma Lama said: “Clouds form at different elevations, starting from the ground level, all the way up to more than 30,000ft. Fog, to put it very simply, is clouds near the ground, where visibility is reduced to less than 1km. When visibility is more than 1km, it is ‘mist’.”
The day was relatively warmer than Tuesday with the noon temperature hovering around 7 degrees Celsius.",states
Gandhi statue repair move," Visva-Bharati’s fine arts faculty, Kala Bhavana, has drawn up a plan to renovate the statue of Mahatma Gandhi — constructed in 1968 by artist Ramkinkar Baij — following a request by President Ram Nath Kovind to the varsity during its annual convocation on November 11.
Sources said the revamp would be the first after the statue was erected 50 years back.
The 25ft high concrete statue, which is uncovered, developed cracks and was damaged by stress.
“Apart from the President’s request, the fact that the entire country is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the father of the nation also made us plan the repairs,” said a varsity official.
On Saturday, senior teachers from Kala Bhavana headed by principal Sanjoy Mallick conducted a preliminary discussion on how the structure would be renovated.

“During his visit, the President wished for the proper renovation of the sculpture of Mahatma Gandhi. We discussed the plan for the renovation with senior teachers, including those from the sculpture department,” said Mallick.
Ramkinkar Baij (1906-80), who designed the statue, is considered to be in the vanguard of modern Indian sculptors. He is renowned for pioneering the use of newer art materials, including concrete, and laterite pebbles from Khoai (the name of a geological formation found in Santiniketan) as prime ingredients of his artwork.
“Ramkinkar is the pioneer of using the cement-concrete medium in his sculptures. He used to throw balls of concrete pulp at iron structures to finish his works,” said Pankaj
Panwar, a professor of sculpture in Kala Bhavana.
Varsity officials said Kamal Dhar, an assistant professor of sculpture at Kala Bhavana, on Saturday proposed seeking the supervision of Asit Dasgupta — the former head of the sculpture department of the Government Art College in Calcutta.
He had worked with Baij during the construction of the Gandhi statue in 1968.
“Professor Asit Dasgupta was my teacher. He is 78-years-old right now. I had heard from him many details regarding the construction of the Gandhi statue by Baij. He was in Santiniketan in 1968 as a student of the eminent sculptor. I think it will be great if we get suggestions from him now. All my colleagues appreciated the idea,” said Dhar.
Varsity officials said there were eight sculptures by Ramkinkar Baij on the Visva-Bharati campus.
The sources said four of them, titled Mill’s Call, Harvester, Sujata and Santhal Family, had been renovated earlier this year under the leadership of Dhar and other senior teachers.",states
Bypolls a test for TMC and PK," Bypolls in three Bengal Assembly seats, campaigning for which ended on Saturday, will be a litmus test for the Trinamul Congress’s claim that it managed to stage a turnaround following its unimpressive performance in the general election.
But the byelections are more challenging for poll strategist Prashant Kishor who was engaged by Mamata Banerjee to reverse the erosion in Trinamul base.
The micro management of Trinamul’s campaign by Kishor’s I-PAC team was the topic of discussions among party leaders in the three seats.
“I have been part of Trinamul’s campaigning for at least 15 years. This time, we went about campaigning in a different manner because we followed whatever the I-PAC team told us,” said a Trinamul leader in Nadia’s Karimpur.
Local Trinamul leaders went about area-wise campaigning in Karimpur based on plans drawn up by a band of youths from Team PK.
Apart from Karimpur, Kaliyaganj in North Dinajpur and Kharagpur Sadar in West Midnapore will also vote on Monday.
A disgruntled senior Trinamul leader, who was sitting idle, was nudged by some youths into campaigning in Kaliyaganj.
Some youths were regularly arming Trinamul leaders with talking points to take on the BJP’s campaign in Kharagpur Sadar.
Six months after the setback that Trinamul suffered in the Lok Sabha polls, the stage is set for another contest between the two main political forces in Bengal.
“Yes, it’s a test for us. But probably, a bigger test for PK and his team,” said a Nadia district Trinamul leader, who was looking after the campaigning of the party’s Karimpur candidate Bimalendu Sinha Roy
The Patna-based strategist agreed to provide a makeover for Trinamul in June. The deal was sealed on June 7 when
Prashant, accompanied by MP Abhishek Banerjee, met Mamata in Calcutta.
From July, the I-PAC team, which includes at least 300 professionals like data analysts, field surveyors and experts in the fields of management, information technology and statistics, began working for Trinamul.
The challenge facing PK is, however, not easy. Out of the three seats, only Karimpur was won by Trinamul in 2016. The ruling party lost Kharagpur to the BJP and Kaliyaganj to the Congress.
Analysis of Assembly segment-wise results of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls reveal that Trinamul secured a comfortable margin in Karimpur, which is under the Murshidabad parliamentary seat. The BJP managed leads both in Kharagpur Sadar and Kaliyaganj.
Sources in I-PAC said around 25 youths had been working for the revival of Trinamul’s poll fortune for the past three months, particularly in Kharagpur and Kaliaganj. They studied what went wrong for the party during the Lok Sabha polls.
A Trinamul leader in Kaliyaganj said: “The PK team began from the grassroots level where we probably failed. The results in the gram panchayat and Lok Sabha polls revealed a sort of isolation at the root. The Team PK tried to re-establish this relationship by reaching out to people.”
Members of the Team PK, who have been largely working as Trinamul’s official ‘Media Team’, also formulated the core planning of the campaigning. “They worked independently surveying the ground realities and provided the feedback to the party and proposed the strategy,” said a young Trinamul leader in Karimpur.
A member of the I-PAC team working in Karimpur said: “We tried to bridge the gap between the party and people and at the same time to identify the glitches.”
Minister Rajib Banerjee, who took an active part in Trinamul’s campaign in Karimpur and Kaliyaganj, said: “We are hopeful people would repose faith on us. In the past few months, the Team PK was working tirelessly. They are satisfied with their job. We too want to be satisfied on November 28 when the results will be announced.”",states
Bengal seal on Aadhaar link," Mamata Banerjee has apparently taken a 180-degree turn on Aadhaar with the Bengal government approving a proposal to link people’s 12-digit unique identification numbers to rations cards.
Sources said a realisation that seeding of Aadhaar numbers with ration cards could help the Bengal government save about Rs 500 crore annually in the food distribution had driven the chief minister to change her stand.
Mamata had been criticising the Narendra Modi government over making Aadhaar compulsory for schemes and benefits and refused to link her Aadhaar to her cellphone numbers.
“The food and supplies department had put forward the proposal as the Centre was pushing the state to go for the process citing a Supreme Court order. The chief minister did not approve it initially. But she changed her mind after an all-party meeting in September okayed the proposal,” said a senior government official.
Sources at Nabanna said Mamata had initially raised questions about the necessity of seeding Aadhaar numbers with ration cards.

“The chief minister was told that the process could save at least Rs 500 crore on the outgo for giving subsidised foodgrains to nearly 8 crore people as it would prevent pilferage. She was also informed that the Centre was pushing hard to go for the process based on the Supreme Court order that made seeding of Aadhaar numbers mandatory for the beneficiaries of welfare schemes. The approval came about one-and-a-half months ago,” said a source.
The food and supplies department has already started the process of seeding Aadhaar with ration cards recently and it is expected that the process could be completed by January next year.
Sources in the government have said as of now, the state spends more than Rs 3,500 crore to provide subsidised foodgrains.
A rough estimate by the state food and supplies department suggests over 15 per cent of the funds could be saved if the state can stop pilferage from ration shops completely.
“Details of the beneficiaries have already been installed in the PoS machines of the ration shops once the digital cards were introduced. Now, biometric details would be liked with the ration cards with the seeding of Aadhaar. Once this is done, only a beneficiary would be able to withdraw his or her quota of subsidised grains by verifying biometric data like thumb impression,” an official said. ",states
It’s lonely living in fire-hit Jharia," On August 19, 2017, the earth caved in at Jharia’s Mohribandh, hollowed out by the underground fire. An old woman died in the cave-in, two others were injured.
Two years and three months later, Mohribandh resident Hari Chaudhary, around 40, is a broken man. Hari, who migrated from village Nimadohar in Bihar’s Gaya district to Mohribandh in Jharia, Dhanbad, in 2001 for a better life for his family, now stays alone. After the subsidence, he told his wife and children — two sons and two daughters — to leave their cracked home and go back to the village in Gaya.
A daily wager, Hari sews jute sacks for a contractor in Jharia for a living. Earlier, he made about Rs 7,000 a month. Now, because he has to travel to Gaya and back frequently, his monthly income has reduced to Rs 4,000. Ironically, his expenses have increased as he has to send money to the village.
He stays alone and says life is hard. “But I could not expose my wife and daughters, aged 20 and 18, and sons aged 8 and 5, to the subsidence again. Our house had developed big cracks after the August 2017 incident. It could have fallen on our heads while we were asleep. We were all shaken,” he said.
He added that he had to send his children back to the village hurting their education. “My older daughter is a matriculate, my younger daughter has to appear for her matriculate. My younger daughter, however, has to appear for her matriculation. My sons were studying at the Gujarati School here, I was happy with their education. Back in the village, their studies are suffering.” In Mohribandh, smoke and fire had been a part of their lives since 2001, but life had its moments too. “My sons were born here in Jharia, my income increased, we were all staying together. We had some good times here too till the subsidence changed everything. Many people fled in fear. I am staying here in a one-room place in Mohribandh because I don’t know where to go after my house developed cracks and I earn so little,” he said.
He added that Dhanbad mayor Chandrashekhar Agarwal, then ADM (law and order) Rakesh Kumar Dubey and local politicians had visited them after the incident and promised better rehabilitation. “Nothing happened,” he said.
What about the government’s long-in-the-making rehabilitation plans in the form of flats in Belgarhia, some 5km from Mohribandh?
“I don’t know,” Hari said. “All I know is that I have filled up all the forms and applications for the Jharia Rehabilitation and Development Authority (JRDA, the implementing agency for Jharia master plan). Don’t know when I will get a safe home. But Belgarhia has its own difficulties. It’s a remote place, there is no transport. I’ll have to walk to work and back,” he added.
More than 5 lakh people — or around 1 lakh families — live at 595 underground fire affected sites of Jharia, Katras, Nirsa and Baghmara which are together traditionally called the Jharia Coalfileld Region.
Does he have any message for politicians ahead of Assembly polls? “When they ask for my vote, I’ll ask them for my home,” he said.",states
A rivulet that tells the tale of capital neglect," The state government’s much touted Harmu rejuvenation project has done little to prevent the river, which once used to be the lifeline of the city, from turning into a drain.
Dirty water flows through the river, which originates in Nagri and terminates at Subernarekha after covering a distance of 17.5km in Ranchi district.
The concrete banks on both sides of the river are the only visible difference that the first phase of the project worth Rs 78 crore has made.
People walking past the water body have to cover their nose to block out the stench.
“It stinks so much that we feel like throwing up,” said Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Harmu, who has to cross the bridge over the rivulet often. Rachana Kacchap, a resident of Purani Ranchi, agreed.
“We still remember the day when we used to drink the river water after filtering it. The river bank was one of our favourite picnic spots. Now, we can’t even think of washing our hands in the river,” Kacchap said.
An official of the urban development department admitted the problem.
“On February 25, 2015, a contract was signed between the state urban development department and a Mumbai-based private company, Eagle Infra India Limited, for the rejuvenation of Harmu river. Since then, the project is being jointly implemented by Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company (Juidco) and the private firm. The government has so far spent nearly Rs 78 crore for reviving and beautifying the river, the desired result has not been achieved,” the official said.
A Juidco official, who is directly involved with the rejuvenation work, supported the urban development department official.
“When the detailed project report (DPR) of the first phase was prepared, there were only a dozen major drains connected to the river. However, around 50 more big and small drains have come up since then and it has become difficult for us to treat such a huge amount of filthy water. Despite the construction of seven sewage treatment plants, low-cost sanitation toilets and pathways and planting of over 10,000 saplings, the river has failed to attract people. The government is often blamed for the poor planning,” the official said.
Urban development secretary Ajay Kumar Singh said the river water would become clean after the second phase of the project that would begin after the Assembly elections.
“We would have already started work if the dates for the Assembly elections had not been announced. In the second phase, construction of a few more sewage treatment plants has been planned. Very soon, fresh water will flow in the river,” Singh added.",states
Sparks fly as Roy heads into Das lair," The first skirmish in the high-profile election war in Jamshedpur East between chief minister Raghubar Das and his former cabinet colleague Saryu Roy erupted on Saturday afternoon.
Roy, the sitting Jamshedpur West MLA, is contesting as an Independent candidate from Jamshedpur East — the chief minister’s home constituency — after being denied the ticket from Jamshedpur West, allegedly at the behest of Das.
On Saturday, Roy had gone to campaign with nearly 50 supporters to Raghubar Nagar and the nearby Basti Nagar, two urban slums in Burmamines that have a sizeable number of supporters of Das.
“Apprehending trouble, we had informed the local police station as well,” said Vishal Kumar, campaign manager of Roy. “As soon as Saryuji entered the urban slums 10-15 youths started hooting and shouting expletives.
“They kept on following us, chanting Raghubar Das zindabad and Saryu Roy murdabad. We kept on requesting them that since it is election season every candidate has the right to campaign in each area of his constituency and they should allow us to do so. Even the Burmamines police personnel kept on requesting them. However, they continued heckling us till we completed the campaign after 15 minutes,” Kumar added.

Raghubar Nagar was established in 2007-08 for those evacuated from old Long Town Basti, also in Burmamines. Rambabu Tiwari, a close aide of Das, is believed to have been instrumental in settling the locals in the urban slums and last year the roads were widened and boundary walls at the entrance of the urban slums beautified under the local MLA fund. The nearly 2,000 voters of the slums are loyal to Das.
BJP district president Dinesh Kumar Sahu, however, denied the allegation from the Roy camp.
“The supporters of Saryu Roy started shouting expletives first and when the local residents reacted they started heckling them and even damaged the flowerpots kept along the road for beautification, which resulted in minor injury to a BJP worker. Now they are trying to blame the BJP workers to seek sympathy vote,” Sahu said.
The BJP leader claimed that despite all such tactics, Das would win from Jamshedpur East by a landslide margin and lead the next government in Jharkhand.
“The Saryu Roy camp is getting desperate while Raghubarji is helping in campaigning of party candidates in other constituencies. We are confident of victory by a comfortable margin and lead the next government as people have realised the development achieved under the double engine sarkar,” Sahu said.
Burmamines police station officer in-charge (OC) Vivekanand Singh said no complaint was lodged from either side.
“We have got no complaints from either side. Our personnel were present at the site and we interfered and settled the issue soon after hooting started from both sides during campaigning,” OC Singh said.",states
Scam-apathy finger at Dispur," The Anusuchit Jati Yuba Chatra Parishad, Asom, on Saturday accused the state government of not taking action in a Rs 8 crore scam in the Assam Fisheries Development Corporation (AFDC) Ltd.
Parishad president Rubul Das said in 2017-18, AFDC allotted Rs 100 crore for 106 clusters under the Rural Infrastructure Development Funds-XXI scheme for management of the fishery sector.
He said AFDC selected 200 contractors for execution of the scheme. “Apparently, on March 3, 2019, fishery department joint secretary Nirmal Kanti Debnath, the then managing director of AFDC, in association with assistant engineer Mahitush Barman, released a sum of Rs 8 crore to 70 contractors without approval from the director. The department neither monitored nor inspected the progress of the work,” Das alleged.
He alleged that the contractors have not even achieved 20 per cent progress in the work.
Das said AFDC chairperson and MLA Rama Kanta Dewri lodged a complaint with chief minister Sarbanada Sonowal highlighting the anomalies on May 8. “We also lodged a complaint regarding this with the chief minister on May 15,” Das said.
After receiving the complaints, Sonowal ordered a probe by a committee, headed by former AFDC managing director and retired ACS officer Swapan Kumar Das, which submitted its report on June 26, 2019. “The report clearly exposed the corruption and brought to light the involvement of four officials of the AFDC — the then managing director Nirmal Kanti Debnath, senior project engineer in-charge Mahitush Barman, assistant superintendent Ujjal Das and accountant Tarini Deka. The inquiry also exposed how certain documents were fraudulently furnished to release the bill,” Das , who got a copy of the report through RTI, claimed. The Telegraph is in possession of a copy of the report.
Das claimed that Dewri had told him that he recently visited Choumakhi Meen Mahal in Kamrup, Chandkhola Meen Mahal in Dhubri and Kathalguri Meen Mahal in Kokrajhar and found that the contractors were yet to initiate work as per the “work order”.
“After exposure of all the anomalies, a junior engineer of AFDC forwarded the Rs 8-crore bill to project director for financial approval on May 8, though the money was already withdrawn on March 3.”
However, according to Das, the project director declined to approve the bill, citing lack of “measurement and evaluation report” and “necessary forwarding” from the accounts and finance official of the corporation.
Das alleged that even after the complaint to the chief minister’s vigilance cell on May 16, no action was initiated. “Without punishing the errant officials, the government promoted Debnath and transferred Barman to Barak Valley,” he futher alleged.
Das said if no action is taken against the errant officials, the parishad will launch a protest.

Assam's Dwijing fest to begin next week," A record turnout of around 15 lakh visitors is expected in the third edition of Dwijing Festival on the banks of the Aie river in Chirang district of Assam from December 27 to January 7.
The venue is near the Hagrama bridge on the Chapaguri-Malivita road, leading to the Bhutan border. It is a three-hour drive from here and 15km from New Bongaigaon station.
A curtain-raiser, held here on Wednesday, was attended by tourism minister Chandan Brahma and Assam Tourism Development Corporation chairman Jayanta Malla Baruah. An ad jingle on the festival was also released.
The festival started as Aie River Festival in 2016-17 to promote river tourism in the rural areas under the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC). Last year, its name was changed to “Dwijing (river bank in Bodo language)”.
A galaxy of stars, including Kailash Kher, Amit Trivedi, Malaika Arora Khan, Himesh Reshammiya, Neeraj Sridhar, Bhoomi Trivedi, Shweta Pandit and Great Khali, will perform during the festival.

“The third Dwijing Festival will be held as a calendar tourism festival organised by Assam Tourism and Bodoland Tourism. We have done everything to popularise it. National and foreign tourists will enjoy the river festival, which will feature ethnic food and culture, adventure sports and ethnic games,” Baruah said.
“There will be joyrides on helicopters, hot air balloons and speedboats for adventure-seekers. We are expecting around 15 lakh visitors from the country and abroad. This kind of festival leads to economic development of the surrounding areas. We will also develop other festivals like Judima and Umrangso, so that people from around the world come to participate.”
Baruah said though the festival is being supported by the state government, he wanted it to be self-sustaining. He said ticket prices would compensate for the expenditure incurred.
Brahma said accommodations would be available in nearby towns of Kokrajhar and Bongaigaon. Tents at the venue can be booked online. ",states

Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das promises new industry hub," The groundbreaking ceremony of the one MTPA greenfield steel plant of Vedanta Group, worth Rs 2,200 crore, will take place at Manoharpur block in West Singhbhum in January while a new industrial area will sprawl over 200 acres at Manoharpur and Chaibasa.
Chief minister Raghubar Das made these much-awaited announcements while addressing the inaugural function of a two-day vendor development programme for defence and railway sectors on the premises of Adityapur Auto Cluster, around 5km from here, on Wednesday.
The event, organised by the state government in association with Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) and supported by the Union railway and defence ministries, is aimed at boosting the Make in India initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and developing potential MSMEs of Adityapur, the state’s largest industry hub, into vendors for rail and defence companies.
In his brief speech at the function, which began an hour late, Das said his government wanted to develop the capacity of MSMEs. “Hence, we have ensured bank loans to the tune of Rs 136 crore for 1,114 MSMEs functioning under Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority (Aiada) in the last two months,” he said, urging rail and defence majors to explore investment opportunities in Adityapur.
The chief minister also called on the railway ministry to set up an office of Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in the Adityapur industrial area. In the same vein, he urged the ministry to establish a wagon factory either in Palamau or Santhal Pargana region.

The guest of honour, Union minister of state for railways Rajen Gohain, said the business ambience in Jharkhand was overwhelming.
“Yahan ka mahol sahi mein serious aur inspiring lag raha hai. Jharkhand aisa state hai jahan sabhi industries ke raw materials moujud hai. Par uska proper capacity utilisation nahin ho pa raha hai. Aaj desh mein naye entrepreneurs ko encourage karne ke liye Diwali se pehle MSME policy laya gaya. Isse naye entrepreneurs ka janam easy ho gaya hai (The atmosphere here is serious and inspiring. Jharkhand is a state that can source raw materials for all kinds of industries. But, the capacity utilisation is not up to the mark. In an attempt to encourage new entrepreneurs, the MSME policy was announced before Diwali. This has helped promote new entrepreneurs),” Gohain, an MP from Assam, said.
Gohain spoke on the Make in India initiatives and how the micro and small enterprises cluster development programme was helping in quality upgrade and productivity.
Director-general of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) S. Guruprasad stressed on quality and high-precision R&D.
“We provide strategic protection to the country. Therefore, we rely on high-tech equipment developed in-house. More than 1,000 MSMEs are currently partnering with us, apart from 40 PSUs in defence sector. The local industries here can also be developed as vendors if they have proper R&D set-up,” he said.
The function saw online groundbreaking ceremony of 90 industrial projects worth around Rs 1,200 crore, MoU of which were signed during Momentum Jharkhand in February 2017. The new industrial projects will provide direct employment to around 10,000 people and generate another 20,000 indirect jobs.
Among others who addressed the gathering were state industry secretary K. Ravi Kumar, chairman of CII-Jharkhand chapter Killol Kamani, chairman of RSB Group S.K. Behera and president of ASIA Inder Agarwal.
The two-day event will see various technical sessions and interaction of railway and defence sector companies with prospective local entrepreneurs. An exhibition with over 100 stalls is open at the venue.
The meet coincides with Tata Motors shutting down operations as a part of block closure for four days, beginning Wednesday. During the block closure, there will be no production of heavy commercial vehicles.
The fall in demand for heavy vehicles is said to be the reason behind the forced shutdown. However, the company maintains that the block closure is for maintenance work .
Adityapur, a hub of ancillary units of Tata Motors, has over 600 MSMEs manufacturing and supplying auto components directly or indirectly to the automobile major.",states
Bypoll in 130 panchayat seats in Jharkhand today," Equipped with ballot boxes and other items, polling parties left the capital on Tuesday to hold by-elections in seven panchayat seats across five blocks of Tamar, Sonahatu, Angara, Silli and Ormanjhi on Wednesday.
Across Jharkhand, bypolls will be held in 130 seats.
As many as 27,948 voters, including 14,177 men and 13,771 women, will exercise their voting rights at 83 booths to elect three members of panchayat samiti and four mukhiyas in Ranchi.
“There are 83 polling parties and each party has been provided two ballot boxes. We have also made an arrangement to provide recommendation letter to first voter in each booth. Counting of votes will take place on December 22 in Pandra,” said deputy commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray during a news meet on Tuesday.
Of 83 booths, 51 are located in Naxalite-affected areas. The booths have been divided in seven clusters and 25 sector-cum-zonal officers and four super zonal officers have been deputed. Besides, a control room will operate from 7am under the watchful eyes of an executive magistrate. Also one can report complaints on the helpline 9431927652.
“As majority of booths are in Naxalite-affected areas, over 1,000 security personnel, including para military forces and state police personnel, have been deputed. Proper deputation has been done at strategic locations around the booths. Officers-in-charge of concerned police stations have also been directed for regular patrolling,” SSP Gupta said.
Garhwa mukhiya post

Fourteen ward members have already been elected to the panchayat. “The bypoll will be held at 12 booths, out of which nine have been declared sensitive. As many as 82 security personnel have been deployed,” said DC Harsh Mangla. ",states
Brace for bank rush ahead of closure," Two nationwide bank employee strikes juxtaposed with Xmas holidays will translate into a nearly week-long bank closure in Jharkhand from Friday, a predicament that has left customers particularly traders jittery.
Private and public sector banks across the state, including 1,090 branches in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad, will remain closed from December 21 to 26, barring December 24. People are worried that the long bank break will lead to cash crunch in ATMs.
Lalpur resident Lalita Minz said a strike before Christmas was inconvenient. “I will have to withdraw a substantial amount by Thursday. Most ATMs will run dry,” she said.
State general secretary of Confederation of All India Traders Suresh Sonthalia warned of huge rush at banks and ATMs from Wednesday.
“Very few people will risk going to the bank on December 24 alone. Hence, one must be ready for the jostle from tomorrow. The long break will hit businesses with heavy cash flow because they will face safety issues. Cheque clearances will also be delayed,” he said.

Banks will remain closed on December 21 to honour a nationwide strike sponsored by the All India Bank Officers Confederation to push for full mandate for Scale I to VII officers, salary revision and introduction of five-days-a-week job. On December 26, another strike has been called by the employees’ union under the banner of United Forum of Bank Union in protest against a central decision for merger of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank.
East Singhbhum lead district manager and Bank of India officer Falguni Roy tried to allay fears, saying ATMs would be replenished with cash by trusted private vendors.
Lead district manager of Ranchi Sanjay Kumar Sinha agreed. “We are aware of possible problems customers may face during the closure. Hence, it will be ensured that ATMs don’t run dry,” he said. ",states
Gap to save Tallah pipes," The municipal corporation wants the new Tallah bridge, which would be built after pulling down the existing one, to leave a 2-metre gap under the road below it so that the water pipes can pass unhindered.
Metro had reported on Monday that the civic body had asked engineers of the public works department (PWD) to prepare the design of the new bridge without disturbing the water pipes.
An official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said there were 12 water pipes running under the Tallah bridge. While some of the pipes bring water to the Tallah water reservoir from the Palta water treatment plant, some carry water to various parts of Calcutta.
“We want the design of the new bridge to include a 2-metre gap beneath the road under the bridge. This will leave space for pipes to pass without any hindrance,” said a CMC official.
The CMC produces 440 million gallons of potable water every day to cater to around 45.6 lakh people. A little over half the volume is routed through the Tallah tank, which was inaugurated in 1909. “Impact on any one of the pipes bringing water to the tank or taking water away from the tank for distribution can badly disrupt water supply in Calcutta,” said a CMC engineer.

“We cannot afford any situation where pipes linked to the Tallah water reservoir will be disturbed. Water from the Tallah tank is distributed to areas as far as Bhowanipore. Almost the entire north and central Calcutta survives on water from the Tallah tank,” the CMC official said.
Before the plan is finalised, CMC engineers have flagged their concerns so that there is no error in calculation.",states
Fire in Park Street shop," A garments showroom on the second floor of a commercial building on Park Street caught fire early on Thursday.
Park Street woke up to the sight of a blazing building on Thursday morning. Seven tenders took around eight hours to douse the flames, which were spotted by the building’s guards. The fire was put off by 8.20am.
Thick smoke was seen coming out of the second floor of a four-storey building at 48A Park Street, near the Mullickbazar crossing, around 1am on Thursday. The building houses 22 showrooms of garments, saris, handloom goods and jewellery, including sari store Suruchi.
Police cordoned off the area to ensure traffic was not affected.

But no one was injured or trapped as all shops in the building were closed and empty, police said.
“The guards spotted the fire and alerted us. A forensic team came and collected samples from the shop. The cause or origin of the fire is yet to be established,” said Alok Agarwal, whose brother-in-law owns AP for Women.
Glass windows of the showroom started breaking because of the the heat generated inside as the flames leapt upwards.
The fire was contained before it could reach the lower or upper floors, officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station said.
“It was sheer luck that the fire could be contained in time. All the floors are full of inflammable articles such as fabric,” an officer said.
Firefighters used ladders to reach the second-floor windows and sprayed water from the front of the building. Another team approached the showroom from its entrance inside the building.
“There are so many buildings in the neighbourhood. There was every possibility if the fire spreading,” said a resident of Loudon Street, a stone’s throw from the spot.",states
Waste to wonder: a lesson for all," An army of students cleared their school of junk and used discarded items to set up a model home on the campus.
The 500-odd students emptied the cupboards at The Akshar School and storerooms and found pieces of ropes, used bottles, broken flowerpots, torn cloth, mugs and much more. The trash was painted and reused for Artistic Living, an exhibition organised last Friday.
Visitors to the exhibition were greeted with a patch of green. Students of Class V had beautified and spruced up the school garden with handmade bird feeders, painted pebbles and flowerpots made of old jeans.
“We were taught how to turn discarded denims into flowerpots and how to create a small pond out of an old tub. I am surprised they look so good now,” said Class V student Kesha Jasani, who was involved in giving the garden a makeover.

Inside the school building, the students had created a model home, done up exclusively with recycled goods. The walls of the living room were decorated with painted egg trays and old toys, while the dining area had coasters made from old CDs and kitchen napkins turned into fashionable serviettes.
A discarded suitcase had been turned into a shoe rack and old shirts given a new life as cushion covers. Every room had fancy vases, used terracotta knick knacks, patchwork rugs, wall hangings, bedcovers and storage spaces created from discarded items.
Priyadarshini Sengupta of Class V proudly showed off an old hat that was turned into a fruit bowl. Near the kitchen, stood a piggy bank made with an old water bottle.
The centrepiece in the bedroom was a toy basket made of recycled objects.
“Students learn best through such practical experiences. As they beautified the school, they also learnt many recycling tricks that will help them later,” said Kavneet Khullar, the principal of the school.
Visitors were also treated to live art shows on the Chipko Movement, the threat of urbanisation on the environment and Avni the tiger’s killing.",states
"Harold Evans, editor with a backbone, dies"," Harold Evans, one of the most influential media figures of his generation and voted “the greatest newspaper editor of all time” by journalists in Britain, has died of heart failure in New York at the age of 92.
Some of Britain’s best known journalists who worked for Evans when he championed investigative journalism as editor of The Sunday Times, London, from 1967 to 1981 paid tribute to the crusading editor who believed facts were sacred and that unbiased and independent reporting was essential in a functioning democracy.
One of them was Ian Jack, the former editor of Granta, who told The Telegraph: “Harry had an almost Victorian belief in the capacity of journalism to improve and enlighten its audience, and went to great lengths to make complex subjects intelligible to the lay reader. Clarity was an obsession. As an editor, he was inspirational, sympathetic and generous. I and many others were lucky to have worked with him and for him. He gave me opportunities — reporting in India was one of them — that changed the direction of my life.”
Assessing what made Evans “an editor’s editor”, Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of The Guardian, said: “He could do it all. Write like a dream; design with impact; edit with flair; dash off the perfect headline; crop a picture…. There was no one who knew more about the craft of journalism, nor anyone to match his passion for communicating that craft — documented in numerous textbooks that were, in turn, studied by generations of would-be journalists.
“What was the one immutable rule of journalism, I asked him in 2010? ‘Things are not what they seem on the surface. Dig deeper, dig deeper, dig deeper’.”

Rusbridger added: “Harry knew there was no point in publishing stories if you didn’t defend them. Though often thin-skinned, he possessed that useful piece of editorial equipment: a backbone.”
The campaign for which Evans is best remembered is exposing the “Thalidomide scandal”, launched in 1972, involving Distillers, a company whose drug prescribed to pregnant women to control morning sickness caused thousands of babies in Britain and across the world to be born with missing limbs, deformed hearts, blindness and other problems.
Along the way were months investigating the life and treachery of the British spy Kim Philby, and exhaustive reporting of what actually happened in Derry on Bloody Sunday in 1972 when 14 demonstrators were shot dead by the British army.
Evans forged his reputation as editor of the Northern Echo in Darlington in the 1960s, where his campaigns resulted in a national screening programme for cervical cancer and a posthumous pardon for Timothy Evans, wrongly hanged for murder in 1950.
Stephen Grey of Reuters, where Evans was editor-at-large, wrote in a tribute: “Evans liked to quote his famous 19th Century predecessor at the Northern Echo regional paper, William Stead, who on appointment declared: ‘What a glorious opportunity of attacking the devil, isn’t it?’”
His fortunes changed when Rupert Murdoch bought The Sunday Times and The Times after a strike by print workers had closed the papers for a year. Evans was moved to the editorship of The Times but quit after a few months.
About his relationship with Murdoch, Evans said: “My principal difficulty with Murdoch was my refusal to turn the paper into an organ of Thatcherism. That is what The Times became.”
He wrote about his experience in his book, Good Times, Bad Times and concluded: “Ultimately, all stands or falls on the values and judgement of the proprietor. At its highest levels, a great newspaper is not simply a personal possession but a public trust.”
In 1984, he and his second wife, Tina Brown, made a new life for themselves in America. While she edited Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, he became the founding editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine and later president of the publishing giant, Random House.
The couple became leading socialites on the New York scene — their legendary parties were attended by the great and the good.
Pulitzer-winning journalist Robert D. McFadden wrote in The New York Times: “At a party or a breakfast, Mr. Evans conveyed a world-weary charm, talking in cultured tones of books and newspaper adventures. Wiry at 5-foot-7, he could appear slightly rumpled from all the travel. Under flyaway hair, his expression was typically thoughtful, a face out of Fellini: gaunt, intense, lined with a lifetime of editorial decisions.”
McFadden recalled that Evans feared for the future of newspapers and what impact their decline might have on the democratic institutions.
Evans had said in 2009: “The kind of investigative journalism, which I think is the absolute essence, is in danger and, in fact, in many places has vanished. We have to have this searchlight to know what the hell is going on. So when newspapers or TV neglect reporting, so you get chunks of opinion without any factual basis whatsoever, we’re all going to suffer for it.”",world
"2,500 students at Swiss school quarantined"," Swiss health authorities have ordered a quarantine for 2,500 students at a prestigious hospitality management school in the city of Lausanne after “significant outbreaks” of Covid-19 that are a suspected byproduct of off-campus partying.
Authorities in Switzerland’s Vaud canton, or region, said all undergraduates at the Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne, known as the Lausanne Hospitality Management University in English, had been ordered to quarantine both on and off-campus because the number of outbreaks “made a more targeted closure impossible”.
“The earliest elements of an investigation indicate that the organisation of one or more parties was at the origin of these many outbreaks of infection,” the Vaud regional office said in a statement, adding that the parties seemed to take place before new containment measures in the region were announced on September 15.
School administrators were taking “all necessary measures” to ensure that classes were continuing online, the statement said.
University spokesman Sherif Mamdouh said on Thursday that 11 students had tested positive for the coronavirus and none required hospitalisation.

Peaceful transition? We’ll see: Trump on election," US President Donald Trump declined on Wednesday to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the November 3 election to Democratic rival Joe Biden and said he expected the election battle to end up before the Supreme Court.
“We’re going to have to see what happens,” Trump, a Republican, told reporters when asked whether he would commit to transferring power.
The President, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, has repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, asserting without evidence that mail-in voting would lead to fraud and a “rigged” outcome. “The ballots are a disaster,” Trump said.
Democrats have encouraged voting by mail as a way to cast ballots safely during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of Americans, including much of the military, have cast absentee ballots by mail for years without problems.
In 2016, Trump also raised questions about whether he would accept the results of the election. He went on to win the presidency.

Biden told reporters in Delaware that Trump’s comments on the transition of power were “irrational.” His campaign said it was prepared for any“ shenanigans” from Trump, and reiterated comments from July that “the US government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.” Trump, who is moving quickly to nominate a successor to liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday, said earlier on Wednesday he thinks the election “will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it’s very important that we have nine Justices”. Trump plans to announce his nominee on Saturday.
A Senate confirmation vote before the election would seal a 6-3 conservative majority on the court, potentially spelling trouble for Democrats should it be called on to decide any legal dispute over the results of the election.
“This scam that the Democrats are pulling, it’s a scam, the scam will be before the US Supreme Court, and I think having a 4-4 situation is not a good situation,” Trump said.
Only one US presidential election, the 2000 contest between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, has had its outcome determined by the Supreme Court.
Earlier, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Biden said Republicans were “violating the essence” of what the country’s founders had intended in quickly seeking to fill the Supreme Court seat. ",world
Facebook oversight board debut plan before US polls," Facebook Inc’s long-delayed independent oversight board plans to launch in mid-late October, just before the November US presidential election, although a board member said he did not know whether it would hear cases related to the contest.
The board, created by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, will initially have the power to review decisions to take down posts from Facebook and Instagram, and recommend policy changes.
Oversight board member Alan Rusbridger told Reuters in an interview that the board was now aiming for an October launch. A spokesman confirmed that timetable, saying the launch, originally planned for last year, had also been slowed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Rusbridger said he did not know whether the board would hear cases about content connected to the US presidential election, but he said cases involving President Donald Trump’s posts were not among those that the board had looked at for trial runs.
“We haven’t done a Trump case,” said Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of Britain’s Guardian newspaper. “We have done a nudity case, we’ve done a blasphemy case.”

The board will initially review only appeals over posts that Facebook has taken down, rather than content the company decides to leave up. Some experts say that means it will be of little use in addressing problems such as misinformation and hate speech.
It will also at first only deal with individual posts, not Facebook ads, or groups.
Rusbridger declined to comment on Facebook’s policy of exempting politicians’ speech and ads from its third-party fact-checking programme, though he said: “I can’t imagine we won’t have a case brought to us on that.” ",world
US cops shot at during protests after Breonna Taylor case verdict," Two police officers were shot and wounded late on Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky, during protests of a grand jury ruling decried by civil rights activists as a miscarriage of justice in the fatal police shooting of a Black woman in March.
The grand jury decided that none of the three white officers involved in the deadly police raid on Breonna Taylor’s apartment would be charged for causing her death, though one officer was indicted on charges of endangering her neighbours.
The indictment came more than six months after Taylor, 26, a Black emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse, was killed in front of her armed boyfriend after the three officers forced their way into her home with a search warrant in a drug trafficking investigation.
Her death became a symbol, and her image a familiar sight, during months of daily protests against racial injustice and police brutality in cities across the US.
Following the grand jury announcement, protesters immediately took to the streets of Kentucky’s largest city and marched for hours chanting, “No lives matter until Black lives matter,” amid sporadic clashes with police in riot gear.

The demonstrations remained mostly peaceful until several gunshots rang out as heavily armed police closed in on a throng of protesters at nightfall, ordering the crowd to disperse about a half hour before a 9pm curfew was due to go into effect.
A Reuters journalist on the scene heard gunfire erupt from the crowd moments after police had fired chemical irritants and “flash-bang” rounds.
Two officers were shot and wounded, interim Louisville Metropolitan Police chief Robert Schroeder told reporters.
One suspect was arrested, and the two wounded officers were in stable condition — one undergoing surgery — with non-life-threatening injuries, Schroeder said.
Earlier in the day, about a dozen people were arrested in a skirmish between hundreds of demonstrators and a group of law enforcement officers in the Highlands neighbourhood just outside downtown Louisville. Some windows of nearby businesses were also broken. The crowds largely dissipated after Wednesday night’s shooting. The police said at least 46 arrests were made in all.
Sympathy protests were held in several cities on Wednesday, including New York, Washington and Chicago. In announcing the grand jury’s conclusions, Kentucky attorney-general Daniel Cameron said the panel had declined to bring any charges against two of the three white policemen who fired into Taylor’s apartment on March 13.
The two officers, Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, were found to have been justified under Kentucky law in returning fire after Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, shot at them, wounding Mattingly in the thigh, Cameron said.
Walker has contended he believed intruders were breaking into Taylor’s home and that the couple did not hear police announce their arrival.
The third officer, former Detective Brett Hankison, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree, an offense that ranks at the lowest level of felony crimes in Kentucky and carries a prison sentence of up to five years.
Cameron, however, said there was “no conclusive” evidence that any of Hankison’s bullets struck Taylor.
“There is no doubt that this is a gut-wrenching, emotional case,” he said at a news conference.",world
New normal: Classes in pool cabanas," This summer, Michelle Carucci’s family cancelled its annual Jersey Shore vacation because of the pandemic. So when Carucci, who lives in White Township, learned that The Great Wolf Lodge, a family-favourite indoor water park in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, was setting up a “schoolhouse” and socially distanced activities this fall, she jumped at the chance to take her youngest child.
Gianna Carucci, 11, has all her classes online, and during the mornings of her and her mother’s two-day stay (in the middle of the week, when rates were lower and crowds were smaller), she headed to “Wiley’s Schoolhouse”: a large conference room repurposed to be a socially distanced learning space for children aged 5 and up.
Named after the brand’s wolf mascot, each space is equipped with desks that are placed eight to 10 feet apart and fitted with plexiglass partitions. Open Monday through Thursday, the room is staffed to help children connect with their schools, provide snacks and lead break-time activities. Reservations are required for the programme, which costs $85 per day. All participants must wear masks.
It would be “nice to have a few hours to myself while Gianna is in school,” Carucci, 45, a health and fitness coach, said in an interview before their trip. After classes wrapped up, she and her daughter played at the lodge’s water park together.
The coronavirus has left hotels and resorts scrambling for guests as occupancy rates plummeted in the spring. Some properties have tried to drum up business by touting new cleaning regimens, rethinking amenities and offering free nights. Others closed entirely, waiting or unable to wait for the public health situation to improve. Now, with the pandemic ongoing and millions of school-age children juggling remote learning, some hotels are beckoning families with offers of “schoolcation,” including new staffed learning spaces, technology and tutors — even partnerships with museums and other educational experts.
Learning officer
Usually, families with schoolchildren are tied to their school’s calendar, with vacations often limited to during the holidays.
But now, for those with the flexibility and desire to travel, “there’s an opportunity for a change in scenery,” said Kathleen Reidenbach, chief commercial officer with Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, a line of boutique hotels owned by IHG.
Kimpton recently introduced a “chief virtual learning officer” to nine of its properties this fall, an on-site employee who will take on this role to help with Wi-Fi, virtual meeting software or other technical needs. Some locations will provide free school supplies, kid-sized desks snack packs, document printing and flexible checkout times to guests with school-age children.
Reidenbach said while many families can now travel in September and October, they may need help managing remote work and school. “We wanted to adjust our programming,” she said, to make that possible. 
Nancy and Jim Liddell from Connecticut decided to venture into New York City for a few days this month with their three children. The family hoped to go to the newly reopened Metropolitan Museum of Art and to see the new Suffragist statues in Central Park.
The Liddell daughters, aged 9 to 13, attend public school and now have a school week that alternates between in-person and online instruction depending on the day. “We planned to go when class was online,” Liddell said. Staying at the Kimpton Muse Hotel in New York City, the girls were given festive school supplies and had the desk space and Wi-Fi they needed to attend class. “The hotel made sure we didn’t have to worry about the girls not being able to complete their school work,” said Liddell, who works in financial services.  While five Great Wolf Lodge properties are repurposing conference rooms into “Wiley’s Schoolhouses,” the brand is not alone in carving new “virtual classrooms” out of existing space. The W South Beach hotel in Miami, after closing completely in March, plans to reopen in November with poolside cabanas that can be set up with desks, including small ones for grade schoolers, as well as Wi-Fi and a sound system. Prices range from $500 to $700 a day (private academic tutors are also available, as are personal trainers to provide physical-education classes. Pricing is ala carte.) In Florida, the Four Seasons Orlando Resort is outfitting dedicated staffed learning spaces for a maximum of six children per room, with an outdoor terrace for breaks and craft time. Half-day sessions cost $50 per child.
Some hotels that don’t have the space are partnering with a local museum: Schoolchildren staying at the Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach can complete their schoolwork at the nearby Clearwater Marine Aquarium Education Center and then participate in tours and activities with a marine biologist there. Stays include two spa treatments for the parents and start around $479 per night.

“Today, as part of our continuing fight against communist oppression, I am announcing that the treasury department will prohibit US travellers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government,” Trump said at a White House event.
“We’re also further restricting the importation of alcohol and Cuban tobacco,” the Republican President said at the ceremony honouring Bay of Pigs veterans and commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1980 Mariel boatlift that brought 120,000 Cubans to Miami.
Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has sought to unwind a detente with Cuba pursued by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama.
In June 2019, the Trump administration imposed heavy new restrictions on travel to Cuba, saying the move aimed to further pressure the communist government over its support for Venezuela’s embattled President Nicolas Maduro.
The treasury department had said at that time that the US would no longer allow so-called group people-to-people educational travel, one of the most popular exemptions to the overall ban on US tourism to Cuba. 
Earlier this year, the Trump administration ordered Marriott International to wind down hotel operations in Cuba. Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, was the first US hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid the normalisation of relations sought by Obama.
The US sanctions have further crippled an economy already struggling with a decline in aid from Leftist ally Venezuela.
The move also comes as Trump and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden remained locked in a tight race in Florida, a state that Trump won in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points. Trump’s aides believe his toughened stance on Cuba, as well as Venezuela, has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in the state.
No Republican has won the presidency without Florida since Calvin Coolidge in 
1924, and Trump will hold a rally in Jacksonville on Thursday.",world
Eiffel Tower evacuated for several hours after bomb scare," The Eiffel Tower was evacuated for several hours on Wednesday after police received a call suggesting a bomb had been placed there.
The Paris monument had been searched and no explosives found, a police spokesperson said. The tower reopened around 2.25pm. 
Several hundred people, including tourists, restaurant staff and workmen were led away from the tower in the late morning. “It was an orderly evacuation, there was no panic,” said Manuel, a tour guide on site. ",world
James Bond namesake found in Polish Cold War archives," Poles were left shaken and stirred by news that a suspected British agent called James Bond was on Her Majesty’s secret service in the country in the 1960s, after the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) posted about him on social media.
According to the institute’s archive, James Bond came to Poland on February 18, 1964, and was officially employed as an archivist for the British Embassy Military Attache. He soon came to the attention of Polish counter-intelligence officers.
“We know he was in Poland... in 1964 and 1965,” Marzena Kruk, director of the IPN’s archive, told Reuters.
“He travelled a bit around Poland... he liked women, the same as his literary namesake, but there is not even a word about Martini,” she said, referring to the fictional character’s favourite tipple. “However, there is information that he liked Polish beer.”
Bond was under strict surveillance, and visited the Bialystok and Olsztyn regions of northeastern Poland to try and “penetrate military facilities” in the Soviet satellite state, according to the files.

However, he was found not to have made contacts with Polish citizens, which would have had serious consequences for any Poles suspected of working with agents from the other side of the Iron Curtain.
The British agent 007 created by author Ian Fleming hit the silver screen in 1962 when actor Sean Connery played the character in the film Dr. No, leading some to suspect British spies may have been playing a joke on their Polish counterparts with their choice of pseudonym.
“Maybe it was a bit of fun with Polish counter-intelligence, maybe he had a sense of humour,” Kruk said.",world
Robots to kill virus at London station," Robots that can kill the coronavirus with ultraviolet light have been brought in at one of London’s biggest train stations, St Pancras International, as it tries to restore customer confidence in the safety of travel hubs.
Stations suffered a blow on Tuesday when Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to work from home again where possible and also ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a second wave of Covid-19 infections.
St Pancras International saw 34.6 million entries and exits in the year to March 2019, the most recently available yearly data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), making it the ninth-busiest station in the country. The ORR has said the pandemic caused a dramatic fall in rail use.
“The main thing for us is to get the confidence of customers,” said Jay Newton, head of stations engineering and operations for the high speed, one-channel tunnel rail link.
“We are the first train station to bring this type of technology in because we want to allow people to use a train station with confidence, use our retail units with confidence, and slowly get back to a normal way,” he told Reuters.

The robots use ultraviolet light to sweep large areas without the need for chemical disinfectant, the station said, adding the technology could kill nearly 100 per cent of bacteria and viruses — including the coronavirus — on surfaces and in the surrounding air in minutes.
St Pancras International is the terminus of the Eurostar link to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and also shares links to six London Underground lines with neighbouring King’s Cross station. Prime Minister Johnson on Wednesday promised to help companies try to save jobs put at risk by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“These are indeed tough times, and I have no doubt that many businesses, many employees are feeling a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty, and we will do our level best to protect them throughout this period,” Johnson said in Parliament. 
He said Britain had a massive package of measure to protect jobs, and would be looking at creative ways to do more. “We’re looking at a massive package of investment now in jobs and growth... in the short, medium and long term,” he told Parliament.
He said “of course” the government was also going to come forward with more measures, but ruled out a simple extension of the existing furlough scheme. ",world
"US coronavirus death toll nears 200,000"," The death toll from the spread of coronavirus in the US was approaching over 200,000 lives on Monday, more than double the number of fatalities in India, the country reporting the second-highest number of cases in the world.
The US, on a weekly average, is now losing about 800 lives each day to the virus, according to a Reuters tally. That is down from a peak of 2,806 daily deaths recorded on April 15.
During the early months of the pandemic, 200,000 deaths were regarded by many as the maximum number of lives likely to be lost in the US to the virus.
Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump defended his handling of the crisis. He admitted to playing down the danger of the coronavirus early on because he did not want to “create a panic”.
With barely six weeks left before the election on November 3, Trump is behind Democratic rival Joe Biden nationally in every major opinion poll and is neck and neck in key swing states. Trump’s handling of the pandemic and subsequent economic downturn has battered his standing among many voters.

Trump has frequently questioned the advice of scientific experts on everything from the timing of a vaccine to reopening schools and businesses to wearing a mask. He has refused to support a national mask mandate and held large political rallies where few wore masks.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield recently told Congress that a face mask would provide more guaranteed protection than a vaccine, which would only be broadly available by “late second quarter, third quarter 2021”.
Trump refuted the timeline for the vaccine and said it might be available in a matter of weeks and ahead of the November 3 election. On Friday he said he expected all Americans to have a vaccine by April.
Biden, who often wears a mask and has said he would require masks nationwide, has warned against a rushed release of a vaccine, saying, “Let me be clear: I trust vaccines, I trust scientists, but I don’t trust Donald Trump.”
The CDC currently predicts that the US death toll will reach as high as 218,000 by October 10.
The University of Washington’s health institute is forecasting coronavirus fatalities reaching 378,000 by the end of 2020, with the daily death toll skyrocketing to 3,000 per day in December.
Over 70 per cent of those in the US who have lost their lives to the virus were over the age of 65, according to CDC data
The southern states of Texas and Florida contributed the most deaths in the US in the past two weeks and were closely followed by California.
California, Texas and Florida — the three most populous US states — have recorded the most coronavirus infections and have long surpassed the state of New York, which was the epicentre of the outbreak in early 2020. The country as a whole is reporting over 40,000 new infections on average each day.
As it battles a second wave of infections, the US reported a 17 per cent increase in the number of new cases last week compared with the previous seven days, with deaths rising 7 per cent on an average, according to a Reuters analysis.
Six out of every 10,000 residents in the US have died of the virus, according to Reuters data, one of the highest rates among developed nations.
Brazil follows the US in the number of overall deaths due to the virus, with over 136,000 fatalities.",world
"Trump, Democrats on clash course over Supreme Court seat"," President Donald Trump and his adversaries mobilised on Sunday for an epic campaign-season showdown over the future of the Supreme Court even as the nation prepared to honour the life of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in an outdoor viewing to be held according to pandemic-era guidelines.
The President’s determination to confirm a replacement for Justice Ginsburg before the November 3 election set lawmakers on a collision course with one another at a time when Congress already has major issues on its agenda, including spending bills to keep the government open past next week and a stalled coronavirus relief package to help millions of Americans left unemployed by the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people in the US.
Undaunted by the prospect of such a volatile fall, Trump prepared to announce a nominee as early as Tuesday in hopes of pressuring the Senate to ratify his choice before voters decide whether to give him a second term and spoke multiple times with senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Even as a moderate Republican senator reaffirmed her opposition to such an accelerated timetable on Sunday, others like senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee fell in line and it appeared increasingly likely that Trump may get the votes to proceed, although there were a few holdouts still to be heard from.
The political manoeuvring took place even as the nation was mourning Justice Ginsburg, a champion of women’s rights and a hero to the left who died at age 87 on Friday night.  Former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Junior, the Democratic presidential challenger, on Sunday denounced Trump’s decision to move ahead with a nomination and appealed to the handful of moderate Senate Republicans to stop the President from making a lifetime appointment that would shift the balance of power on the nation’s highest court without waiting to see the results of the election.
“To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power,” Biden said in a speech in Philadelphia, noting that Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama’s nominee after Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, citing the coming election. “

If Trump wins the race, Biden added, then the Senate should consider his choice. “But if I win the election, President Trump’s nomination should be withdrawn,” said Biden. 
“As the new President, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation vote.”
A new poll showed that the American public agrees with him and opposes Trump’s plan to rush a new Justice onto the court. Of those surveyed by Reuters and Ipsos since Justice Ginsburg’s death, 62 per cent said her seat should be filled by the winner of the November election.
One reason Trump may feel differently is the possibility that he may not be that winner. Biden has consistently led the President in polls for months.
The White House hopes that a Supreme Court fight will make a difference when everything up until now has not, giving Republican voters who care about the courts, particularly those opposed to legal abortion, a reason to turn out for him despite any concerns about his handling of the coronavirus, the state of the economy or other issues.

Data hurdle to Europe operations: Facebook," Facebook has told Ireland’s high court it cannot see how its services could operate in the European Union if regulators freeze its data transfer mechanism, the Sunday Business Post reported, citing court documents seen by the paper.
The US social media giant last week said the Irish Data Protection Commission, its lead EU regulator, had made a preliminary decision that the mechanism Facebook uses to transfer data from the EU to the US “cannot in practice be used”.
Facebook requested and secured a temporary freeze on the order and a court review in the Irish high court, which is due to consider the issue in November.
In an affidavit submitted to the court to request that the order be frozen, Yvonne Cunnane, Facebook Ireland’s head of data protection and associate general counsel, said it was not clear how the company could continue providing services in the EU if the Irish order is enforced, the Sunday Business Post reported.
“It is not clear to (Facebook) how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,” the newspaper quoted the affidavit as saying.

The affidavit has not been made public, a high court spokesman said, and a Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
In a September 9 blog post that first confirmed the investigation by the Irish regulator, Facebook said it “relied on the mechanism in question — under what are known as standard contractual clauses — to transfer data to countries outside the EU and that a ban would have “a far-reaching effect on businesses that rely on SCCs”.
The Irish investigation follows a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July on when SCCs can be used legally. The ruling was in response to EU concerns that the surveillance regime in the US might not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the US for commercial use.",world
TikTok: US deal to fight ‘fake history’," US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he supported a deal in principle that would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US, even as it appeared to conflict with his earlier order for China’s ByteDance to divest the video app.
TikTok will be owned by a new company called TikTok Global and will have its headquarters in the US, possibly in Texas, Trump said. Oracle Corp will take a 12.5 per cent stake in TikTok Global and store all its US user data on its cloud to comply with US national security requirements, the companies said.
Retail giant Walmart said it would take a 7.5 per cent stake in TikTok Global. ByteDance, which retains 80 per cent stake, has agreed to create 25,000 new US jobs at TikTok, up from a little over 1,000 now. “I said, you know, do me a favour, could you put up $5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to the real history of our country, not the fake history,” Trump said on Saturday.",world
Taiwan wary of China’s wider threat," Two days of Chinese military aircraft approaching Taiwan demonstrate that Beijing is a threat to the entire region and have shown Taiwanese more clearly the true nature of China’s government, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Sunday.
Multiple Chinese aircraft flew across the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait and into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Friday and Saturday, causing Taiwan to scramble jets to intercept. China claims Taiwan as its own territory.
“These activities are no help to China’s international image, and what’s more have put Taiwan’s people even more on their guard, understanding even better the true nature of the Chinese communist regime,” Tsai said. “Other countries in the region also have a better understanding of the threat posed by China.… The Chinese communists must restrain themselves, and not provoke.”
Tsai said China’s recent activities were a threat broader than just to Taiwan. “China’s existence is indeed aggressive and will bring a definite threat.” ",world
US court halts WeChat ban," A US judge early on Sunday blocked the Donald Trump administration from requiring Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to remove Chinese-owned WeChat for downloads by late Sunday.
US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said WeChat users who filed a lawsuit “have shown serious questions going to the merits of the First Amendment claim, the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff’s favour”.
Her 22-page order added the prohibitions “burden substantially more speech than is necessary to serve the government’s significant interest in national security, especially given the lack of substitute channels for communication”.

On Friday, the US commerce department had issued an order citing national security to block the app from US app stores owned by Tencent Holdings and the justice department had urged Beeler not to block the order. Tencent and the justice department did not immediately comment.
Beeler’s preliminary injunction also blocked the commerce order that would have barred other transactions with WeChat in the US that could have dramatically degraded the site’s usability for current US users or potentially made it unusable. The US commerce department did not immediately comment.
WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the US, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.
The justice department said blocking the order would “frustrate and displace the President’s determination of how best to address threats to national security”.
Beeler wrote “certainly the government’s overarching national-security interest is significant. But on this record — while the government has established that China’s activities raise significant national security concerns — it has put in little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all US users addresses those concerns”.
WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users. The justice department also argued that WeChat users could switch to other apps or platforms.
The WeChat Users Alliance praised the ruling “as an important and hard-fought victory” for “millions of WeChat users in the US”.
Michael Bien, a lawyer for the users, said “the United States has never shut down a major platform for communications, not even during war times. There are serious First Amendment problems with the WeChat ban, which targets the Chinese American community”.
He added the order “trampled on their First Amendment guaranteed freedoms to speak, to worship, to read and react to the press, and to organise and associate for numerous purposes”. Beeler also noted “there are obvious alternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices”.  ",world
"Fears over safety, Astra releases Covid vaccine blueprint"," AstraZeneca revealed details of its large coronavirus vaccine trials on Saturday, the third in a wave of rare disclosures by drug companies under pressure to be more transparent about how they are testing products that are the world’s best hope for ending the pandemic.
Experts have been particularly concerned about AstraZeneca’s vaccine trials, which began in April in Britain, because of the company’s refusal to provide details about serious neurological illnesses in two participants, both women, who received its experimental vaccine in Britain.
Those cases spurred the company to halt its trials twice, the second time earlier this month. The studies have resumed in Britain, Brazil, India and South Africa, but are still on pause in the US. About 18,000 people worldwide have received AstraZeneca’s vaccine so far.
AstraZeneca’s 111-page trial blueprint, known as a protocol, states that its goal is a vaccine with 50 per cent effectiveness. To determine with statistical confidence whether the company has met that target, there will have to be 150 people ill with confirmed coronavirus among participants who were vaccinated or received placebo shots.
However, the plan anticipates that a safety board will perform an early analysis after there have been just 75 cases. If the vaccine is 50 per cent effective at that point, it might be possible for the company to stop the trial early and apply for authorisation from the government to release the vaccine for emergency use.

Dr Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert at Scripps Research in San Diego, said AstraZeneca’s plan, like those of Moderna and Pfizer, had a problematic feature: All count relatively mild cases of Covid-19 when measuring efficacy, which may hamper efforts to determine whether the vaccine prevents moderate or severe illness.
Such plans are not usually shared with the public “due to the importance of maintaining confidentiality and integrity of trials”, Michele Meixell, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca, said in a statement.
The company has released few details about the two cases of serious illness in its trial. The first participant received one dose of the vaccine before developing inflammation of the spinal cord, known as transverse myelitis, according to a participant information sheet for AstraZeneca’s vaccine from July. The condition can cause weakness in the arms and legs, paralysis, pain and bowel and bladder problems.
The case prompted a pause in AstraZeneca’s vaccine trials to allow for a safety review by independent experts. A company spokesperson told The Times last week that the volunteer was later determined to have a previously undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, unrelated to the vaccine, and that the trial resumed shortly thereafter.
The company said it had not confirmed a diagnosis in the second case, a participant who got sick after the second dose of the vaccine. A person familiar with the situation who spoke with The Times on the condition of anonymity said the participant’s illness had been pinpointed as transverse myelitis. The trial was paused again on September 6 after she fell ill.
The condition is rare, but serious, and experts said that finding even one case among thousands of trial participants could be a red flag. Multiple confirmed cases, they said, could be enough to halt AstraZeneca’s vaccine bid entirely.
“If there are two cases, then this starts to look like a dangerous pattern,” said Mark Slifka, a vaccine expert at Oregon Health and Science University. “If a third case of neurological disease pops up in the vaccine group, then this vaccine may be done.”
The company’s chief executive told investors about the problems but did not discuss them publicly until the information was leaked and reported by the new website STAT. Dr Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee on vaccines, and other experts noted that transverse myelitis is rare, diagnosed in only about one in 236,000 Americans a year. The trial in Britain involved only about 8,000 volunteers.
If a serious side effect was definitively linked to AstraZeneca’s vaccine, scientists would need to determine if its root cause stemmed from the adenovirus vector it uses, or perhaps the coronavirus genes it carried.

"Nawaz Sharif launches scathing attack on Pak Army, Imran govt","   Pakistan's deposed premier Nawaz Sharif on Sunday staged a political comeback by criticising the powerful Army and said the Opposition was not against Prime Minister Imran Khan but against those who brought an ""inefficient"" man to power.

Addressing the All-Parties Conference (APC) hosted by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) via a video link aimed at launching a protest movement against the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, the three-time premier launched a scathing attack on the ruling party for its failure to address the basic problems of the people .
Sharif, 70, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) supremo, has been living in London since November last year after the Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for four weeks for treatment.
On Friday, PPP chairman Zardari talked to him over phone and invited him to virtually attend the Opposition-led All Parties Conference (APC) scheduled to be held on Sunday.
Addressing the conference, Sharif criticised the country's powerful establishment for allegedly supporting Khan.
""Our struggle is not against Imran Khan. Today, our struggle is against those who installed Imran Khan and who manipulated elections (of 2018) to bring an inefficient man like him into power and thus destroyed the country, he said.
Sharif said that the foremost priority should be to remove this selected government and this system , adding that ""if the change is not brought, it will bring irreversible loss to this country.
He asked the powerful Army to stay away from politics and follow the Constitution and vision of the country's father Quaid-e-Azam' Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
It is very important that our armed forces stay away from our governmental system according to our Constitution and the Quaid's speech, and not interfere with the people's choice. We have made this country a joke in our own eyes and internationally as well, he said.
Sharif pointed out that former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani once said that there was ""a state within a state"" in Pakistan.
It is saddening that the situation has escalated to a state above the state. This parallel government illness is the root-cause of our problems, he said.
He asked the leaders attending the conference to make important decisions to change the system of the country, alleging that the current government has enforced martial law in the country.
This conference should bring forth a concrete plan of action for saving democracy, a concrete policy should be made for solving the problem of a parallel state I again urge this all-party conference to go beyond its traditional ways and form a plan of action, he said.
Sharif reiterated that the vote of people should be honoured which was the only way to save democracy and the country.
""Pakistan has been constantly deprived from a democratic system. When the vote is dishonored, the entire democratic system becomes meaningless. When it is decided before the election process as to who will win and who will lose, then it can be guessed how the public is betrayed and how the public's mandate is stolen, he said.
He said that military dictators ruled for multiple years but none of the elected prime ministers had been allowed to complete the allotted five years.
Without naming former military dictator Pervez Musharraf, he said that the court did not act against him for suspending the Constitution.
Courts gave dictators the right to play with the Constitution and acquitted someone (Musharraf) who suspended the Constitution twice. Whereas the ones who follow the Constitution are still in jail, he said.
The powerful Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.
Before Sharif, former president Asif Ali Zardari also addressed the conference through a video-link and criticised the government which he said was using the tactics to suppress the Opposition.
It is important that all parties join hands to get rid of this government, he said.
PPP chairman Bilawal is hosting and presiding over the conference with several opposition parties attending it to chalk out a course of action to launch protests against the government.
Sharif, his daughter Maryam and son-in-law Muhammad Safdar were convicted in the Avenfield properties case on July 6, 2018.
Sharif, who was deposed in 2017, was also sentenced to seven years in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case in December 2018. But, he was bailed out in both cases and also allowed to go to London for medical treatment.
He was given eight weeks to return but failed to come back due to health complications, according to his lawyer.",world
Covid: UK call for lockdown," Britain is likely to need to reintroduce some national coronavirus lockdown measures sooner rather than later, a leading epidemiologist and former senior government health advisor said on Saturday.
Neil Ferguson, a professor of epidemiology at London’s Imperial College, told the BBC the country was facing a “perfect storm” of rising infections as people return to work and school.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that he did not want another national lockdown but that new restrictions may be needed because the country was facing an “inevitable” second wave of Covid-19. “I think some additional measures are likely to be needed sooner rather than later,” Ferguson said.

"Twin airstrikes on Taliban, 12 civilians killed"," At least 12 civilians were killed on Saturday in twin airstrikes on a Taliban base in the northeastern Afghan province of Kunduz, a provincial official said.
Defence ministry officials in Kabul, who said more than 40 Taliban fighters had been killed in the strikes, did not confirm any civilian casualties. The incident comes as the warring sides hold peace talks.
The Taliban accused Afghan forces of killing at least 40 civilians. The militant group did not comment on casualties among their fighters. ",world
Amal quits as envoy over Brexit backtrack," Boris Johnson suffered another blow to his reputation when Amal Clooney, a top human rights lawyer and wife of Hollywood star George Clooney, resigned as the UK government’s envoy on media freedom after taking issue with the British Prime Minister’s decision to override part of the Withdrawal Agreement he himself signed last year with the European Union.
Amal, who took on the responsibility in July last year of campaigning for journalistic freedom around the world, resigned after failing to secure any reassurances in a face to face meeting with foreign secretary Dominic Raab.
Boris has already been warned of the consequences of unilaterally breaking a binding international treaty by five former Prime Ministers while Democratic candidate Joe Biden has said there is little chance of a UK-US free trade agreement being signed under his presidency if pledges on Northern Ireland contained in the agreement are flouted.
In her resignation letter, Amal said she was “disappointed” to have to resign because “I have always been proud of the UK’s reputation as a champion of the international legal order, and of the culture of fair play for which it is known”.
The 42-year-old Lebanese-origin lawyer went on: “However, very sadly, it has now become untenable for me, as Special Envoy, to urge other states to respect and enforce international obligations while the UK declares that it does not intend to do so itself.

“As the President of the Bar Council of England and Wales has affirmed, undermining the rule of law that ‘this country is built on... will fatally puncture people’s faith in our justice system’. And it threatens to embolden autocratic regimes that violate international law with devastating consequences all over the world….
“In these circumstances I have been dismayed to learn that the Government intends to pass legislation — the Internal Market Bill — which would, by the Government’s own admission, ‘break international law’ if enacted.”
“I was also concerned to note the position taken by the Government that although it is an ‘established principle of international law that a state is obliged to discharge its treaty obligations in good faith’, the UK’s ‘Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK’s Treaty obligations’.” ",world
America’s truth is without Ruth now," Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court and a pioneering advocate for women’s rights, who in her ninth decade became a much younger generation’s unlikely cultural icon, died at her home in Washington on Friday. She was 87.
The cause was complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
A fierce political battle shaped up over the future of the US Supreme Court on Saturday, with President Donald Trump saying he would quickly name a successor to Ginsburg, a move that would tip the court further to the Right.
Trump’s short list of potential nominees includes two women jurists: Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa, according to a source close to the White House. Ginsburg’s death has potentially shifted the focus away from the coronavirus pandemic and the stagnant economy into a political battle over her successor.
The sudden vacancy means the November election has become much more than a battle between Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden for the White House and control of Congress, political strategists say.

Now, they say, it is an existential fight over civil rights, abortion, immigration, and the future of health care for millions of Americans.
Barely five feet tall and weighing 45kg, Justice Ginsburg drew comments for years on her fragile appearance. But she was tough, working out regularly with a trainer.
As Justice Ginsburg passed her 80th birthday and 20th anniversary on the Supreme Court bench during President Barack Obama’s second term, she shrugged off a chorus of calls for her to retire in order to give a Democratic President the chance to name her replacement.
When Justice Sandra Day O’Connor retired in January 2006, Justice Ginsburg was for a time the only woman on the Supreme Court — hardly a testament to the revolution in the legal status of women that she had helped bring about in her career as a litigator and strategist. Eventually she was joined by two other women, both named by Obama: Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elena Kagan in 2010.
After the 2010 retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, whom Justice Kagan succeeded, Justice Ginsburg became the senior member and de facto leader of a four-justice liberal bloc, consisting of the three female justices and Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
Justice Ginsburg’s pointed and powerful dissenting opinions, usually speaking for all four, attracted growing attention as the court turned further to the Right. A law student, Shana Knizhnik, anointed her the Notorious R.B.G., a play on the name of the Notorious B.I.G., a famous rapper who was Brooklyn-born, like the justice.
Soon the name, and Justice Ginsburg’s image — her expression serene yet severe, a frilly lace collar adorning her black judicial robe, her eyes framed by oversize glasses and a gold crown perched at a rakish angle on her head — became an Internet sensation.
Young women had the image tattooed on their arms; daughters were dressed in R.B.G. costumes for Halloween. “You Can’t Spell Truth Without Ruth” appeared on bumper stickers and T-shirts. A biography, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, by Irin Carmon and Knizhnik, reached the best-seller list the day after its publication in 2015, and the next year Simon & Schuster brought out a Ginsburg biography for children with the title I Dissent.
A documentary film of her life was a surprise box office hit in the summer of 2018, and a Hollywood biopic centred on her first sex discrimination court case opened on Christmas Day that year.
The adulation accelerated after the election of Trump, whom Justice Ginsburg had had the indiscretion to call “a faker” in an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign. (She later said her comment had been “ill advised”.)
Her late-life rock stardom could not remotely have been predicted in June 1993, when President Bill Clinton nominated the soft-spoken, 60-year-old judge.
As lawyer, Ginsburg had argued cases that were to become legal landmarks. She presented six cases to the court from 1973 to 1978, winning five. Her goal was to persuade the Supreme Court that the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection applied not only to racial discrimination but to sex discrimination as well.
There was a successful challenge to an Idaho law that gave men preference over women to be chosen to administer estates. There was a case challenging a military regulation that denied husbands of women in the military some of the benefits to which wives of male soldiers were entitled.
Another case challenged a Social Security provision that assumed wives were secondary breadwinners whose incomes were unimportant to the family and therefore deprived widowers of survivor benefits. In that 1975 case, as in several others, the plaintiff was a man.
Nearly 20 years after making her last argument before the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg announced the court’s majority opinion in a 1996 discrimination case involving the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington. By a lopsided 7 to 1, the court had found that the all-male admissions policy of a state-supported military college was unconstitutional.
It was during that 2006-7 Supreme Court term that Justice Ginsburg’s powerful dissenting voice emerged. Another decision that term provoked another strong dissent. The court voted 5 to 4 in the case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to reject a woman’s pay discrimination claim on the grounds that the woman, Lilly Ledbetter, had not filed her complaint within the statutory 180-day deadline. The majority opinion held that the 180-day clock had started running with Ledbetter’s first paycheque reflecting the management’s decision to pay her less than it paid the men in the same job.
Justice Ginsburg objected to that, properly interpreted, the 180-period began only when an employee actually learned about the discrimination. Congress should make this clear, she wrote, declaring: “The ball is in Congress’s court.” It worked. Congress voted to overturn what Justice Ginsburg called the court’s “parsimonious reading” of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On January 29, 2009, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first bill that Obama signed into law.
It was her dissents, particularly those she announced from the bench that received the most attention. Playing along with her crowd, she took to switching the decorative collars she wore with her judicial robe on days when she would be announcing a dissent. She even wore her “dissenting collar”, which one observer described as “resembling a piece of medieval armour”, the day after Trump’s election.

Danish TV show strips down body shaming for kids," “OK, children, does anyone have a question?” the TV show’s host, Jannik Schow, asked. Only a few in the audience of 11 to 13-year-olds raised their hands. “Remember, you can’t do anything wrong,” he said. “There are no bad questions.”
You can’t blame the children if their thoughts were elsewhere. On a stage before them in a heated studio in Copenhagen stood five adults in bathrobes. There was a brief moment of silence, as faces turned serious. Having discussed it for days before in school, the children knew what was coming next. Schow gave a little nod, and the adults cast off their robes.
Facing the children, and the cameras, they stood completely naked, like statues, with their hands and arms folded behind their backs.
And so began a recording of the latest episode of an award-winning Danish children’s programme, Ultra Strips Down, which is shown on Ultra, the on-demand children’s channel of the national broadcaster, DR The topic today: skin and hair.
The show’s producers say the programme is meant as an educational tool to fight body shaming and encourage body positivity. And so first reluctantly, later enthusiastically, the children from the Orestad School in Copenhagen asked the adults questions like: “At what age did you grow hair on the lower part of your body?” “Do you consider removing your tattoos?” “Are you pleased with your private parts?”

One of the adults, Martin, answered that he had never had “negative thoughts” about his private parts. Another adult, also named Martin, admitted that when he was young he had worried about size. “But the relationship with myself has changed over time,” he said. With serious looks on their faces, the children nodded.
Schow, 29, who helped develop the concept of the show after a producer came up with the idea, said the point was also to counter the daily bombardment of young people with images of perfect — unrealistic — bodies. The adults are not actors, but volunteers.
“This is how we educate our children,” said Sofie Münster, a nationally recognised expert in “Nordic Parenting”. “We show them reality as it is.”
Asked during the programme on skin and hair why she decided to take part, one of the adults, Ule, 76, said she wanted to show the children that perfect bodies were rare and that what they see on social media is often misleading. “On Facebook or Instagram, many people are fashion models,” she said. “Us here, we have ordinary bodies. I hope you will understand that normal bodies look like this,” she told the audience, pointing at her naked self.
Shame of being imperfect comes from social media, Schow said. “Ninety per cent of the bodies you see on social media are perfect, but that is not how 90 per cent of the world looks,” he said. “We have extra fat, or hair, or pimples. We want to show children from an early age that this is fine.”
The recorded episodes feature adults with different body types — white, Black, fat, thin, short, tall, old and young. There was John, a person with dwarfism, and Muffe, a man who had small horns implanted under the skin of his bald head. Complete inclusiveness is one of the show’s key objectives, which is why the children were also introduced to Rei, who is transgender, had a vasectomy and testosterone treatment.
After the show, three children sat cross-legged in the grass outside the TV studio to discuss the experience. 
“It was funny,” said Theodore Knightley, 11. “I liked the advice they gave us.” Sonya Chakrabarthy Geckler, 11, said she hadn’t been sure what to expect. But, she said, she “felt more confident about her own body now”.

Taiwan scrambles jet amid China drill," Taiwan scrambled fighter jets on Friday as 18 Chinese aircraft buzzed the island, crossing the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, in response to a senior US official holding talks in Taipei.
China had earlier announced combat drills and denounced what it called collusion between the island, which it claims as part of its territory, and the US.
US undersecretary for economic affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior state department official to come to Taiwan in four decades — to which China had promised a “necessary response”.
Beijing has watched with growing alarm the ever-closer relationship between Taipei and Washington, and has stepped up military exercises near the island, including two days of large-scale air and sea drills last week.
Taiwan said 18 Chinese aircraft were involved on Friday, far more than in previous such encounters.

“Sep. 18, two H-6 bombers, eight J-16 fighters, four J-10 fighters and four J-11 fighters crossed the midline of the TaiwanStrait and entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ,” the defence ministry said in an English-language tweet.
“ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities.” The ROCAF is Taiwan’s air force.
In Beijing, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Friday’s manoeuvres, about which he gave no details, involved the People’s Liberation Army’s eastern theatre command. “They are a reasonable, necessary action aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait and protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ren said.",world
Covid: Europe allows second low-cost drug," Europe’s health regulator has endorsed using dexamethasone to treat severely ill Covid-19 patients with breathing difficulty, paving the way for the steroidal medication to possibly become the region’s second approved medication for the illness.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Friday concluded in its review of results from a trial by British scientists that the drug could be an option to treat adults and adolescents needing oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.
Gilead’s antiviral drug, remdesivir, was the first to be approved for Covid-19 by Europe in July, a month after the EMA endorsed the drug.
Companies that sell the widely available and low-cost dexamethasone, commonly used against a range of inflammatory conditions, can now apply for a licence on the expanded use to their national regulators or the EMA, the watchdog said.

Covid positive pregnant women have higher risk factors," Pregnant women who are infected with the coronavirus and hospitalised are at risk for developing serious complications, and may face an elevated risk for delivering their babies prematurely, according to new studies from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. They may also be at greater risk of losing the pregnancy or having a stillbirth.
The troubling findings are consistent with some earlier reports that pregnant women may be at increased risk for severe illness when they become infected with the new coronavirus. But some experts warned that the findings, drawn from relatively small numbers of patients, including many hospitalised because of Covid-19, may not be representative of all pregnant women who are infected.
The studies found that many hospitalised pregnant women who were infected with the virus did not have any symptoms. Among those who did have symptoms, however, between 16 per cent and 30 per cent required intensive care, and 6 per cent to 8.5 per cent required ventilators to help with breathing. Among the 703 cases described in the two reports, three died.
Both studies found that pregnant women infected with the coronavirus experienced a higher rate of preterm deliveries than expected, and some had stillbirths. 
The immune system is suppressed during pregnancy, a response designed to prevent adverse reactions to the foetus but one that increases susceptibility to viral infections. The lungs may be affected by the expanding uterus, and the cardiovascular system is working harder. Covid-19 can also raise the risks of blood clots, and little is known about effects on the placenta.

"TikTok, WeChat locked out of US app stores"," The Donald Trump administration said on Friday that it would bar the Chinese-owned mobile apps WeChat and TikTok from US app stores as of Sunday, striking a harsh blow against two popular services used by more than 100 million people in the US.
Both apps are among the over 200 mobile applications already banned by the Indian government in the aftermath of the heightened border tensions with China in Ladakh. 
The restrictions will ban the transferring of funds or processing of payments through WeChat within the US as of Sunday. In the case of WeChat, the restrictions will also prevent any company from offering Internet hosting, content delivery networks, Internet transit or peering services to WeChat, or using the app’s code in other software or services in the US.

Those same prohibitions on providing services go into effect on November 12 for TikTok.
“Today’s actions prove once again that President Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party,” commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
The actions follow an August 6 executive order by the President, in which he argued that TikTok and WeChat collect data from American users that could be accessed by the Chinese government. The administration has threatened fines of up to $1 million and up to 20 years in prison for violations of the order.
TikTok is currently in talks to be acquired by the American software maker Oracle, and could announce a deal that assuages the administration’s national security concerns. In its announcement, the commerce department said that the President had given until November 12 for TikTok’s national security concerns to be resolved, and if they were, the prohibitions in the order could be lifted.
TikTok said in a statement: “We disagree with the decision from the Commerce Department, and are disappointed that it stands to block new app downloads from Sunday and ban use of the TikTok app in the US from Nov. 12. We will continue to challenge the unjust executive order, which was enacted without due process and threatens to deprive the American people and small businesses across the US of a significant platform for both a voice and livelihoods.”
Tencent and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ross, in an interview on Fox Business Network on Friday morning, said that the ban would initially have a much greater impact on WeChat.
“For all practical purposes it will be shut down in the US, but only in the US, as of midnight Monday,” Ross said.
TikTok would also face some changes, but would still be allowed to function until November 12, Ross said, at which point it would face the same ban as WeChat if there was no deal that satisfied the administration’s concerns. “As to TikTok, the only real change as of Sunday night will be users won’t have access to improved updated apps, upgraded apps or maintenance,” he said.
The prohibitions raise the question of whether Google and Apple, the major operators of American app stores, could sue the administration.

Facebook to no longer show health group recommendations," Facebook Inc will no longer show health groups in its recommendations, the social media giant announced on Thursday, saying it was crucial that people get health information from “authoritative sources”.
Over the last year, the company took down more than 1 million groups that violated Facebook’s policies on misinformation and harmful content, it said in a blog post.
Misleading health content has racked up an estimated 3.8 billion views on Facebook over the past year, peaking during the coronavirus pandemic, advocacy group Avaaz said in a report.
Facebook, under pressure to curb such misinformation on its platform, has made amplifying credible health information a key element of its response. It also removes certain false claims about Covid-19 that it determines could cause imminent harm.
The world’s largest social network also said it would bar administrators and moderators of groups that have been taken down for policy violations from creating any new groups for a period of time.

Chinese targeting India in US hack net," The US justice department has charged five Chinese citizens with hacking over a 100 companies and institutions in America and abroad, including the Indian government’s networks, and stealing valuable software data and business intelligence. 
Deputy US attorney-general Jeffrey Rosen on Wednesday announced three indictments have been unsealed that collectively charge five Chinese nationals with computer hacking and two Malaysian nationals for helping some of those hackers target victims and sell the fruits of their crime.
“The department of justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer intrusions and cyber attacks by these Chinese citizens. Regrettably, the Chinese Communist Party has chosen a different path — of making China safe for cyber-criminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal intellectual property helpful to China,” Rosen said. 
“In about 2019, the conspirators compromised Government of lndia websites, as well as virtual private networks and database servers supporting the Government of India. The conspirators used VPS PROVIDER servers to connect to an Open VPN network owned by the Government of India,” the indictment said. In the attacks, the conspirators installed “Cobalt Strike” malware on Indian government-protected computers, it added.",world
Covid: Moderna eyes 70% vaccine efficacy," If Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine proves to be at least 70 per cent effective, the company plans to seek emergency authorisation for its use in high-risk groups, the company’s chief executive Stephane Bancel told Reuters.
Moderna’s vaccine candidate — mRNA-1273 — is nearing the finish line in its push to enroll 30,000 individuals in a late-stage trial of a novel coronavirus vaccine. But the company may be able to declare victory early if it is able to show that people who got the vaccine fared much better in its trial that people who didn’t.
Vaccines must demonstrate they are at least 50 per cent more effective than a placebo to be considered for approval. To prove that, government officials have said, at least 150 Covid-19 infections must be recorded among trial participants with at least twice as many occurring among the placebo group.
An independent safety board will take a first look at Moderna’s data as soon as a total of 53 people in the trial become infected with Covid-19. Moderna is projecting the interim analysis will occur in November, but it could come as early as October. If most of the people who got sick got the placebo shot, that would indicate the vaccine was protecting those inoculated and could be enough evidence to seek US regulatory approval for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
“If the interim readout is deemed by the independent safety committee as positive with 70 or 80 or 90 per cent efficacy, we will indeed consider approval,” Bancel said. “At such a level of efficacy, if we get there, we can protect a lot of lives…,” Bancel said.

Savile Row Decks up for women for first time," For more than 200 years, Savile Row in London’s elegant Mayfair district has been the place to go for discerning men in search of the perfect, tailor-made suit.
Now, for the first time, a tailoring house has opened on the storied street that offers made-to-measure suits exclusively for women.
“We’re called The Deck because it’s about reshuffling the deck,” said founder Daisy Knatchbull. “We are the first tailoring house to focus on women to have a shopfront on Savile Row,” which she described as a very male-dominated environment.
“So things are changing,” she said. “Suits for women isn’t just a trend. It’s here to stay.”
Knatchbull opened her business in 2019 in affluent Chelsea, further west, but when an opportunity came up to move to Savile Row she felt it was too good to pass up, despite the dire economic circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Yes, I know it seems a strange time,” she said. “If you want to win big you back big, right?”

“This is the place to come for the best tailoring in the world, and it’s known worldwide. And so the prestige of this street, it’s an amazing thing to be able to be a part of that.”
The Deck is aiming squarely at the luxury market, with suits starting at 2,200 pounds ($2,850) and prices varying depending on the fabric. An all-female staff of tailors is on hand for fittings.
“What you’re getting, you’re investing in quality and durability and longevity, and all these great things that move towards more slow-mo fashion rather than fast fashion,” said Knatchbull.
Asked whether she was concerned about a shrinking market for business suits, given the high number of white-collar professionals working from home, Knatchbull said suits were not limited to the workplace.",world
"Endangered, now wiped out by fire"," The fast-moving fires that swept through western US have wiped out critical populations of endangered species and incinerated native habitats that may take years to recover, if they recover at all.
Fire is a critical part of ecosystems in the west, and many plants and animals depend on it to thrive, but the heat and intensity of the wildfires now ravaging California, Oregon, Washington and other western states are so destructive that wildlife in some areas may struggle to recover.
“Some of these places we set aside may be fundamentally impacted by climate change and may not be able to come back,” said Amy Windrope, deputy director of Washington’s department of fish and wildlife. “That’s just a reality.”
With millions of acres across the west blackened by fire, the impact on humans has been clear: Lives lost, tens of thousands of people forced to flee their homes, possessions and livelihoods destroyed, and state and federal fire fighting resources have been stretched beyond the limit.
Residents are even beginning to question whether the changing fire danger will make their hometowns too dangerous to inhabit. Less obvious is the long-term impact to native species.
Wildlife officials all over the west are grappling with how to respond now that the existence of habitats set aside for threatened species appear to be imperilled by megafires made worse by climate change.
“It’s important to make the connection between what’s happening now and climate change,” said Davia Palmeri, policy coordinator for the Oregon department of fish and wildlife. “We now have to think about climate change when managing wildlife.”
Fire that raced through the sagebrush steppe country of central Washington this month destroyed several state wildlife areas, leaving little more than bare ground. The flames killed about half of the state’s endangered population of pygmy rabbits, leaving only about 50 of the palm-sized rabbits in the wild there.
“It’s just heartbreaking,” Windrope said. “We have very little sage brush habitat left for them, and it will take decades for this land to recover.”
The fires also destroyed critical breeding grounds for endangered sage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse, and officials estimate the fast-moving flames may have wiped out 30 to 70 per cent of the birds. The survivors are left without the critical brush cover they need to raise young.
Fire is common in central Oregon, but the intensity of the fires this month has not been seen in generations, said Molly Linville, whose family has ranched in Douglas County, Washington, for nearly a century. 
Ranchers in the area were unable to get cattle out of the way and many died. On the range they found deer and other wildlife staggering around, severely burned.
“One neighbour girl found a porcupine who had all his quills burned off. It took the longest time to even figure out what it was,” she said. “They took it in and I think it’s going to be OK, but the land — it’s going to take years to come back.”
In Oregon, the fires have largely raged in western pine forests, prompting different concerns.
Several endangered and threatened species, including the northern spotted owl and the weasel-like pine marten, depend on the mature mountain forests that bore the brunt of the fires.
“It’s too soon to tell the impact,” Palmeri said. Birds can fly out of harm’s way, animals can seek refuge underground, but some wildlife may return to find the old-growth forests they rely on gone.
The impact of hundreds of thousands of acres of barren slopes may spread well 
beyond the fires’ reach and remain once the flames are out. The Oregon department of fish and wildlife is bracing for winter rains that could wash ash and silt into local streams and impact endangered salmon.",world
China-wary US to arm Taiwan," The US plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones, to Taiwan, four people familiar with the discussions said, as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China.
Pursuing seven sales at once is a rare departure from years of precedent in which US military sales to the island were spaced out and carefully calibrated to minimise tensions with Beijing.
But the Trump administration has become more aggressive with China in 2020 and the sales would land as relations between Beijing and Washington are at their lowest point in decades over accusations of spying, a lingering trade war and disputes about the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Taiwan’s desire to buy weapons increased after President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected in January and has made strengthening Taiwan’s defences a top priority.
Taiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing says it is a Chinese province, and has denounced the Trump administration’s support for the island.

Washington has been eager to create a military counterbalance to Chinese forces, building on an effort known within the Pentagon as “Fortress Taiwan”, as Beijing’s military makes increasingly aggressive moves in the region.
The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US did not respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan’s military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly US-made hardware, but China has a huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment of its own.

Harvard University race bias hearing," A federal appeals court on Wednesday will consider whether Harvard University discriminates against Asian-American applicants in a closely watched case that could impact whether US colleges can use race as a factor in admissions.
The first US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston will hear arguments in a lawsuit brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a non-profit founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, and backed by the Trump administration.
The group sued Harvard in 2014, claiming it illegally engages in “racial balancing” that artificially limits the number of Asian-American students at the Ivy League school. Harvard denies the allegation and says it is legally promoting student body diversity in keeping with Supreme Court precedent.
Conservatives have long criticised affirmative action. The US justice department under President Donald Trump has backed SFFA, arguing in a “friend of the court” brief that Harvard “actively engages in racial balancing that Supreme Court precedent flatly forbids”.",world
Dinosaur skeleton auction," The British auction house Christie’s plans to sell the skeleton of one of the largest known Tyrannosaurus rexes in early October, the company said on Wednesday.
The dinosaur known as “STAN”, approximately 67 million years old, was discovered in 1987 in South Dakota by amateur paleontologist Stan Sacrison.
“He showed it to scientists at the time who unfortunately misidentified it as a triceratops,” James Hyslop, Christie’s head of science and natural history, told Reuters.
STAN is 40 feet long and 13 feet high, Christie’s said. He is also notable for two fused vertebrae scientists have identified in his neck, suggesting the dinosaur broke his neck and survived during his lifetime.
Christie’s will display the dinosaur from Wednesday to mid-October at its Manhattan, New York, location, the company said. It plans to book socially distant viewings for the public.

"New Japan Prime Minister, old team"," Japan’s Yoshihide Suga was voted Prime Minister by Parliament on Wednesday to become the country’s first new leader in nearly eight years, appointing a new cabinet that kept about half of the familiar faces from predecessor Shinzo Abe’s line-up.
Suga, 71, Abe’s longtime right-hand man, has pledged to pursue many of Abe’s programmes, including his “Abenomics” economic strategy, and to forge ahead with structural reforms, including deregulation and shutting down bureaucratic turf battles.
Abe, Japan’s longest-serving Premier, resigned because of ill health after nearly eight years in office. Suga served under him in the pivotal post of chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman and coordinating policies.
Suga, who won a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race by a landslide on Monday, faces a plethora of challenges, including tackling Covid-19 while reviving a battered economy and dealing with a rapidly aging society.
With little direct diplomatic experience, Suga must also cope with an intensifying US-China confrontation, build ties with the winner of the November 3 US presidential election and try to keep Japan’s own relations with Beijing on track.

About half of the new cabinet are carryovers from Abe’s administration. Only two are women and the average age, including Suga, is 60.

People flock to hospitals with breathing problems," The billowing wildfire smoke that has blanketed much of the West Coast with a caustic haze also began settling into the atmosphere thousands of miles away on Tuesday.
While more favourable weather has allowed firefighters to make some progress against the devastating blazes in Oregon, the crisis was far from over: The largest fires were still mostly uncontained, the air has been some of the most polluted on the planet for a week, and the state was setting up a mobile morgue as crews continued to sift through the rubble for missing people.
In California, where 25 people have died this year and 3.2 million acres — a modern record — have burned, officials had both successes and setbacks: Firefighters there contained two fires, one in Yuba County and the other north of Willits, and were trying to suppress 33 new blazes as stiff winds in the northeast pushed fires into new territory. There was still no significant rain in sight, and lands parched by warm weather remain at risk of igniting.
At the North Complex Fire, which has burned more than 270,000 acres northeast of Sacramento, winds whipped the flames across a clearing that had been plowed by bulldozers.
Captain Michael McIndoe and his crew were trying to stamp out any embers crossing a road. “It’s really challenging to stop it,” said Captain McIndoe, who was sent north by the Los Angeles fire department to join the fight.

Crews back in Los Angeles were working on Tuesday to beat back one wildfire that approached to within 500 feet of the famed Mt Wilson Observatory, according to the US Forest Service.
West Coast residents from San Francisco to Seattle and beyond have for days suffered from the smoke, which has sent air-quality readings soaring to hazardous levels, closed some schools and led officials to shut parks and beaches while pleading for people to stay indoors. In Seattle, Harborview Medical Centre reported seeing a rise in the number of people seeking help for breathing issues — many of them people with underlying conditions such as asthma or lung disease.
“The air outside right now is at historically polluted levels,” governor Jay Inslee of Washington said.
Air that was considered unhealthy to breathe was recorded as far away as Montana and up into Canada, though the high-level haze extended much further. Propelled by the jet stream and a high-pressure system over the Great Lakes, the smoke began arriving at higher altitudes across much of the continent.
By midday on Tuesday over Washington, the sun and the sky had blurred together into one diffused and omnipresent bright light.
Brian LaSorsa, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in the Baltimore and Washington region, said he first noticed the smoke over the region on Monday, in the upper levels of the atmosphere. “Obviously we don’t see smoke very often from wildfires,” LaSorsa said.
But on the ground along the East Coast, the air quality remained clear. There was a possibility the smoke could descend, possibly later this week if a cold front comes through, LaSorsa said, but he expected it to stay aloft through Tuesday night.
The wildfires along the West Coast that are generating the atmospheric pollution had flared dramatically last week when winds whipped them into infernos that overwhelmed cities and razed hundreds of homes in Washington, Oregon and California. Wildfires have also been sparked in Idaho, where a blaze of nearly 70,000 acres near the Oregon border forced the evacuation Monday of dozens of residents and campers.
In Oregon, where tens of thousands of people have been displaced by evacuations, authorities in some areas were asking residents on Tuesday to stay away from destroyed neighbourhoods because of lingering dangers, including falling trees and rock slides along Highway 22 in Marion County.
Oregon has reported eight deaths, a number lowered from 10 after two sets of remains were identified as animals. The Oregon State Police mobilised a mobile morgue in Linn County, between Salem and Eugene, that could handle remains from wildfires across the state. Specialists were being assembled, such as those with dental expertise, to help identify the dead.

Barbados to drop Queen Elizabeth," Barbados wants to remove Britain’s Queen Elizabeth as its head of state and become a republic, the Caribbean island nation’s government has said, reviving a plan mooted several times in the past.
A former British colony that gained independence in 1966, Barbados has maintained a formal link with the British monarchy. “The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,” said Barbados governor General Sandra Mason, speaking on behalf of Prime Minister Mia Mottley.
“Barbadians want a Barbadian head of state. This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving. Hence, Barbados will take the next logical step towards full sovereignty and become a republic by the time we celebrate our 55th anniversary of independence (in November next year).”
Buckingham Palace and Britain’s foreign office said the issue was a matter for the people of Barbados.

Horrific failure in Boeing crashes: US Panel," Two Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed all 346 passengers and crew aboard were the “horrific culmination” of failures by the planemaker and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a US House panel concluded after an 18-month investigation.
The crashes “were not the result of a singular failure, technical mistake, or mismanaged event”, the House transportation and infrastructure committee’s democratic majority said in its highly critical report released on Wednesday.
“They were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing’s management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.”
The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 near Addis Ababa, which killed all 157 aboard.
In October 2018, a Lion Air 737 MAX had crashed in Indonesia killing all 189 on board.

“Boeing failed in its design and development of the MAX, and the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft,” the report said, detailing a series of problems in the plane’s design and the FAA’s approval of it.
Boeing said it “learned many hard lessons as a company from the accidents... and from the mistakes we have made”.
It said it had cooperated fully with the House committee and that revised design work on the 737 MAX had received intensive internal and external review involving more than 375,000 engineering and testing hours and 1,300 test flights.
The FAA said it would work with lawmakers “to implement improvements identified in its report”. It added it was “focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organisation, processes and culture”.
The report said Boeing made “faulty design and performance assumptions” especially regarding a key safety system, called MCAS, which was linked to both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.
MCAS, which was designed to help counter a tendency of the MAX to pitch up, could be activated after data from only a single sensor.
The FAA is requiring new safeguards to MCAS, including requiring it to receive data from two sensors, before it allows the 737 MAX to return to service.
The report criticised Boeing for withholding “crucial information from the FAA, its customers, and 737 MAX pilots” including “concealing the very existence of MCAS from 737 MAX pilots.”
The FAA “failed to ensure the safety of the travelling public”, the report said.
Lawmakers have proposed numerous reforms to restructure how the FAA oversees aircraft certification. A Senate committee will take up a reform bill on Wednesday.
Lawmakers suggested Boeing was motivated to cut costs and move quickly to get the 737 MAX to market.

Facebook ‘fails fake news fight’," While Facebook has heralded improvements to its fight against disinformation in the US, it has been slow to deal with fake accounts that have affected elections around the world, according to a post published by a former employee.
The employee, who worked on a Facebook team dedicated to rooting out so-called inauthentic activity on the service, said executives ignored or were slow to react to her repeated warnings about the problem.
“In the three years I’ve spent at Facebook, I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry,” Sophie Zhang, the employee, wrote in a 6,600-word post shared with the entire company on her final day on the job.
As countries like Russia, China and Iran have continued sophisticated disinformation operations, Zhang’s post has drawn attention to smaller countries that run cheap and easy bot networks to influence their citizens. In one example, bots promoted the President of Honduras. In another, they attacked Opposition figures in Azerbaijan.
Facebook’s failure to root out the bots, or automated accounts, operating on behalf of political figures raises questions for how effectively the company can police a platform used by over 2.7 billion people.

Zhang was fired in August, and left the company in early September. In her post, she speculated that part of the reason she lost her job at Facebook was because she neglected the routine duties of her work to focus on the political activity by the false accounts.
In response to Zhang’s post, Facebook said the company regularly removed coordinated influence campaigns.
“Working against coordinated inauthentic behaviour is our priority, but we’re also addressing the problems of spam and fake engagement. We probe each issue carefully, including those that Zhang raises, before we take action.”",world
Vaccine will be ready by November: China," A senior Chinese health official said a coronavirus vaccine could be available to the public in China as early as November, the state news media reported on Tuesday.
Dr Wu Guizhen, the chief expert for biosafety at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state broadcaster CCTV that “ordinary people” in China could be given the vaccine in November or December.
“Current progress has been very smooth” for vaccine candidates in the final stage of clinical trials, she said.
China now has five vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials, including one being developed in collaboration with other countries, Dr Wu said. Two production factories have been approved for manufacturing, and a third is in the approval process, she said. China, the world’s largest vaccine producer, has put the prospect of a Covid-19 vaccine at the centre of a diplomatic charm offensive.
China has already approved at least two experimental vaccines under an emergency use programme, which began this summer with soldiers and employees of state-owned companies and has quietly expanded to include health care workers.

Trump again pours scorn on science," With wildfires raging across the west, climate change took centre stage in the race for the White House on Monday as former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr called President Trump a “climate arsonist” while the President said that “I don’t think science knows” what is actually happening.
A day of duelling appearances laid out the stark differences between the two candidates, an incumbent President who has long scorned climate change as a hoax and rolled back environmental regulations and a challenger who has called for an aggressive campaign to curb the greenhouse gases blamed for increasingly extreme weather.
Trump flew to California after weeks of public silence about the flames that have forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, wiped out communities and forests, burned millions of acres, shrouded the region in smoke and left at least 27 people dead. But even when confronted by California’s governor and other state officials, the president insisted on attributing the crisis solely to poor forest management, not climate change.
Biden, for his part, assailed Trump’s record on the climate, asserting that the President’s inaction and denial had fed destruction, citing not just the current emergency on the West Coast but flooding in the Midwest and hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. In an outdoor speech at a museum in Wilmington, Delaware, the Democratic presidential nominee sought to paint a second Trump term as a danger to the nation’s suburbs, flipping an attack on him by the President.
“If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” Biden asked. “How many suburban neighbourhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms? If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?”
The politicking came as firefighting teams across the West Coast battled shifting winds and drier weather on Monday, sparking additional fire fronts that threatened to make new kindling out of forests and cover more of the country with hazardous smoke and falling ash.
By Monday afternoon, haze had spread across much of the US and could be seen over New York and Washington.
Heavy smoke kept some firefighting aircraft grounded as fire pushed into new areas, prompting fresh evacuations in Idaho, Oregon and California.

Activist groups accuse China of Uighur genocide," Nearly two dozen activist groups said on Tuesday that crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place against Uighurs in China's remote Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps.
The spokesperson's office at the Chinese foreign ministry said it had not seen the letter, but rejected such allegations as“sensational topics concocted by some anti-China forces, a farcical attempt to smear and discredit China”.
China equally protects the legitimate rights and interests of ethnic minorities, it said. China has said the camps are vocational education and training centres as part of counter-terrorism and deradicalisation measures.
The open letter signed by groups including the U.S.-based Uighur Human Rights Project and Genocide Watch calls on the United Nations Human Rights Council to launch an investigation.
""The atrocities include arbitrary detention of between 1 and 1.8 million people in internment camps, a widespread program of political indoctrination, enforced disappearances, destruction of cultural sites, forced labour, disproportionate rates of prison incarceration, and coercive birth prevention campaigns and policies,” it said.

Under international law, crimes against humanity are defined as widespread and systematic, whereas the burden of proof of genocide - the intent to destroy part of a population - is more difficult to prove.
""These measures meet the threshold of acts constitutive of genocide, core international crimes under the Genocide Convention, which prohibits 'imposing measures intended to prevent births' among an ethnic or religious group,” the groups said.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday she was discussing a possible visit to Xinjiang with Chinese authorities.
But activists voiced disappointment in her speech to the Human Rights Council.
""Bachelet's remarks on China say nothing of substance - no word about the human costs of China's rights violations, including against Uighurs and in Hong Kong, nor the ongoing concerns about free expression, arbitrary detention and crackdowns on civil society,” Sarah Brooks of the International Service for Human Rights told Reuters.
""Instead, the remarks speak volumes about the weak position of the human rights office vis-Ã -vis China,” she said.
The United States on Monday shelved plans for a broad import ban on cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang while announcing narrower bans on products from five specific entities.
 U.S. officials said the measures were aimed at combating China's use of forced labour by detained Uighur Muslims.",world
"World looking at India for large-scale vaccine production, says Bill Gates","   Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has said India's willingness to play a ""big role"" in manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine and allowing it to supply to other developing countries will be a critical part in containing the pandemic globally.
In an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, Gates, whose foundation is focusing on fighting the pandemic, called it the ""next biggest thing"" the world has been confronted with after the World War.
The Microsoft co-founder said the world is looking up to India for large scale production of Covid-19 vaccine once it rolls out.
Obviously, all of us want to get a vaccine out in India as fast as we can, once we know that it's very effective and very safe, and so the plans are coming into focus that sometime next year, it's very likely that roll-out will take place and take place in a fairly big volume,"" he said.

""The world is expecting India to make some of that vaccine available to other developing countries. Exactly what that allocation formula looks like will have to be figured out,"" Gates added.
Scientists and pharmaceutical companies globally are racing against time to find a vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic which has killed about 9,32,000 people and infected around 24 million. Some of the vaccine candidates have entered the third and final phase of testing.
""This is not like a world war, but it's the next biggest thing after that that we've ever had,"" he said.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's largest charities, has been involved in global efforts to contain the pandemic. In India, the foundation has entered into a partnership with the Serum Institute to accelerate the manufacturing and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines.
""India will be helping to make sure we have equity. We have a model that shows that getting the vaccine out to those who need it the most will save half the lives that you'd lose if you only send it out to the rich countries,"" he said.
In the telephonic interview, the Microsoft co-founder, who has donated billions of dollars to fight poverty and diseases, talked extensively about India's strength in production of vaccines and referred to companies like Serum Institute, Bio E and Bharat Biotech.
""We've been brokering the idea of taking a vaccine and manufacturing it in India, even if it comes from AstraZeneca, Oxford or Novavax or Johnson & Johnson. We've publicly talked about the arrangement where a Serum will be able to make very high volume of the AstraZeneca and the Novavax vaccine,"" said Gates.
""There's discussions with Bio E, their connection with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and whether they'll be able to ramp that up,"" he said.
Gates also said that the foundation has been having ""great discussions"" with India's NITI-Aayog, adding the ICMR is looking at the regulatory aspects of the Covid-19 vaccines.
""I'm actually very impressed with how our discussions with the government on these issues and the companies, including the Western companies collaborating with these new companies, that's all gone very well,"" Gates said.
The American business magnate said he was optimistic that by the first quarter of next year, that several of these vaccines will reach the phase three emergency licence approval.
""We still could be disappointed in that. But we have a variety of constructs and the early data from the phase one and phase two, for example the antibody levels, looks pretty promising for quite a few of these vaccines,"" he said.
He said the focus should be to keep the cost of the vaccines low and it should be ensured that they can be made in very high volume.
""We have to remember that even once a vaccine is approved, the bar for that vaccine in terms of the effectiveness was set as 50 per cent, and so we still may want to continue with other vaccines to get higher effectiveness,"" he said.
Gates also complimented India's digital cash transfer scheme.
""Getting payments out through digital cash transfers, that has been a fantastic thing, and obviously, India has done that at a scale that no other country ever has,"" he said.
""The whole Aadhaar digital financial system in India has proven to be once again a huge asset,"" he said, adding it can be extended to all the countries of the world.
The philanthropist also referred to the foundation's annual Goalkeepers report saying it normally takes stock of the ongoing progress on things like economic growth, literacy, child survival and average lifespan.
""This year's report, unfortunately, we're unable to say that there's been progress. In fact, we talk about the setback, and one way we dimensionalise that for like vaccine coverage globally, which went from 84 per cent to 70 per cent, is we say that's a 25-year setback,"" he said.
Asked whether India's economic downturn will impact implementation of social welfare schemes, Gates said the foundation is a huge believer that investments in health pay off very strongly.
""It's tragic that all health activities have been so disrupted, and that will lead to increased deaths from other diseases, not just Covid,"" he said.
""In fact, in many places, and I'm not sure if India will be included in this, but there's a chance that there would be more deaths from other diseases because of the health disruption than from Covid itself,"" he said.

"Trump: If Biden wins, the mob wins"," President Donald Trump held a Nevada campaign rally at an indoor venue on Sunday despite public health professionals' warnings against large indoor gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump, a Republican, railed against his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, suggesting he was taking drugs and was soft on crime. “Biden wants to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists,” 
Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd. “If Biden wins, the mob wins.”
People in the crowd were seated close together and many did not wear masks.
Biden has criticised Trump for holding campaign events that put people at risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Hang rapists in public: Imran," Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday he would like convicted rapists to be publicly executed or chemically castrated, reacting to a question on the rape of a woman on a highway last week that has caused uproar.
Last week, a mother of two driving along a major highway near Lahore was dragged out of her car and raped by two men at gunpoint — one of whom was arrested by police on Monday.
Khan said he believed the culprits should be hanged publicly, but added that officials had informed him that such an act could endanger a preferential trade status given to Pakistan by the EU. However, Khan said he was also looking into the option of chemical castration instead, he said during an interview on a Pakistan news channel. ",world

TikTok chooses Oracle as US partner," The Chinese owner of TikTok has chosen Oracle to be the app’s technology partner for its US operations and has rejected an acquisition offer from Microsoft, according to Microsoft officials and other people involved in the negotiations, as time runs out on an executive order from President Trump threatening to ban the popular app unless its American operations are sold.
It was unclear whether TikTok’s choice of Oracle as a technology partner would mean that Oracle would also take a majority ownership stake of the social media app, the people involved in the negotiations said. Microsoft had been seen as the American technology company with the deepest pockets to buy TikTok’s US operations from its parent company, ByteDance, and with the greatest ability to address national security concerns that led to Trump’s order.
“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,” Microsoft said in a statement. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests.”
ByteDance declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fast-moving series of events on Sunday came as the clock ticks down on the executive order from Trump, which said that TikTok essentially needed to strike a deal to sell its US operations by September 20 or risk being blocked in the US. But sale talks had been in a holding pattern because China issued new regulations last month that would bar TikTok from transferring its technology to a foreign buyer without explicit permission from the Chinese government. And any resulting deal could still be a geopolitical piñata between the US and China.

The Chinese regulations helped scuttle the bid by Microsoft. The software giant had said in August that it would insist on a series of protections that would essentially give it control of the computer code that TikTok uses for the American and many other English-speaking versions of the app.
Microsoft said the only way it could both protect the privacy of TikTok users in the US and prevent Beijing from using the app as a venue for disinformation was to take over that computer code, and the algorithms that determine what videos are seen by the 100 million Americans who use it each month.
“We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety and combating disinformation,” Microsoft said in its statement.
Oracle has said nothing publicly about what it would do with TikTok’s underlying technology, which is written by a Chinese engineering team in Beijing — and which secretary of state Mike Pompeo has charged is answerable to Chinese intelligence agencies. 
That is a major concern of American intelligence agencies, led by the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, which warned internally that whoever controls the computer code could channel — or censor — a range of politically sensitive information to specific users.
ByteDance and TikTok have denied that they help the Chinese government.
TikTok has become the latest flash point between Washington and Beijing over the control of technology that affects American lives. 
The Trump administration had already banned the Chinese telecom giant Huawei from selling next-generation, or 5G, networks and equipment in the US, citing the risk of a foreign power controlling the infrastructure on which all Internet communications flow.
But TikTok took the battle in new directions. For the first time, the US was trying to stop a Chinese cultural phenomenon, with an intense following among American teenagers and millennials, which carries with it the possibility of future influence. Even if Oracle may try to close a deal, it is unclear whether Beijing would create new obstacles to the process.
And election-year politics have hung over the negotiations from the start. Unlike many other technology companies, Oracle has cultivated close ties with the Trump administration. Its founder, Larry Ellison, hosted a fund-raiser for Trump this year, and its chief executive, Safra Catz, served on the President’s transition team and has frequently visited the White House. Last month, Trump said he would support Oracle buying TikTok.

Life on Venus? Astronomers see a signal in its clouds," High in the toxic atmosphere of the planet Venus, astronomers on Earth have discovered signs of what might be life.
If the discovery is confirmed by additional telescope observations and future space missions, it could turn the gaze of scientists toward one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Venus roasts at temperatures of hundreds of degrees and is cloaked by clouds that contain droplets of corrosive sulfuric acid. Few have focused on the rocky planet as a habitat for something living.
Instead, for decades, scientists have sought signs of life elsewhere, usually peering outward to Mars and more recently at Europa, Enceladus and other icy moons of the giant planets.
The astronomers, who reported the finding Monday in a pair of papers, have not collected specimens of Venusian microbes nor have they snapped any pictures of them. But with powerful telescopes, they have detected a chemical — phosphine — in the thick Venus atmosphere. After much analysis, the scientists assert that something now alive is the only explanation for the chemical’s source.
Some researchers question this hypothesis, and they suggest instead that the gas could result from unexplained atmospheric or geologic processes on a planet that remains mysterious. But the finding will also encourage some planetary scientists to ask whether humanity has overlooked a planet that may have once been more Earthlike than any other world in our solar system.

“This is an astonishing and ‘out of the blue’ finding,” said Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an author of the papers (one published in Nature Astronomy and another submitted to the journal Astrobiology). “It will definitely fuel more research into the possibilities for life in Venus’ atmosphere.”
Although the surface of Venus is like a blast furnace, a cloud layer just 31 miles below the top of its atmosphere may reach temperatures as low as 86 degrees Fahrenheit, and has a pressure similar to that at ground level on Earth.
In a paper published in August, Seager and her colleagues suggested that microbes borne aloft on air currents called gravity waves could live, metabolize and reproduce inside droplets of sulfuric acid and water. And given the amount of gas being produced, the population of these microbes would be ample.

"Oregon wildfires: 800km apart, same fiery grave"," They lived more than 800km from each other — one in the wooded foothills of the Sierra Nevada, northeast of California’s capital Sacramento, the other in a thickly forested canyon east of Oregon’s capital Salem.
Josiah Williams, 16.
Wyatt Tofte, 13.
They were young lives cut short, victims of the great western wildfires of 2020.
The arrival of fire season in the American West always brings fear of fatalities, especially among the elderly and infirm, unable to escape the flames. But the deaths of Josiah and Wyatt, two athletic teenagers, speak to the speed and the ferocity of the fires that this year have burned a record number of acres, four million in California and Oregon combined.
In Scio, Oregon, the logging and farming town in the Willamette Valley where Wyatt Tofte went to middle school, a teacher and school administrator went door to door to Wyatt’s classmates on Friday to check on them. The start of school, which will be held remotely, has been delayed by the fires.
In a community like Scio with a population of around 1,000 people and one blinking traffic signal, children grow up together and know one another well. “The realisation will hit the kids when they have to physically go back to school, and he’s not there anymore,” said Margot Cooper, whose daughter was Wyatt’s classmate.
Wyatt loved football and video games, was exceedingly polite and did a great imitation of the alien dog character, Stitch, from the Disney movie Lilo and Stitch, his friends said. He was surrounded by animals at home and was inseparable from Duke, his giant bull mastiff.
Berry Creek, on the edge of the Sierra Nevada, is a similarly tight-knit town. A community of about 1,200 people, it sits at the edge of the Plumas National Forest.
Josiah, nicknamed “Jojo” by family and friends, was described as a caring teenager who was quick to smile. Josiah, who loved living in the mountains — and was fond of riding horses and playing video games — was a “great lovable sweet” son, his mother Jessica Williams said.
The fires that claimed Josiah and Wyatt both flared suddenly and unexpectedly.
The Bear Fire, which had been burning northeast of Sacramento at a moderate pace for days, exploded. Propelled by winds as strong as 70km an hour, it burned 230,000 acres in the span of a night. Most Berry Creek residents evacuated the town in a panic, a narrow country road the only route to safety. Josiah was missing.
On social media, his mother, Jessica, pleaded for the public to help authorities find him. “Please everyone my son is missing and not to be found so please dear God help my family and find my son,” Jessica wrote on Facebook.
Josiah’s father and brother had left the area, but he seemed to have stayed behind and was last seen on Bean Creek Road near the town, his mother wrote. Josiah’s father had driven away from the home to check on family, and Josiah and his older brother had planned to leave the house in their separate cars.
Josiah’s father said that he soon realised that his sons hadn’t made the evacuation, so he tried to return to the house only to find the roads were blocked. Josiah’s brother, Jason, was soon found. But Josiah was not. On Thursday, the sheriff told the family that they had found Josiah’s remains. “I’m so sorry son I wasn’t there to protect you,” Josiah’s mother said in a Facebook post. “I love you so much and miss you.”
In the evergreen forests southeast of Salem, the situation was equally chaotic.
On Monday evening, Kevin Cameron, a Marion county commissioner, awoke to the sounds of sirens in his neighbourhood. The Beachie Creek Fire, which had been burning nearby since mid-August, swept down the canyon that runs along the Santiam river.
The Tofte family lived in a home in the canyon, three generations on the same property. According to a devastating account in The Salem Statesman Journal, Wyatt’s mother fled the fire on foot, her clothes burned off. She is now in a Portland hospital with severe burns.
Wyatt’s father led a desperate search for his son, a mission that would end with the discovery of Wyatt’s remains on the family property in the driver’s seat of a car.
The remains of his grandmother, Peggy Mosso, 71, were also found in the vehicle, as were those of Duke, according to the Marion county sheriff. Mosso had recently fallen and broken her leg; Wyatt, it appears, was trying to drive her to safety.
“All the moms we’ve been talking,” said Cooper. “All of these kids are our kids,” she said, her voice trembling. “It’s hard.”

Worst air quality on planet in West Coast," Exhausted fire crews worked on Sunday to beat back raging wildfires that have scorched millions of acres across three western US states, all while an anguished search goes on for the dozens of people who remain unaccounted.
At least 23 people have died in the fires, and in Oregon, which has taken the biggest blow in the last few days, officials have warned of the possibility of “mass fatality incidents”.
Thousands have been pushed from their homes as communities have been swallowed by flames. The fires have also cast a haze over a broad stretch of the West Coast, leaving the region with what officials have said is the worst air quality on the planet.
“It is apocalyptic,” senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said on Sunday on the ABC programme This Week. “I drove 600 miles up and down the state, and I never escaped the smoke. We have thousands of people who have lost their homes. I could have never envisioned this.”
The fires in Oregon have already consumed more than one million acres and forced tens of thousands of people out of their homes. That is in addition to the record-setting 3.1 million acres burned in California and over 600,000 acres burned in Washington State.
The National Weather Service said the air quality could begin to improve for some cities from Monday.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit McClellan Park, California, on Monday to be briefed on the wildfires. “I spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington,” he said late on Saturday. “They’ve never had anything like this.”",world

Afghan government and Taliban talks begin," Afghan government representatives and Taliban insurgents gathered on Saturday for historic peace talks aimed at ending two decades of war that has killed tens of thousands of combatants and civilians.
Ahead of face-to-face negotiations in coming days, the warring sides were urged by various countries and groups to reach an immediate ceasefire and forge an agreement that upholds women’s rights.
The government of US President Donald Trump, who is eager to claim an end to America’s longest conflict as he seeks re-election, expressed its intention to use aid as leverage for a deal.
The opening ceremony came one day after the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the US that triggered its military involvement in Afghanistan.
Secretary of state Mike Pompeo urged the warring sides to seize the opportunity to strike a comprehensive peace deal, while acknowledging many challenges lay ahead.
“The choice of your political system is yours to make,” he told the opening ceremony in the Qatari capital Doha. “We believe firmly that protecting the rights of all Afghans is the best way for you to break the cycle of violence.”
The head of Afghanistan’s peace council, Abdullah Abdullah, said that even if the two sides could not agree on all points, they should compromise.
“My delegation are in Doha representing a political system that is supported by millions of men and women from a diversity of cultural, social and ethnic backgrounds in our homeland,” he said.
Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund said that Afghanistan should “have an Islamic system in which all tribes and ethnicities of the country find themselves without any discrimination and live their lives in love and brotherhood”.
Pompeo warned that the size and scope of future US financial assistance, which relies heavily on global funding, would depend on their “choices and conduct”. US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said preventing terrorism was the chief condition.",world
Iran executes wrestler accused of murder," Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari was executed on Saturday after being convicted of stabbing a security guard to death during anti-government protests in 2018, state media said, in a case that has sparked international outcry.
Afkari was executed “this morning after legal procedures were carried out at the insistence of the parents and the family of the victim”, the media quoted the head of the justice department in southern Fars province, Kazem Mousavi, as saying.
Afkari was convicted of killing Hassan Turkman, a water company security guard, and other charges. Iran's Supreme Court rejected a review of the case in late August.
Afkari, a 27-year-old Greco-Roman wrestler, had said he was tortured into making a false confession, according to his family and activists, and his attorney says there is no proof of his guilt. Iran’s judiciary has denied Afkari’s claims.
Afkari’s attorney accused authorities of denying his client a family visit before the execution, as required by law.

“Were you in so much hurry to execute the sentence that you also deprived Navid of a last meeting?,” Hassan Younesi said on Twitter.
There was no immediate reaction by Iranian officials to the attorney’s accusation.
The International Olympic Committee said the execution of Afkari was “very sad news”, adding in a statement that IOC president Thomas Bach had written this week to Iranian leaders asking for mercy for him, while respecting Iran’s sovereignty.
A global union representing 85,000 athletes had called on Tuesday for Iran’s expulsion from world sport if it executed Afkari.
Afkari’s case had sparked an outcry from Iranians on social media and human rights groups. US President Donald Trump also called on Iran this month not to execute the wrestler.
The killing of the security guard took place during some of the worst unrest in a decade over economic hardships. Iran’s clerical rulers have blamed the street protests what they call “thugs” linked to exiles and foreign foes — the US and Israel.
Iranian state TV aired a video last week in which Afkari appeared to confess to Turkman’s killing.
It also showed what appeared to be written confessions by Afkari.",world
17 killed in Oregon wildfires," A 36-mile-wide line of flames edged into the towns around Portland, Oregon, and cities along the West Coast were smothered in acrid smoke and ash on Friday as history-making wildfires remained unchecked, killing at least 17 and leaving dozens of people missing.
“We are preparing for a mass fatality incident based on what we know and the numbers of structures that have been lost,” Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, said as firefighters struggled to contain blazes that have spread across millions of acres of the Pacific Northwest.
Fires in California, Oregon and Washington have torn through idyllic mountain towns, reduced neighbourhoods to ash and spewed so much smoke that pilots were unable to pursue aerial attacks that can be critical in preventing such mass wildfires from encroaching on communities. 
Portland’s mayor, fearing the possibility that fires could start and spread in the city, has declared a state of emergency.
Combined, the states have seen nearly five million acres consumed by fire — a land mass nearly the size of New Jersey — in a record-setting made worse, scientists say, by the climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

Such disasters will only become worse as the planet continues to warm. The flames also left a humanitarian disaster in their wake, including three more deaths in Oregon that were confirmed on Friday. 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of homes have been lost, most of them in Oregon, where an estimated 40,000 people have been evacuated and as many as 500,000 live in evacuation alert zones, poised to flee with a change in the winds. 
Tens of thousands of people have sought refuge in shelters, with friends and in parking lots up and down Interstate 5 — with emergency responders struggling to create safe shelter for all of them. On the outskirts of Portland, a site set up to shelter evacuees had to be evacuated itself as the fire line continued expanding towards suburban towns.",world
Astra resumes Oxford vaccine clinical trials," AstraZeneca has resumed British clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development, after getting the green light from safety watchdogs, the company said on Saturday.
The late-stage trials of the experimental vaccine, developed with researchers from the University of Oxford, were suspended this week after an illness in a volunteer in Britain, casting doubts on an early rollout.
“On 6 September, the standard review process triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials to allow review of safety data by independent committees, and international regulators,” AstraZeneca said.
It added that safety reviewers had recommended to Britain’s Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) that it was safe to resume the British trials.
The patient involved in the study had been reportedly suffering from neurological symptoms associated with a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.

AstraZeneca, based in Cambridge, said it could not disclose further medical information.
“The Company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic,” AstraZeneca said.
It declined to elaborate further on when other global trials were expected to restart.
The Serum Institute of India said it would restart its trials once it had permission from the Drugs Controller General of India.
Brazil’s health regulator ANVISA said it was awaiting notice from the British MHRA confirming that resumption of trials has been authorised before resuming in Brazil.
The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is conducting the paused trials, said in a statement that 4,600 of the planned 5,000 volunteers have been recruited and vaccinated without any of them reporting any serious health issues.
Governments around the world are desperate for a vaccine to help end the pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil. The WHO had flagged AstraZeneca’s as the most promising.  
The vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials in the US, Britain, Brazil and South Africa and additional trials are planned in Japan and Russia. 
The pause of the trials came after reports that the US was aiming for fast-track authorisation or approval of a vaccine before November’s presidential election.
Leading US and European vaccine developers have pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines and not bow to political pressures to rush the process.
AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply close to three billion doses to governments across the globe.
The WHO’s chief scientist said the pause in the trials should serve as a “wake-up” call that there would be ups and downs in the development of a vaccine. “Inevitably with such a large trial there will be times when safety issues arise,” said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.",world
Sheikh Hasina against extrajudicial killings," Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said that her government is against extrajudicial killings and has tried to stop the continuation of such crimes initiated by military dictator Zia-ur Rahman and institutionalised by his wife and former premier Khaleda Zia, according to a media report. 
Hasina said this during her valedictory speech in parliament on Thursday when deputy leader of the Opposition G.M. Quader drew her attention to the issue of extrajudicial killings, the Dhaka Tribune reported. 
“You are telling about the extrajudicial killings. But who had initiated it? It started during the tenure of Zia-ur Rahman as bodies of our many leaders and activists were not found at that time. And afterwards, it (extrajudicial killing) got institutional shape (during the tenure of Khaleda Zia). We tried to stop its continuation,” she said. 
“We are not sparing anyone (involved in extrajudicial killings) and we never do that,” she said, adding that her government has been taking appropriate measures against the wrongdoers. 
On Wednesday, a Dhaka court sentenced three policemen to life imprisonment in a case lodged over the custodial death of a youth in Dhaka’s Mirpur area in 2014, the report said.
The Prime Minister also appreciated the country’s law enforcement agencies for their work.
“At the same time, we have to think that the law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly to control the narcotics, terrorism and militancy by risking their lives and they have achieved huge success to this end,” she said.",world
Pakistan anger over twin rapes," A 5-year-old girl in southern Pakistan was raped, hit on the head and set on fire. Five days later, a woman in the country’s east was dragged from her car and sexually assaulted on a highway in front of her children.
The two episodes, which occurred hundreds of miles apart, have prompted protests and an outpouring of rage in a country that critics say has a toxic culture surrounding sexual assaults and child abuse.
Hashtags calling for justice for the victims have been shared widely on social media by ordinary people, Opposition politicians and high-profile athletes, including Shan Masood, a member of Pakistan’s national cricket team.
“We cannot lose our youth to such disgusting and inhuman acts,” Masood wrote on Twitter. “Keeping quiet is contributing to the issue. We must stand up to these cowards and take action.”
Pakistan has been plagued by episodes of rape and child abuse over the years. Victims are often treated as criminals or blamed for the assaults. Human rights activists have long said that officials at all levels of the national government have regularly failed to address the issue in a comprehensive way.

“There is a lot of indifference” to such cases from Pakistani officials, said Mehnaz Akber Aziz, a member of the Opposition in the National Assembly and a prominent children’s rights advocate. “There is no empathy, only silence. That is changing, because the public is pushing back.”
Aziz said that most of the child rape and abuse victims come from small towns, and their cases do not usually catch fire on social media. Officials generally do not visit them either, she said, and perpetrators are often quietly released after public outrage has subsided — lending a sense of impunity after the crimes.

Bahrain becomes latest Arab nation to recognise Israel," Bahrain has become the latest Arab nation to agree to normalise ties with Israel as part of a broader diplomatic push by President Donald Trump and his administration to fully integrate the Jewish state into West Asia. 
Trump announced the agreement on Friday, following a three-way phone call he had with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The three leaders also issued a brief six-paragraph joint statement, attesting to the deal. 
“Another HISTORIC breakthrough today!” Trump tweeted.
The announcement on the 19th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks came less than a week before Trump hosts a White House ceremony to mark the establishment of full relations between Israel and the UAE. Bahrain’s foreign minister will attend the event. 
It represents another diplomatic win for Trump less than two months before the the presidential election and an opportunity to shore up support among pro-Israel evangelical Christians. Just last week, Trump announced agreements in principle for Kosovo to recognise Israel and for Serbia to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

“This is a historic breakthrough to further peace in the Middle East,” Trump, Netanyahu and King Hamad said in the statement. 
“Opening direct dialogue and ties between these two dynamic societies and advanced economies will continue the positive transformation of the Middle East and increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region.” 
Like the UAE agreement, Friday’s Bahrain-Israel deal will normalise diplomatic, commercial, security and other relations between the two countries. 
Bahrain, along with Saudi Arabia, had already dropped a prohibition on Israeli flights using its airspace. Saudi acquiescence to the agreements has been considered key to the deals. 
Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner noted that the agreement is the second Israel has reached with an Arab country in 30 days after having made peace with only two Arab nations — Egypt and Jordan — in 72 years of its independence. 
“This is very fast,” Kushner said. “The region is responding very favourably to the UAE deal and hopefully it’s a sign that even more will come.” The pact will likely be seen as a further setback to the Palestinians who tried unsuccessfully to have the Arab League condemn normalisation with Israel until they have secured an independent state. 
The statement made passing mention of the Palestinians, saying the parties will continue efforts “to achieve a just, comprehensive, and enduring resolution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict to enable the Palestinian people to realise their full potential.” ",world
Biden supporters release remix of 'Lagaan' song to woo Indian-Americans," Democratic Party members have released a musical video remix of popular ""Chale Chalo"" song from the superhit Bollywood movie, 'Lagaan', to woo Indian-American voters ahead of the US presidential election.
In the November 3 election, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his Indian-American running mate Kamala Harris will challenge incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
""Chale Chalo, Chale Chalo, Biden ko Vote do, Biden ki Jeet Ho, Unki Haar Haan,"" says the lyrics of the song sung by Silicon Valley-based Bollywood Singer Titli Banerjee and released by entrepreneur couple Ajay and Vinita Bhutoria.
""It is a warfighting song, drawing from the energy of Indian celebrations, inspiring our community to awaken and vote for Biden-Harris in November,"" Bhutoria said after the video was released on various social media platforms on Thursday.
This is the second national Indian-American outreach video that the couple has produced to unite all South-Asians and people of Indian-origin to support Biden and Harris. Born to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Harris is the first Indian-American and first Black woman to be picked by a major American political party for the top post.
""South Asians for Biden is thrilled to serve as a partner on this important video, which encourages Indian-Americans to vote for Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris,"" said Neha Dewan, National Director of South Asians for Biden.
""The stakes of this upcoming presidential election could not be higher for the Indian American community, which is why our diverse community is united behind the Biden-Harris ticket. It is absolutely crucial that we make a show of force of our voting strength. The South Asian community can be the crucial margin of victory this November,"" she said.
Titli Banerjee said getting the right message across during elections through music has been a long held tradition in India.
I am glad that I was able to contribute through my voice in recreating that experience and hope that the message to go out and vote for the future of America reaches all Indian Americans,"" she said.
Referring to the video, Bhutoria, who is also on the National AAPI Leadership Council and the National Finance committee for Biden for President 2020, said it presents the diversity of people in American community inspired by Biden's vision of hope and change.
""We come from all ages, places and professions, but we are united in our passion for a candidate who represents our common values, he said.
There is an estimated four million Indian-American population of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the November 2020 presidential election.
There are over six million South Asian voters and 1.3 million Indian-American voters in key battleground states, including Texas, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania.
Bhutoria claimed that over 80 per cent of the South Asians are supporting the Biden-Harris ticket.
We believe that we (South Asians) can help power Vice President Biden and Senator Harris to victory, he asserted.
The video outreach is supported by South Asians for Biden, Impact Fund, They SeeBlue, Indians for Biden National leadership council and several other South Asian organisations. It will also be shared by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for the Biden team, according to a media statement.
The video was created by Ritesh of Awesome TV.

Pakistan Sikhs want rare scripture in gurdwara," Pakistan’s minority Sikh community want a rare, handwritten copy of the Guru Granth Sahib, estimated to be 300 years old and currently on display at a Lahore museum, to be placed at the Gurdwara Dera Sahib, a media report said on Thursday. 
The handwritten copy of the holy book, along with other artifacts, were received by the museum as a donation from various individuals and organisations, according to a museum official. 
“While there is no date on it, the writing and ink shows it is more than three hundred years old,” Aliza Saba Rizvi, a researcher and in charge of the section of Lahore’s museum dedicated to Sikhism, was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune. 
“This is a rare copy of the Guru Granth Sahib,” Rizvi said, adding that a similar copy of the holy scripture is also found at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. 
The Sikhs want the scripture to be placed inside the Gurdwara Dera Sahib, a temple situated in the heart of Lahore which stands at the spot where the fifth guru of Sikhism, Guru Arjan Dev, was martyred in 1606, the report said.

“This ancient copy of Guru Granth Sahib must be kept in a Gurdwara Sahib,” said a senior member of the community.
“It cannot be kept in a closet like any ordinary book. It needs to be placed inside the Gurdwara with the respect it deserves,” said Sardar Bishan Singh, the former head of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (PSGPC).
The community leader said he would place the demand on the agenda during the next meeting of the PSGPC. 
Singh suggested the museum should transfer the rare scripture to the gurdwara or hire a member of the community to take care of the holy book as prescribed by Sikh customs. ",world
Nelson Mandela’s lawyer George Bizos dead," Anti-apartheid crusader and Nelson Mandela’s personal lawyer George Bizos has died at 92, his family said Wednesday.
He died of natural causes at home, the family said. 
Bizos, who came to South Africa as a 13-year-old fleeing the Nazi occupation of Greece, played a key role in the legal fight to end apartheid, the racist system used to oppress South Africa’s Black majority for decades. 
Bizos represented Mandela from his treason trial in 1964 until the former South African President’s death in 2013. The lawyer is credited with getting Mandela to add the words “if needs be” to his speech from the dock in which he said he was prepared to die for his ideals. 
The addition was seen as an escape clause, avoiding any impression that Mandela was goading the court to impose the death penalty.
Bizos represented a wide range of people who defied apartheid’s harsh laws, including the families of slain anti-apartheid activists such as Steve Biko, and helped write the laws for the newly democratic country after the end of apartheid in 1994. 
Bizos remained active in human rights work in South Africa well into his 80s, working for the Legal Resources Center, a South African human rights group. AP ",world
Spacecraft named after Kalpana Chawla," An American commercial cargo spacecraft bound for the International Space Station has been named after Nasa astronaut Kalpana Chawla, the first India-born woman to enter space, for her key contributions to human spaceflight. 
Northrop Grumman, an American global aerospace and defence technology company, announced that its next Cygnus capsule will be named the “SS Kalpana Chawla”, in memory of the mission specialist who died with her six crewmates aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 2003. 
“Today we honour Kalpana Chawla, who made history at Nasa as the first female astronaut of Indian descent. Her contributions to human spaceflight have had a lasting impact,” the company tweeted on Wednesday. 
“Northrop Grumman is proud to name the NG-14 Cygnus spacecraft after former astronaut Kalpana Chawla. It is the company’s tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who has played a pivotal role in human spaceflight,” the company said on its website. 
“Chawla was selected in honour of her prominent place in history as the first woman of Indian descent to go to space,” it said.

Large fire erupts in jittery Beirut," A large fire erupted at Beirut port on Thursday, engulfing parts of the Lebanese capital in a pall of smoke weeks after a massive blast devastated the port and surrounding residential area.
The blaze began in the shattered duty free zone of the port, prompting some residents to flee the city still traumatised by last month’s explosion which followed a port fire.
 Army helicopters dropped water as firefighters battled on the ground to bring the blaze under control. By evening, officials said most flames had been extinguished. Smoke still rose from smouldering wreckage but it was far less dense.
“For sure we were scared, it's only been a month since the explosion that destroyed Beirut. We saw the same thing happening again,” 53-year-old Andre Muarbes said as soot and ash fell on vehicles and buildings across parts of the capital.
Officials said no one had been injured, but the blaze strained nerves already on edge in a nation grappling with a deep economic crisis that has posed the biggest threat to Lebanon’s stability since its 1975-1990 civil war.

Michel Najjar, public works minister in the outgoing government which resigned in the wake of the blast, told Lebanon’s MTV initial indications suggested the blaze was sparked by welding work during repairs at the port.
A military source said it appeared to have started when cooking oil caught fire and spread to stores of tyres. At one point, live television footage had shown flames licking up near a pile of tires in a warehouse ruined by last month’s explosion. The August 4 blast killed about 190 people and injured 6,000.
Majed Hassanein, 49, was taking his wife and two children out of the capital by car during the height of the blaze.
“I am forced to get them out of Beirut from the smoke and the fire that is happening at the port again,” he said.  His son, he said, was still suffering shock from the blast. ",world
Woodward defends delay in disclosure," Bob Woodward, facing widespread criticism for only now revealing President Donald Trump’s early concerns about the severity of the coronavirus, has told The Associated Press that he needed time to be sure that Trump’s private comments from February were accurate.
In Woodward’s upcoming book on Trump, Rage, the President is quoted saying the virus was highly contagious and “deadly stuff” at a time he was publicly dismissing it as no worse than the flu.
Woodward, the celebrated Washington Post journalist and best-selling author, spoke with Trump more than a dozen times for his book. 
“He tells me this, and I’m thinking, ‘Wow, that’s interesting, but is it true?’ Trump says things that don’t check out, right?” Woodward told the AP during a telephone interview on Wednesday. 
Using a famous phrase from the Watergate era, when Woodward’s reporting for the Post helped lead to President Richard Nixon’s resignation, Woodward said his mission was to determine, “What did he know and when did he know it?”

On Twitter and elsewhere online, commentators accused Woodward of valuing book sales over public health. 
“Nearly 200,000 Americans have died because neither Donald Trump nor Bob Woodward wanted to risk anything substantial to keep the country informed,” wrote Esquire’s Charles P Pierce. 
The issue of daily journalists presenting newsworthy information in books isn’t new. The competition for attention is intense, and headlines help boost sales and guest shots for interviews. 
Reporter Michael S. Schmidt of The New York Times recently attracted attention for his book, Donald Trump v. The United States, by reporting new details on an unannounced visit by Trump to Walter Reed military hospital in November 2019. 
Schmidt reported that Vice-President Mike Pence was put on alert that he might have to briefly assume the powers of the presidency if the president had to undergo a procedure that required anaesthesia.
Pence later said he didn’t recall being put on standby for the Reed visit, which the White House has said was part of the president's routine annual physical. But Schmidt’s book renewed speculation about Trump’s health. 
Political figures with book deals also have been chastised for holding back timely material. 
Former national security adviser John Bolton, whose scathing memoir The Room Where It Happened came out in June, declined discussing Trump’s actions towards Ukraine while the impeachment hearings were being held earlier this year. 
Woodward’s book, which comes out next week, draws from 18 conversations with Trump between December and July. 
During his AP interview, Woodward said Trump called him “out of the blue” in early February to “unburden himself” about the virus, which then had few cases in the US. 
But Woodward said that only in May was he was satisfied that Trump’s comments were based on reliable information and that by then the virus had spread nationwide. 
“If I had done the story at that time about what he knew in February, that’s not telling us anything we didn’t know,” Woodward said. At that point, he said, the issue was no longer one of public health.",world
American spacecraft named after Kalpana Chawla," An American commercial cargo spacecraft bound for the International Space Station has been named after fallen NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, the first India-born woman to enter space, for her key contributions to human spaceflight.

""Her final research conducted onboard Columbia helped us understand astronaut health and safety during spaceflight. Northrop Grumman is proud to celebrate the life of Kalpana Chawla and her dream of flying through the air and in space,"" it said.
The S S Kalpana Chawla capsule is scheduled to launch on the NG-14 mission atop a Northrop Grumman Antares rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on September 29. The spacecraft will arrive at and be attached to the space station two days later.
For the NG-14 mission, the Cygnus spacecraft will deliver approximately 3,629 kg of cargo to the space station.
Chawla began her career at NASA in 1988 as a powered-lift computational fluid dynamics researcher at the Ames Research Center in California.
Her work concentrated on the simulation of complex air flows encountered by aircraft flying in ground-effect.
In 1993, Chawla joined Overset Methods Inc. as vice president and a researcher in aerodynamics.
After becoming a naturalised US citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA astronauts corps. She was selected in December 1994 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in Houston in 1995 as an astronaut candidate in Group 15.
In November 1996, Chawla was assigned as a mission specialist on STS-87 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to fly in space.
Chawla's second spaceflight experience came in 2001 when she was selected for the crew of STS-107. The flight was dedicated to science and research, with approximately 80 experiments completed.
Chawla lost her life during the STS-107 mission when the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon reentering the Earth's atmosphere.",world
US blocks visas for some China students," The US is blocking visas for certain Chinese graduate students and researchers to prevent them from stealing sensitive research, the acting head of the US department of homeland security, said on Wednesday.
Chad Wolf repeated US charges of unjust business practices and industrial espionage by China, including attempts to steal coronavirus research, and accused it of abusing student visas to exploit American academia.
“We are blocking visas for certain Chinese graduate students and researchers with ties to China’s military fusion strategy to prevent them from stealing and otherwise appropriating sensitive research,” he said in a speech in Washington.
Wolf said the US was also “preventing goods produced from slave labour from entering our markets, demanding that China respect the inherent dignity of each human being,” an apparent reference to alleged abuses of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region.
Wolf did not give details.
US Customs and Border Protection officials have prepared orders to block imports of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over accusations of forced labour, though a formal announcement has been delayed.
Sino-US relations have sunk to historic lows with the world's two biggest economies clashing over issues ranging from trade and human rights to Hong Kong and the coronavirus.

"12,000 with no shelter after migrant camp fire on Lesbos"," Thousands of migrants were left without shelter on Wednesday after overnight fires gutted their overcrowded camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, and authorities warned that some asylum seekers who tested positive for Covid-19 could spread the virus.
The Moria camp, which hosts more than 12,000 people, was “probably totally destroyed”, one Greek migration official said. Athens declared a state of emergency on Lesbos.
As migrants camped out in fields nearby or sifted through smouldering debris in search of possessions, deputy migration minister George Koumoutsakos said about 3,000 people affected by the fires would be  housed in tents.
“The situation in Moria cannot go on (as it is) because it is simultaneously a public health and national security issue,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address, adding that managing migrant flows was a “European problem”.
The cause of the fires, which broke out soon after midnight, remained unclear but authorities were investigating whether they were started deliberately after Covid-19 tests led to the isolation of a number of refugees.

Trump tells journalist he ‘downplayed virus’," President Trump acknowledged to the journalist Bob Woodward that he had knowingly played down the coronavirus earlier this year even though he was aware it was “deadly” and vastly more serious than the seasonal flu.
“This is deadly stuff,” Mr. Trump told Woodward on February 7 in one of a series of interviews he conducted with the President for his upcoming book, Rage. The Washington Post and CNN were given advance copies of the book and published details on Wednesday.
“You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” Trump said. “And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.”
That was a vastly different story than Trump was telling the public.
“I wanted to always play it down,” Trump told Woodward on March 19. “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”
In public, Trump claimed early on that the virus would disappear, predicting in February that by April, “when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away”. Woodward conducted 18 interviews with Trump for the book, due to be released Sept 15.
The White House on Wednesday denied Trump intentionally misled Americans about the virus, which has killed more than 190,000 people in the US so far, with new cases spiking in the Midwest.
“Absolutely not,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news briefing shortly after reports about the book emerged. “The President never downplayed the virus.”  Dr Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious diseases expert, expressed concern on Wednesday morning about the example President Trump had set the night before when he held a large campaign rally in North Carolina without wearing a mask.
Appearing on CBS This Morning to talk about the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine, Dr Fauci was asked whether the sight of such rallies was frustrating for him.
“Well, yes it is, and I’ve said that often,” he said. “We want to set an example.”
Some North Carolina Republicans had apparently hoped that the President would wear a mask as well.
Before the rally, Dave Plyler, the Republican chairman of the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners, was quoted by The Winston-Salem Journal as saying that he believed Trump should wear a mask.
“It’s been ordered by the governor,” Plyler said, noting the state’s virus orders. “When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in North Carolina, do as the governor says.”
But Trump, who has worn masks in public only a handful of times, and who mocked his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr, for wearing one just last week, appeared at the rally without a mask. 
Scott Sexton, a columnist at The Journal, wrote after the rally that “red hats outnumbered masks and face coverings by at least a 100-to-1”.
Dr Fauci said that public health measures such as wearing masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds and moving activities outdoors rather than indoors “are the kind of things that turn around surges and also prevent us from getting surges”.

"Blamed for virus deaths, Trump calls Biden stupid"," Republican President Donald Trump, accused by Joe Biden of putting lives at risk in his handling of the coronavirus, on Monday called his Democratic rival “stupid” and demanded an apology for what Trump called anti-vaccine rhetoric.
Trailing in national opinion polls as the US death toll from the virus approaches 190,000, Trump unleashed a broad attack against both the former vice president, his opponent in the November 3 election, and Biden’s running mate, US Senator Kamala Harris. Trump has said that a vaccine against the virus would be ready in record time, perhaps before the election.
Harris had said she would not trust Trump with a vaccine before the election and Biden, critical of Trump’s response to the virus, has urged Americans to heed the scientists. Critics accuse Trump of undermining scientists during the pandemic.
 Speaking in front of the White House at a US Labour Day news conference, Trump said: “Biden and his very liberal running mate, the most liberal person in Congress by the way — is not a competent person in my opinion, would destroy this country and would destroy this economy — should immediately apologise for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now,” adding: “It undermines science.”

Drug firms in Covid vaccine vow," Nine drug companies issued a joint pledge on Tuesday that they would “stand with science” and not put forward a vaccine until it had been thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.
The companies did not rule out seeking an emergency authorisation of their vaccines, but promised that any potential coronavirus vaccine would be decided based on “large, high quality clinical trials” and that the companies would follow guidance from regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.
“We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,” they said.
President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a vaccine could be available before Election Day, November 3, heightening fears that his administration is politicising the race by scientists to develop a vaccine and potentially undermining public trust in any vaccine approved.
“We’ll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date,” the President said on Monday. “You know what date I’m talking about.”

Three of the companies that signed the pledge are testing their candidate vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the US: Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. But only Pfizer has said that it could apply to the FDA for emergency approval as early as October.
In the nine companies’ statement on Tuesday, they did not mention  Trump, saying only that they have “a united commitment to uphold the integrity of the scientific process”.",world
Pakistan court sentences Christian man to death," A Pakistani court on Tuesday sentenced a Christian man to death on blasphemy charges.
 Asif Pervaiz, a garment factory worker, had been accused by his supervisor of sending derogatory remarks about a holy man to him in a text message. Insults of this nature carry a mandatory death penalty in Pakistan.
Pervais was convicted after a trial in Lahore that ran since 2013. His lawyer Saif-ul-Malook told Reuters he would appeal the sentence.
 The court order, seen by Reuters, said Pervaiz would first serve a three-year prison term for “misusing” his phone to send the derogatory text message. Then “he shall be hanged by his neck till his death”. He was also fined 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($300), the order said.
Pervaiz told the court his supervisor made the accusation only after he had refused to convert to Islam, Saif-ul-Malook said. The complainant’s lawyer, Murtaza Chaudhry, denied this was the case.

Sheikh Hasina for ‘martial law’ purge," Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose country and family have suffered incalculable loss from coups, on Monday issued a call to discard the term “martial law” from the military lexicon.
“We should exclude ‘martial law’ from the military lexicon as it has never helped the country or the armed forces, only resulting in bloodbaths,” the Prime Minister told an audience that included top generals as she addressed a virtual meeting of the Armed Forces Selection Board.
“A number of officers and soldiers were killed during these coups. The death toll in these coups was higher than the number of deaths from real wars. We don’t want to hear the cries of a father or a mother after losing their sons in coups,” Hasina said in an impassioned speech.
She was referring to the 19 coup attempts that took place during the military rule of Ziaur Rahman, who had taken charge of the country using provisions of martial law in 1977.
Bangladesh has been vulnerable to martial law since its independence in 1971, witnessing numerous coup attempts, some of them successful.

Undoubtedly, Hasina’s family has been the biggest victim of the army’s interest in running the government through martial law, which suspends regular laws.
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s first democratically elected leader of the government after independence and Hasina’s father, was killed along with 18 family members on August 15, 1975, in a coup. Five days later, the country was placed under retrospective martial law.
Hasina and her sister Rehana survived the attack as they were out of the country. But the martial law prevented her from returning to Bangladesh till 1981.
On Monday, Hasina sent out a message that martial law had no place in today’s democratic Bangladesh.
Major General (retired) Abdur Rashid later said: “A lot of people, including some in political circles, consider martial law a means of power transfer because of some past instances…. The Prime Minister made it clear today that it’s no longer possible.”
Hasina had chosen the occasion with care. She was addressing the senior-most officers, including chief of army staff General Aziz Ahmed, in the country’s defence establishment. The meeting with the generals, a bi-annual ritual, was held to clear promotions in the highest echelons of the armed forces.
The history of Bangladesh is replete with examples of officers and soldiers being killed in coups.
Ziaur Rahman was himself assassinated by a faction of officers in the port city of Chittagong on May 30, 1981. In less than a year, the country witnessed another coup when the army chief, General H.M. Ershad, assumed power by replacing an elected government. The dictator ran the country till 1990, suspending the parliament and the constitution.
“Our country has suffered so much because of martial law, which is unconstitutional,” said Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, decorated war hero and former foreign secretary, supporting the Prime Minister’s views.
Some Bangladeshi politicians from the ruling Awami League and the Opposition that this correspondent spoke to said that despite the suffering inflicted by martial law, the possibility of the army stepping in to run the nation has always fascinated a segment of the population.
“There’s no denying that martial law has had a populist appeal in our country,” a senior politician said.
Rashid, himself an army veteran, agreed but was quick to add that such popularity had always been short-lived.
“We had an army-backed caretaker government in 2007 but its popularity was short-lived because of its excesses,” he said.
Hasina, whose family was almost wiped out in the coup of 1975, has been the beneficiary of the ordinary Bangladeshi’s refusal to be ruled by an army-backed, puppet civilian government.
Not only did Hasina win with a convincing majority in 2008, she has since then ridden to power in two successive elections. Many in the Opposition have accused her of using the armed forces to win the two elections but there is little doubt that Hasina has, at least till now, kept the men in uniform confined to the barracks.
The Prime Minister’s message on Monday suggested she had managed to establish political control over the military. “She made it clear that only the law enshrined in the Constitution will prevail in Bangladesh, and that’s a strong message,” Chowdhury said.",world
US scribes’ credentials not renewed by China," China has refrained from renewing the expiring press credentials for journalists from US media outlets, two of the affected news organisations reported, amid an ongoing tussle with the United States over journalist visas.
The move comes as Chinese journalists in the US wait for their lapsed work visas to be renewed. The Chinese journalists have been allowed to stay in the US during a 90-day grace period that expires in early November, according
to people familiar with the matter.
The Wall Street Journal’s Jeremy Page, a Briton, and American journalist David Culver from CNN were issued letters allowing them to continue working in China with their expired press credentials, the two outlets reported respectively.
Culver was told the arrangement had nothing to do with his reporting but was a “reciprocal measure” in response to the Trump administration’s treatment of Chinese journalists, CNN reported.

The WSJ reported that authorities had indicated that renewal of the press passes would depend on what happened with Chinese journalists in the US.
 Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday on Twitter that “we would be glad to continue our excellent cooperation with the US journalists here if Chinese journalists are treated fairly in the US.”
“#CNN journalist and a few other US journalists’ visa extension applications are being processed, during which they can continue to live and work here with no problems at all”, she added.
Visas allowing foreign journalists to live in China are linked to their press credentials. ",world
200 rescued from California wildfire," It should have been an idyllic Labour Day weekend, the serenity of the High Sierra region of California providing a welcome respite from protests and a pandemic.
But about 200 people — many of them unaware that a rapidly growing wildfire was closing in on a popular campground area in the Sierra National Forest — found themselves suddenly trapped while trying to flee on Saturday night into Sunday morning.
The very forest where they had come for a holiday escape now provided kindling that helped create a firestorm, one that prompted governor Gavin Newsom of California to declare a state of emergency.
It took a treacherous rescue operation by military helicopters to evacuate them from the Mammoth Pool Reservoir area, the authorities said. Others posted videos on social media showing themselves escaping by driving through a labyrinth of fire and ash.
“We had to splash water on our hair because our hair was catching on fire,” Rylee Zukovsky said on Sunday. “I was shovelling so much water into my face that I was almost drowning myself.”

 Zukovsky, 16, said she was rescued in a Chinook helicopter after taking refuge at the reservoir with her boyfriend, her mother and her mother’s boyfriend.
Her mother lives near the campground, which she helps run along with a nearby store. The store’s owner frantically tried to rescue her three dogs, said Zukovsky, who recalled diving into the reservoir when embers started to hit her.
There was little to no cellphone service, she said, explaining that it had taken 12 hours before she was rescued.
“Nobody knew helicopters were coming,” she said. “The Chinook just flew out of the smoke.”
Dozens of evacuees were packed into the helicopters. Two UH-60 Black Hawks and a CH-47 Chinook transported them to Fresno Yosemite International Airport, said Brad Alexander, a spokesman for the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.
About 20 people were injured, he said, and some were taken to hospitals.
Two people remained in very serious condition from burns, Daniel Lynch, the director of emergency medical services for Fresno cCounty, said on Sunday.
One of the burn patients, he said, was a 14-year-old girl being treated at the Valley Children’s Hospital in Madera, California. The others hurt were adults, who had injuries that included broken bones, lacerations and abrasions, he said.

Tenet grosses $20 million," Warner Bros. said on Sunday that Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated Tenet collected an estimated $20.2 million in wide release at North American theatres over the weekend and in previews.
It was Hollywood’s best domestic result since mid-March, when the coronavirus pandemic forced cinemas to close.
With the coronavirus still spreading widely in the US — Friday and Saturday brought 93,908 new reported infections — the arrival of Tenet was seen as a crucial test for Hollywood. Big turnout? All systems go for movies scheduled for release this autumn, including Wonder Woman 1984 and the latest James Bond extravaganza, No Time to Die. Sparse? Perhaps better to push big-budget movies into next year (and pray for a vaccine) or reroute them to streaming services, as Disney did withMulan, which was made available to Disney+ subscribers on Friday for $30.
The outcome was not quite definitive.
David A. Gross, who runs Franchise Entertainment Research, a film consultancy, assessed the domestic turnout for Tenet as “fair”.
“Audience concern with theater safety remains a deterrent,” he said in an email. “Tenet is a strong release, and Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. deserve enormous credit for their effort. For now, this is as good as it gets.”
He estimated that Tenet would have collected about $50 million over its first three days under normal circumstances. Tenet cost roughly $200 million to make, not including marketing costs. Ticket sales are typically split 50-50 between studios and cinemas, but Warner Bros. was able to negotiate a 65 per cent share, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In a statement, Toby Emmerich, the chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, credited Nolan with the film’s “box office success” and thanked movie theatre owners for being “unwavering in their commitment to a safe theatrical experience”.
The studio noted that Tenet has been received enthusiastically overseas, where ticket sales total $129 million after two weeks and public health conditions are mostly better than in the US. Tenet collected $30 million in China over its first three days, a record for a film directed by Nolan.

Kamala rebukes Trump on systemic racism," The US has two systems of justice for black and white Americans, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris said, as the Indian-origin senator rebuked President Donald Trump and his attorney-general for denying there is systemic racism in the country's justice system.
The strong criticism from Harris, the first black and Indian-American woman on a major party’s vice-presidential ticket, came less than two months before the US presidential election.
Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Harris are challenging incumbent Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence of the Republican Party in the November 3 election.
Harris, 55, strongly criticised Trump and attorney-general William Barr for denying there is systemic racism in the US justice system, saying they are “spending full time in a different reality”.
“The reality of America today is what we have seen over generations and, frankly, since our inception, which is, we do have two systems of justice in America,” Harris told CNN in an interview.

But she said she was optimistic that as a nation, Americans hold dear to an ideal that is inscribed in marble on the Supreme Court, which is that ideal of equal justice under law.
“And so, while we have two systems of justice, we also fight for equal justice under law. And that means doing what Joe Biden and I are proposing, which is having a criminal justice system that, yes, bans choke holds and carotid holds, makes sure that we’re going to require accountability for police officers who break the rules and break the law.”
Harris said their administration would invest in communities and the economic strength of those communities, but doing it all recognising that there are huge disparities in the country based on race.
“And it does us no good if we want to solve those disparities to pretend they don’t exist,” she said.
Harris also suggested that Trump was not a “real leader” on racial justice and was trying to “pretend that he has been a leader” on the coronavirus pandemic.
“I don’t think that most reasonable people who are paying attention to the facts would dispute that there are racial disparities and a system that has engaged in racism in terms of how the laws have been enforced,” said Harris, a California senator and former state attorney-general.
“It does us no good to deny that. Let’s just deal with it. Let’s be honest. These might be difficult conversations for some, but they’re not difficult conversations for leaders, not for real leaders.”
Barr, America’s top law enforcement official, dismissed the idea of “two justice systems” told CNN on Wednesday. “I think we have to be a little careful about throwing the idea of racism around,” he said. “I don’t think it is as common as people suggest.”
Asked specifically about systemic racism during his visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, last week, Trump refused to acknowledge it, saying, “Well, you know, you just keep getting back to the opposite subject. We should talk about the kind of violence we’ve seen in Portland and here and other places.”
Protests against racial injustice, particularly in law enforcement, have swept across America as police violence against Black Americans — including George Floyd in Minneapolis, Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin and Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York — has dominated headlines in recent months.
“I’m very clear that we have got to in America re-imagine how we are accomplishing public safety,” Harris — the child of immigrants from India and Jamaica — said.
“If we want to create safe communities, one of the smartest ways we can do that is invest in the health of those communities, because healthy communities are safe communities,” Harris said.
“There is no vaccine for racism,” she had said in her acceptance speech last month and criticised Trump for turing “our tragedies into political weapons”, she said.
“Donald Trump’s failure has cost lives and livelihoods,” Harris had said, referring to the racing tensions and the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the country.",world
Police arrest man for murder after UK stabbings," British police said on Monday they had arrested a man on suspicion of murder after a series of stabbings in the early hours of Sunday morning in the city of Birmingham left one person dead and seven others injured.
The 27-year-old suspect was detained in Selly Oak area of the city at 4am (local time), West Midlands police said. Detectives said the stabbings which took place in four locations over two hours were linked but appeared to be random and were not thought to be gang-related or connected to terrorism.
“Officers worked through yesterday and into the early hours of this morning in a bid to trace the man we believe responsible for these terrible crimes,” said Birmingham Police commander, chief superintendent Steve Graham.
“Clearly this is a crucial development but our investigation continues. We still need to speak to any witnesses who saw what happened who’ve not yet spoken to us, or anyone who may have video footage or photos of the incidents or the attacker.”

"Alexei Navalny out of coma, is responsive"," Poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's condition has improved, allowing doctors to take him out of an induced coma, the German hospital treating him said Monday.
Navalny, a fierce, high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany last month after falling ill on August 20 on a domestic flight in Russia.
German chemical weapons experts say tests show the 44-year-old was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent, prompting the German government last week to demand that Russia investigate the case.
The patient has been removed from his medically induced coma and is being weaned off mechanical ventilation,"" Berlin's Charite hospital said in a statement.
He is responding to verbal stimuli. It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.""
It added that the decision to publicly release details of his condition was made in consultation with Navalny's wife.
Navalny had been in an induced coma in the Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany on August 22 for treatment.
News of his gradual recovery came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office indicated that she might be willing to rethink the fate of a controversial German-Russian gas pipeline project a sign of Berlin's growing frustration over Moscow's stonewalling about the Navalny case.
German authorities said last week that tests showed proof without doubt that Navalny was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities identified the Soviet-era Novichok as the poison used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018.
Russia has denied that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and accused Germany failing to provide evidence about the poisoning that it requested in late August.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Sunday that the Russian reaction could determine whether Germany changes its long-standing backing for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will bring Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine.
The chancellor also believes that it's wrong to rule anything out, Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters Monday.
Previously, Merkel had insisted on decoupling the Navalny case from the pipeline project that is strongly opposed by the US and strongly favoured by Russia.

In August, three US Republican senators threatened sanctions against the operator of a German Baltic Sea port for its role as a staging post for ships involved in building Nord Stream 2.

Seibert cautioned that it was premature to expect Moscow to respond to the request for help with the Navalny probe within a few days, but made it clear that Berlin wants answers soon.

I can't express a clear, time-limited expectation, except that we are certainly not talking about months or the end of the year, he said.

German diplomats rejected the Russian suggestion that Berlin was to blame for any delay in investigating the case, noting that Navalny was first treated for suspected poisoning in the Siberian city of Omsk on August 20.

All evidence, witnesses, traces and so forth are in the place where the crime was committed, presumably somewhere in Siberia, said German Foreign Ministry spokesman Christofer Burger.

The co-leader of Germany's opposition Green party, Robert Habeck, called on the government to take a stronger stance and bury the pipeline project.

The project divides Europe, it is economically nonsensical and oversized, and it is wrong in security policy terms, Habeck said.
Completing it would mean that Russia can do what it wants. This signal must not be sent.
Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian envoy to international organizations in Vienna, voiced suspicions about the timing of demands to link the pipeline with the Navalny case.
Suspicious coincidence of Navalny case and the final stage of Nord Stream 2 construction, which some states desperately want to be closed. I am not fond of conspiracy theories but it is obvious that the tragic events with Navalny are very timely and helpful for opponents of NS2,"" he tweeted.",world
Oscar-winning Czech film director Jiri Menzel dies at 82," Oscar-winning Czech film director Jiri Menzel has died at the age of 82 following a long battle with serious health problems.
Menzel's wife, Olga, shared the news of the veteran filmmaker's demise on Facebook late Sunday.
""Our dear Jiri, the bravest of the brave. Your body left our mundane world in our arms last night, Olga wrote.
""Dearest Jirka, I thank you for each and single day I could spend with you. Each was extraordinary. I am also grateful to you for the last three years, as hard as they were,"" she added.
Born on 23 February 1938, Menzel studied film direction in Prague and graduated to become one of the leading figures of the Czechoslovak New Wave of cinema, alongside another Oscar winner, Milos Forman in the 1960s.

In 1967, Menzel won the best foreign language film Academy Award for his first directoral venture, a Nazi occupation story Closely Watched Trains.
The film was based on a novel by Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal and following the Oscar win, Menzel went on to adapt the novelist's other books -- Cutting it Short and Larks on a String.
Larks on a String , which depicted the life of people sidelined by the communist regime ruling in then-Czechoslovakia, was originally supposed to bow out in 1969. The film was banned by the authorities and only returned to the screens after the 1989 Velvet Revolution.
The director's other films based on Hrabal's books include Shortcuts (1981) and The Snowdrop Festival (1984).
Menzel earned his second Academy Award nomination in 1986 for the dark comedy My Sweet Little Village.
He was also a prolific theatre director, as well as an actor and writer, and was awarded the French title of Knight of Arts and Letters.
He played around 80 roles in film and television. His last acting gig was as the title character in the Czech-Slovak co-production drama directed by Martin Sulik, The Interpreter.
Menzel had been away from the spotlight since 2017 when he had a brain surgery and meningitis.
He is survived by his wife and two daughters, Anna Karolina and Eva Maria.",world
No fee refund for Covid flout dismissal," Northeastern University dismissed 11 first-year students this week and declined to refund their $36,500 tuition after they were discovered crowded into a room at a Boston hotel serving as a temporary dormitory, in one of the harshest punishments imposed to date against students for violations of Covid protocols 
About 800 students are staying in two-person rooms at the hotel, the Westin, which is less than a mile from Northeastern’s Boston campus.
Two university staff members making rounds on Wednesday evening discovered the gathering, which violated university rules against any “guests, visitors or additional occupants”, the university said in a news release.
In addition, the students were not wearing masks or practising social distancing, in defiance of university requirements, a university spokesperson, Renata Nyul, said.
Northeastern’s move comes as colleges across the country are struggling to figure out how to stop campus partying, which has already set off outbreaks at a number of schools and shut down some classes. The New York Times has counted at least 51,000 cases in universities and colleges around the country since the start of the pandemic, and many major college towns have become national hot spots.

Most colleges appear to be trying to sway students with warnings and pleas, and relying on peer pressure to moderate behaviour, but some are taking a more punitive approach. Purdue University suspended 36 students after a cooperative house was caught partying less than 24 hours after the university president outlawed off-campus parties. At the University of Connecticut, several students were evicted over a mask-free dorm bash.
The Northeastern students have the right to contest the action in an “expedited hearing”, the university said. The dismissed students will not be allowed to attend fall classes remotely, said Nyul, and they must start over as first-year enrollees if they come back.
They were notified on Friday that they would have to vacate the hotel within 24 hours, the university said, and before leaving, would have to be tested for the coronavirus at Northeastern. Anyone who tested positive would be moved into “wellness housing” at the university until they no longer had the virus.
“Students who attend an unsafe gathering, social or party, either on or off-campus, can expect suspension,” Madeleine Estabrook, senior VC for student affairs, had forewarned in a letter to students.",world

UK government to offer discount to revive cinema," The UK government is planning to introduce a so-called “Seat Out to Help Out” scheme to help theatres and other entertainment venues reopen after an extended period of coronavirus lockdown since earlier this year. 
According to The Sunday Times, the scheme will be modelled on UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s successful “Eat Out to Help Out” restaurant discount offering as a means to boost the coronavirus-hit hospitality sector. 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and culture secretary Oliver Dowden are said to be keen on the idea and have directed officials to work out a speedy strategy. 
“There have been meetings this week. Direction has been given at a very senior level to work at extreme pace on this. The PM is keen on making rapid progress,” a government official told the newspaper. 
“Rapid testing is seen as the thing that can unlock the issue of getting audiences back,” the official added.

As part of the entertainment sector equivalent of the dining out scheme, discounted tickets of around £10 (Rs 973) each alongside a meal discount before or after shows in a tie-up between theatres and nearby restaurants is being considered.
“It could be tickets for a tenner on a Monday, with a link to local restaurants,” the newspaper quoted a government source as saying. 
Plans for the new scheme follow Sunak’s just-concluded “Eat Out to Help Out” concept, which offered half-price food and non-alcoholic drinks up to a limit of £10 per person on Mondays to Wednesdays throughout August. Under the UK government’s roadmap for a phased lifting of lockdown restrictions to keep a handle on the spread of the coronavirus, November 1 is the first date at which social distancing might be lifted considerably for such venues. 
However, under plans being drafted, it is hoped that some large venues may be able to reopen sooner. In meetings last week, it has been agreed that theatres and sports venues will become key beneficiaries of the government’s Operation Moonshot programme, which aims to test up to 4 million people a day for the coronavirus using new saliva tests that give results in minutes. 
Proposals being worked on would see those with tickets for plays and football matches tested in advance and then chased up a few days after the event. Rules, which require social distancing and the wearing of masks at cultural venues mean theatres can operate at only 25 per cent capacity. 
Ministers have been told that to be financially viable that figure needs to be between 70 per cent and 80 per cent. Large sports venues need to be 60 per cent full.",world
1 dies in stabbing as UK knife crimes rise," A lone assailant is on the run in Birmingham after stabbing eight people, one of them fatally, at four separate locations over a two-hour period early on Sunday in what police described as “a major incident”.
Five victims were taken to the major trauma centre at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, which saved the life of Malala Yousafzai, then 15, after she had been shot by the Taliban in Pakistan in October 2012. Three of those admitted had suffered critical injuries and a man died shortly after arrival. Two other patients with non-life-threatening injuries were taken to the city’s Heartlands Hospital. An eighth patient with minor injuries did not need treatment from paramedics.
The West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said a rise in violence was “almost inevitable” due to the pandemic.
He told reporters: “I have been saying for some time, in the context of Covid-19, that a lot of the pent-up feelings people have, and not being able to get out, combined with people who are now unsure about their future and jobs; it was almost inevitable that we would see a growth in violence.
“I’m not saying that this is directly related to that, but nevertheless we are seeing now a growth of violence among younger people, particularly younger males. We’re seeing that growing across the region. My fear is that if we don’t address that and some of the underlying problems with some urgency, then we could see that grow.”

Knife crime, which declined sharply when the lockdown was rigorous, is picking up again with its relaxation. There were seven stabbings in London on Saturday.
On the stabbings in Birmingham, a statement released by West Midlands police said: “Detectives are following a number of lines of inquiry and we’ve increased our uniformed and armed response in the city. We’re urging anyone who witnessed anything or anyone who has any CCTV or mobile phone footage to get in contact as soon as possible, as the information you have may be crucial to our investigation.”
The first incident was at Constitution Hill where the first stabbing happened at 12:30am. It was followed by events at Livery Street, Irving Street and finally at Hurst Street, where the “Gay Village” meets the Chinese Quarter.
One eyewitness, David Nash, director of operations at the Village Inn in Hurst Street, who was running the bar on Saturday night, said: “We knew about it sometime between 2am and 2.15am when a guy — we presume it’s a guy —with a black hoodie was walking down Hurst Street away from the Hippodrome towards Sherlock Street, the lower end of Hurst Street — and somebody shouted, ‘Stop him he’s just stabbed somebody’.
“And then this person took off into the night down Hurst Street and then of course you can’t quite work out what had gone on.”
The area was soon “engulfed” with emergency service vehicles.
Chief superintendent Steve Graham said “unfortunately the suspect wasn’t caught and still hasn’t been”.
He added: “Already we’ve got people going down drains, we’ve got that level of detailed searches taking place which will hopefully reassure the people that we are doing everything we can do to trace the offender.”
He said a number of descriptions had come in of the suspect but the police were not releasing anything at this time, asking the public to come forward with any information or footage they had.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “All my thoughts are with those affected by the terrible incident.” 
Home secretary Priti Patel commented: “Our emergency services are working hard to find whoever is responsible and bring them to justice.”
Shabana Mahmood, the Pakistani-origin Labour member for Birmingham Ladywood, where the fatal stabbing took place, said: “It’s of concern to me — and I know it will be worrying everybody else in the city as well. I know that they have drafted in additional police officers. I know that there are officers — both armed and unarmed — across the city centre.”",world
Hong Kong erupts against deferred elections," Police fired rounds of pepper balls at protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday as hundreds took to the streets to demonstrate against the postponement of legislative elections and a new national security law imposed by China.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam postponed the September 6 election for seats in the Asian financial hub’s Legislative Council for a year in July because of a spike in coronavirus cases.
The move dealt a blow to the pro-democracy Opposition who had hoped to win a historic majority in the Council, where only half the seats are directly elected and the other half are appointed members who mostly support Beijing.
“Today is supposedly our voting day, we need to resist to fight back for our vote,” said a 70-year-old woman surnamed Wong as she marched with other demonstrators. Thousands of police were stationed around the bustling Kowloon peninsula as marchers waved placards and chanted popular anti-government slogans such as “liberate Hong Kong”. The police said they arrested at least 90 people, mainly for illegal gatherings.
Several well-known activists were arrested during the demonstration including Figo Chan, the vice-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung.

Famine lurks in coronavirus ruin," The first famines of the coronavirus era could soon hit four chronically food-deprived conflict areas — Yemen, South Sudan, northeast Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo — the top humanitarian official of the United Nations has warned.
In a letter to members of the Security Council, the official, Mark Lowcock, said the risk of famines in these areas had been intensified by “natural disasters, economic shocks and public-health crises, all compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic”. Together, he said, “these factors are endangering the lives of millions of women, men and children”.
The letter, which has not been made public, was conveyed by Lowcock’s office to the Security Council on Friday under its 2018 resolution requiring updates when “the risk of conflict-induced famine and widespread food insecurity” occurs. A copy of the letter was seen by The New York Times.
UN officials have said before that all four areas are vulnerable to acute food deprivation because of chronic armed conflicts and the inability of humanitarian relief providers to freely distribute aid.
In April, David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Programme, the anti-hunger arm of the UN, warned the Security Council that while the world was contending with the coronavirus pandemic, “we are also on the brink of a hunger pandemic”.

Lowcock, who is the UN’s under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, effectively escalated the warning, saying a lack of funding for emergency relief and the complications created by the coronavirus scourge have now pushed some of the world’s neediest populations closer to famine conditions.
Under a monitoring system for assessing hunger emergencies known as the Integrated Food Security Classification or IPC scale, Phase 3 is a crisis, Phase 4 is an emergency, and Phase 5 is famine — the worst — marked by “starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels”.
In Yemen, where famine was averted two years ago, Lowcock said “the risk is slowly returning”. The country, the poorest in the Arab world, has been ravaged for more than five years by a civil war between Houthi rebels and a Saudi-backed military coalition that has left 80 per cent of the country dependent on outside aid.
Lowcock said the Yemeni currency had basically collapsed, while food costs had surged and drinking water prices had more than doubled since April. In 16 districts of the country, nearly all in Houthi-controlled areas, he said, the hunger emergency is now at Phase 4 — one step from famine.
In the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where decades of conflict have worsened this year, Lowcock said 21 million people are living in “crisis or worse levels of food insecurity”.
In the northeast Nigeria states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, which have been roiled for years by armed extremist militants, Lowcock said more than 10 million people — four of five — now require humanitarian assistance and protection.
He said more than 1.2 million people in northeast Nigeria “remain largely inaccessible to aid agencies due to conflict and deliberate obstruction by non-state armed groups”, with more than 15 aid workers killed in the past year.
In South Sudan, which has been upended by seven years of civil war, a recent upsurge in violence has left more than 1.4 million people “facing crisis or worse levels of food insecurity”, Lowcock said. Two years after the threat of famine was narrowly averted in South Sudan, he said, “parts of the country are again deteriorating sharply”.

"Multiple stabbings In Birmingham; ‘Major Incident’, says UK police"," British police declared a ‘major incident’ early on Sunday after multiple people were stabbed in the centre of England's Birmingham city, the NDTV said in a report.
""We can confirm that at approximately 12:30am today (Sunday 6 September) we were called to reports of a stabbing in Birmingham city centre"", West Midlands Police said in a statement. ""A number of other stabbings"" were reported in the area shortly after and ""this has been declared a major incident"", the statement added.
""We are aware of a number of injured people, but at the moment we are not in a position to say how many or how serious. Police said that all emergency services are working together at the scene, and making sure that those who are injured receive medical care.
Cordons are in place, and there are some road closures.

Sweden’s light touch lowers cases," Sweden, whose Covid-19 death rate soared above its locked-down Scandinavian neighbours at the peak of the pandemic, now has a lower case rate than those of Denmark and Norway for the first time since March.
Anders Tegnell, the country’s state epidemiologist, said: “Sweden has gone from being one of the countries with the most infection in Europe, to one of those with the least infection in Europe, while many other countries have seen a rather dramatic increase.”
For those like Dr Tegnell, who have stood by Sweden’s light-touch lockdown strategy despite the country briefly suffering the highest per capita death rate in the world, in May, the numbers vindicate the approach.
“What we see now is that the sustainable policy might be slower in getting results, but it will get results eventually,” Dr Tegnell said.
“And then we also hope that the result will be more stable.”

According to numbers submitted to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Sweden registered an average of 12 new cases per million people over the past week, compared to 18 for Denmark and 14 for Norway.
The number of deaths is currently averaging at two to three per day, down from the peak of more than 100 a day it suffered in mid-April.
Denmark registered 179 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday, the highest daily number in more than four months. Stockholm, the centre of Sweden’s pandemic in April and May, registered the lowest number of new cases since March last week.
Moreover, a test last week of 2,500 randomly selected people found that not one had an active Covid-19 infection, compared to 0.9 per cent at the end of April and 0.3 per cent at the end of May.
“We interpret this as meaning there is not currently a widespread infection among people who do not have symptoms,” said Karin Tegmark Wisell of the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS).
Unlike Denmark and Norway, Sweden never instituted a lockdown, keeping kindergartens, most schools, bars, restaurants, shops and offices open throughout the pandemic. The PHAS, which sets the strategy, judged that it was better to rely on voluntary social distancing and self-isolation measures.
Sweden’s decline in cases comes as many of the European countries that used strict lockdowns to control the pandemic are struggling to prevent cases rising now that restrictions have been lifted.
Dr Tegnell said he believed that grandparents in Sweden, who have been advised to
stay isolated and avoid contact with grandchildren and children, may now be able to celebrate Christmas.
Sweden has so far reported 5,832 deaths due to coronavirus, more than six times as many as Denmark (264) and Norway (626) combined. Sweden is carrying out fewer tests per capita than Denmark and Norway, with an average of 1.2 per 1,000 people at the end of last month, compared to 2.2 in Norway and 5.9 in Denmark.
Lena Einhorn, a virologist and leading critic of Sweden’s strategy, said it did not make sense to compare case numbers because of these discrepancies, and said it is very unlikely that the countries will ever reach Sweden’s death rate.
“I think that’s impossible because treatments are getting better, we will hopefully have a vaccine by the beginning of next year, and they are so far behind us,” she said.
Søren Riis Paludan, a professor at Denmark’s Aarhus University specialising in viral infections, said the recent rise in cases in Denmark had been amplified by the country’s high level of testing. It was too early, he added, to judge whether Sweden having more cases had led to more immunity.

Climate protesters take aim at UK papers," The distribution of several British newspapers was disrupted on Saturday after Extinction Rebellion climate change activists blockaded printing presses used by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, the publisher of The Times and The Sun.
The group said late on Friday that nearly 80 people had blocked roads leading to two printworks, at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, north east of London, and at Knowsley, near Liverpool.
Hertfordshire police said they had made 42 arrests, while Merseyside police said they had made 21.
The Murdoch-owned Newsprinters’ works also print the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times.
 Extinction Rebellion said it took the action to highlight what it regards as the newspapers’ failure to accurately report on climate change.
 The protests, which continued on Saturday, were condemned by interior minister Priti Patel.
“This morning people across the country will be prevented from reading their newspaper because of the actions of Extinction Rebellion,” she said on Twitter.",world
Uproar over Trump slurs on soldiers," President Trump confronted a political crisis on Friday that could undercut badly needed support in the military community for his re-election campaign as he sought to dispute a report that he privately referred to American soldiers killed in combat as “losers” and “suckers”.
Trump, who has long portrayed himself as a champion of the armed forces and has boasted of rebuilding a military depleted after years of overseas wars, came under intense fire from Democrats and other opponents who said a report in The Atlantic demonstrated his actual contempt for those who serve their country in uniform.
The President’s foes organised conference calls, blasted out statements, flocked to television studios and quickly posted advertising online calling attention to the reported comments. At a news conference, former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr, the Democratic presidential nominee, grew emotional as he said that his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015, “wasn’t a sucker” for serving in the army in Iraq.
“How would you feel if you had a kid in Afghanistan right now?” Biden said. “How would you feel if you lost a son, daughter, husband, wife? How would you feel, for real?”
Biden called the reported comments “disgusting”, “sick”, “deplorable”, “un-American” and “absolutely damnable”, adding that he was closer to losing his temper than at any point during the campaign. “I’ve just never been as disappointed in my whole career with a leader that I’ve worked with, President or otherwise.”

Trump denied that he made the remarks repeatedly over the course of the day and rallied current and former aides who backed him up on the record. “It’s a fake story and it’s a disgrace that they’re allowed to do it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office, insisting that he respected the troops. “To me, they’re heroes,” he said. “It’s even hard to believe how they could do it. And I say that, the level of bravery, and to me, they’re absolute heroes.”
But he railed against one former military officer, John F. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who served as his White House chief of staff at the time of the reported episode and whom he seemed to blame for the article. “Didn’t do a good job, had no temperament and ultimately he was petered out,” Trump said when asked about Kelly on Friday evening. “He was exhausted. This man was totally exhausted. He wasn’t even able to function in the last number of months.”
The furore came at a time of rising tension between the commander in chief and the military leadership over his use of troops against protesters on American streets.
 A new poll by The Military Times showed Biden leading Trump with 41 per cent to 37 per cent among active-duty troops, a stark departure from the military’s longstanding support for Republicans and a danger sign for the President.
Recognising that, the President sought to smooth over friction with some in the military by abruptly reversing course on Friday afternoon and announcing that his administration would not be closing Stars and Stripes, the venerable military newspaper, by the end of the month after all.
While current and former officials contacted on Friday could not confirm some of the specifics in The Atlantic’s account, they did verify that Trump resisted supporting an official funeral and lowering flags after the death of Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Vietnam War hero whose military service he had disparaged.

Ailing man goes live on Facebook," A Frenchman suffering from a rare and incurable condition is livestreaming his death on social media as he refuses to take food, drink or medicine after President Emmanuel Macron turned down his request for euthanasia.

"AC explosion in Bangladesh mosque kills 12, injures 25"," At least 12 worshippers, including a child, were killed and 25 others injured when a suspected gas leak caused six air conditioners to explode almost simultaneously in a mosque on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, fire officials said on Saturday.

The explosions took place during prayers at around 9pm at the Baitul Salat mosque, at the Narayanganj river port town on Friday.
Twenty-five worshippers sustained burn injuries in the blast, according to media reports.

While 11 worshippers died during treatment on Saturday, a boy succumbed to his injuries on Friday, said Dr Samantha Lal Sen, chief of state-run Dhaka Medical College Hospital's burn unit, the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery.

He said 25 others are now being treated at the unit, but their condition was very critical as the burn caused more than 90 per cent damage to their bodies.

Almost all of them have inhalation burns, he said, adding that prime minister Sheikh Hasina called him this morning and expressed concern for the injured and directed to ensure all possible medical care for them.

Fire officials suspect accumulated gas from a leaking pipeline caused a fire that might have triggered the air conditioners to explode.

""A pipeline of Titas Gas passes beneath the mosque. We are suspecting that gas leaked from the pipeline and accumulated inside as the windows were closed. The explosion was probably triggered due to sparks when someone tried to switch on or off the ACs or fans,"" Narayanganj Fire Service's deputy assistant director Abdullah Al Arefin was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.

Witnesses said they found five to six people coming out of the mosque as soon as the blast occurred. Worshipers, most of them severely burnt, were found lying on the floor, the report said.

The Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence, state gas transmission and distribution agency Titas and the district administration of Narayanganj each formed a committee to investigate the near-simultaneous explosions.",world
"When Nixon called Indians most sexless, pathetic"," Newly declassified White House tapes disclose former US president Richard Nixon speaking disparagingly about Indians and reveal the bigotry he and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger held that influenced US policy towards India and South Asia under his presidency.
""As Americans grapple with problems of racism and power, a newly declassified trove of White House tapes provides startling evidence of the bigotry voiced by President Richard M. Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser, Gary Bass, professor at Princeton, wrote in an opinion piece titled, “The Terrible Cost of Presidential Racism” in The New York Times.
The full content of these tapes reveal how US policy towards South Asia under Mr Nixon was influenced by his hatred of, and sexual repulsion toward, Indians, Bass, author of “The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger and a Forgotten Genocide”, writes.
Richard Nixon, a Republican, was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 until 1974.
Bass says that the declassified White House tapes reveal a stunning ""conversation between Nixon, Kissinger and the then White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman in the Oval Office in June 1971 in which Nixon asserts in a venomous tone that Indian women are undoubtedly the most unattractive women in the world.""
Nixon also calls Indians most sexless, nothing and pathetic, according to the tapes.
On November 4, 1971, during a private break from a contentious White House summit with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the president harangued Kissinger about his sexual disgust at Indians, Bass writes.
Referring to Indians, Nixon says to Kissinger, ""To me, they turn me off. How the hell do they turn other people on, Henry? Tell me”. Bass writes that while Kissinger's response is inaudible in the tapes, it did not discourage the president from his theme.
In November 1971, in the middle of a discussion about India-Pakistan tensions with Kissinger and secretary of state William Rogers, after Rogers mentioned reprimanding Gandhi, the president blurted, “I don't know how they reproduce!”
Bass writes in the NYT piece that while Kissinger has portrayed himself as being above the racism of the Nixon White House, the tapes show him joining in the bigotry, though the tapes cannot determine whether he truly shared the president's prejudices or was just pandering to him.
For instance, on June 3, 1971, Kissinger was indignant at the Indians as the country sheltered millions of Bengali refugees who had fled the Pakistan Army. Kissinger blamed the Indians for causing the refugee flow and then condemned Indians as a whole, as he said, “They are a scavenging people”.
At one point, Kissinger had said Indians “are superb flatterers” and masters at flattery. “They are masters at subtle flattery. That's how they survived 600 years. They suck up their great skill is to suck up to people in key positions.”
Nixon had even been furious with his ambassador to India Kenneth Keating, who two days earlier had confronted Nixon and Kissinger in the Oval Office, calling Pakistan's crackdown almost entirely a matter of genocide.
Bass says that Nixon and Kissinger had staunchly supported the military regime in Pakistan as it killed hundreds of thousands of Bengalis, with 10 million refugees fleeing into neighbouring India.
Voicing prejudices about Pakistanis, Kissinger had in August 1971 told Nixon that the Pakistanis are fine people, but they are “primitive in their mental structure”.
He added, “They just don't have the subtlety of the Indians.”
These emotional displays of prejudice help to explain a foreign policy debacle, Bass says, adding that Nixon and Kissinger's policies toward South Asia in 1971 were not just a moral disaster but a strategic fiasco on their own Cold War terms.
While Nixon and Kissinger had some reasons to favour Pakistan, an American ally which was secretly helping to bring about their historic opening to China, their biases and emotions contributed to their excessive support for Pakistan's murderous dictatorship throughout its atrocities, Bass said.
""For decades, Mr Nixon and Mr Kissinger have portrayed themselves as brilliant practitioners of realpolitik, running a foreign policy that dispassionately served the interests of the United States.
""But these declassified White House tapes confirm a starkly different picture: racism and misogyny at the highest levels, covered up for decades under ludicrous claims of national security. A fair historical assessment of Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger must include the full truth, unbleeped,” Bass says.
In December 2012, Bass had filed a legal request for a mandatory declassification review with the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.
The Nixon archivists released a few unbleeped tapes in May 2018, July 2019 and this May after considerable wrangling.

'Very nasty' situation along India-China border: Donald Trump,"   Describing the situation along the India-China border as ""very nasty , US President Donald Trump has said that the Chinese are ""going at it much more strongly"" than a lot of people understand and he would ""love to get involved and help"" ease the tension.
Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter standoff in multiple places in eastern Ladakh for four months. Tensions flared up again in the region after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of the Pangong lake six days ago when the two sides were engaged in diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row.
""While we're at it, we're talking about China and India are going at it pretty good on the border, as you know. It's been very nasty, Trump told reporters on Friday at a White House news conference in response to a question on Indian-Americans and the US-India relationship.
Trump reiterated that he is talking to both India and China about the situation.
And we stand ready to help with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help. And we are talking to both countries about that, he said.
His comments came on a day when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held talks with his Chinese counterpart Gen. Wei Fenghe in Moscow with a focus on easing escalating border tension in eastern Ladakh. They met on the sidelines of a meeting of the defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
When asked if China is bullying India, he said that he hoped it is not the case but noted that China is ""certainly going at it"".
I hope not... But they (China) are certainly going at it. They are going at it much more strongly than a lot of people even understand, Trump said in response to a question.",world
Right to mock is an essential part of being French: Emmanuel Macron," The right to mock and caricature, even religion, is an essential part of being French, President Emmanuel Macron said at a naturalisation ceremony on Friday, days after the start of a trial of the accused accomplices in an attack by Islamist gunmen on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015.
In the Paris Pantheon, a mausoleum to France’s heroes, Macron handed five new citizens their French papers in a solemn ceremony to mark the 150th anniversary of the Third Republic.
“At the start of the trial of the attacks of January 2015, I say that to be French is to defend the right to laugh, jest, mock and caricature, of which Voltaire maintained that it is the source of all other rights,” Macron said. More than a dozen defendants went on trial this week for their role in the killing spree in the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people died.
 Welcoming five new citizens from Britain, Algeria, Cameroun, Peru and Lebanon, Macron said immigrants have long been a force for good in France, and noted that the Third Republic was proclaimed from Paris city hall by the son of an Italian immigrant, Leon Gambetta, on September 4, 1870.
“He was, like you, a son of immigrants, French of mixed blood. It was he who resuscitated the republic, this reign of freedom,” Macron said.
 Macron said many other immigrants have shaped French history, including Polish-born scientist Marie Curie, American-born singer Josephine Baker, Tunisian-born feminist Gisele Alimi, and Felix Eboue, France’s first Black colonial governor and first Black man to have his ashes placed in the Pantheon.

Robert Pattinson tests positive for Covid-19," Batman star Robert Pattinson has tested positive for Covid-19, bringing production of the £100 million movie, which resumed only three days ago near London, to an expensive halt.
Many of the crew have found it ironic that Batman has been brought down by a virus widely believed to have originated from bats in China.
“There is an irony to all this in that you would think Batman would be immune seeing as it all started from bats,” quipped an insider.
Without identifying 34-year-old Pattinson, Warner Bros. confirmed in a statement: “A member of The Batman production has tested positive for Covid-19, and is isolating in accordance with established protocols. Filming is temporarily paused.”
Vanity Fair and the Hollywood Reporter said the person who tested positive was Pattinson, who plays the caped crusader in the new blockbuster.

Pattinson, best known for his roles in the Twilight saga movies, follows in the footsteps of Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, Val Kilmer and George Clooney in playing the Dark Knight. He took on the role last year after Affleck, who had been developing the ninth film featuring Batman, dropped out.
Production crews had gathered at the studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, in August to work on sets. Filming at the studios, where the Harry Potter movies were also made, is taking place under the working title of Vengeance.
A crew member revealed: “We have been sent a memo telling us that a member of the crew has had a positive Covid-19 test.
“Everyone was looking forward to getting back to work and it has come as a blow that production has stopped just three days after we began filming. We have all been told to stand down until further notice and we are not expecting to be back filming for at least two weeks.”
Production on Batman had resumed after a break of nearly six months due to the pandemic. Filming on the DC Comics feature began in Glasgow earlier this year, and director Matt Reeves has said only a quarter of the movie has been shot so far.
A two-week shutdown will cost Warner Bros an estimated £5m and possibly even delay the release of the movie beyond October 2021. When production was previously halted in March, Pattinson had to stay in the UK along with several cast members.
Others who live in Los Angeles returned to the UK but had to stay in quarantine for two weeks before turning up on the set in accordance with government regulations.
The new film, which is said to be a grittier take on the DC comic book hero, sees Batman pitted against his usual enemies with Paul Dano playing The Riddler. Zoe Kravitz stars as Catwoman and John Turturro portrays crime boss Carmine Falcone.
The producers are “working round the clock” to see if any parts of the movie can be shot without its leading mean in order to minimise losses.",world
New HK law infringes on fundamental rights: UN," UN human rights experts have told China a new security law for Hong Kong “infringes on certain fundamental rights” and voiced concerns that it could be used to prosecute political activists in the former British colony.
In a rare joint letter made public on Friday, 48 hours after it was sent to the Chinese government, they also said provisions of the new law appear to undermine the independence of Hong Kong’s judges and lawyers, and the right to freedom of expression.
The “open letter” reflected a detailed legal analysis of the national security law imposed in Hong Kong on June 30, which had already drawn UN criticism before its adoption.
The law allows for anything China views as subversive, secessionist, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces to be punished with up to life in prison. Authorities in Beijing and the financial centre have said the law is necessary to ensure Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity.
Critics say the legislation further erodes the wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong on its return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement.

Tibet: China planning $146 billion for infrastructure investment," China is planning a more than 1 trillion yuan ($146 billion) push to accelerate infrastructure investment in Tibet, including new and previously announced projects, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The renewed push to step-up development of the remote and impoverished southwestern region signals Beijing’s intent to bolster frontier security amid heightened border tensions with India in recent months, two of the sources said.
Last week, during a senior Communist Party meeting on Tibet's future governance, President Xi Jinping lauded achievements and praised frontline officials but said more efforts were needed to enrich, rejuvenate and strengthen unity in the region.
He said a number of major infrastructure projects and public facilities would be completed, including the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, according to remarks published by the official Xinhua news agency.
The construction plans include completion of the challenging middle section of a high-elevation Sichuan-Tibet railway link, a railway line between Nepal and Tibet that has remained in the planning stages, and a newly planned dry port in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the sources said.

The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with the media.
It was not immediately clear how much of the targeted spending is new, or over how many years it would be invested.
China’s State Council Information Office and the Tibet regional government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Construction on the most difficult section of the Sichuan-Tibet railway — linking Chengdu with Lhasa — will begin in coming weeks, said two of the sources.
The 270 billion yuan section of the railway has been known for construction challenges posed by rough terrain and complex geology, notably the segment linking Sichuan’s Ya’an city with Nyingchi in southeastern Tibet near the border with India.
Beijing also wants to push ahead with the Tibet-Nepal Railway linking Kathmandu with Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet, which was among a number of bilateral deals signed in 2018 between Nepal and China.",world
"Russian candidate vaccine safe, claims paper"," Russia’s candidate vaccine against Covid-19 is safe and generates an immune response, Russian researchers said on Friday in their first scientific paper on the vaccine that they want mass produced in India and some other countries.
Early trials on their candidate vaccine on 76 healthy volunteers have found them eliciting an antibody response in the recipients without any serious side-effects, the scientists from the Gamaleya National Research Centre said.
A senior Russian official told a global media conference on Friday that Russia was talking to the Indian government about the candidate vaccine and had “achieved agreements” with leading companies.
While the detection of an antibody response is encouraging, the scientists have themselves cautioned that further investigation is necessary to determine whether the vaccine can prevent Covid-19 in immunised people.
The results of their trials have been published in The Lancet, a medical research journal. Vaccine researchers view the findings as “encouraging” but have underlined that larger and long-term studies and comparisons with placebo are yet to be done.
The findings are “encouraging but small”, Naor Bar-Zeev, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US, wrote in a commentary in the journal. “The immunogenicity bodes well…. Clinical efficacy for any Covid-19 vaccine has not yet been shown.”
The two-part vaccine is made up of two types of the human adenovirus, genetically engineered to express a key coronavirus protein and weakened so that they cannot replicate or cause disease in humans.
The decision by Russian regulators last month to approve the vaccine ahead of critical large-scale efficacy trials that would have determined whether it can actually protect people from Covid-19 had surprised many scientists.
The Russian researchers have reaffirmed their confidence in their candidate vaccines, which they say are based on robust technology. Russia plans to immunise 40,000 people in the coming weeks.
The Russia Direct Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund created by the Russian government for joint partnerships, had last month signalled its intention to conduct clinical trials and seek mass production of the vaccine in India.
“We are in a close dialogue with the corresponding ministries in India, the Indian government and the leading (vaccine) manufacturers regarding (local) production of the vaccine in India,” Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer at the RDIF, told a global media conference.
“We have achieved certain agreements with the leading companies and we recognise India and its potential to become one of the hubs for production of the vaccine, not just for the Indian market but also for other countries,” Dmitriev added.
He said Russia appreciated that Indian researchers asked questions about how the vaccine works.
“We appreciated that they did not start to attack the vaccine and first tried to understand it and in their desire to understand our vaccine, they got to realise that the approach based on the human adenovirus vaccine platform is the most reasonable approach,” he said.
Thirty-four candidate vaccines worldwide are under human trial. 
Some scientists have predicted that the earliest commercial vaccines might emerge by early 2021.",world
Trump denies he called World War I marines ‘losers’ and ‘suckers’," President Trump heatedly denied on Thursday night that he referred to American soldiers killed in combat during World War I as “losers” and “suckers”, moving quickly to avoid losing support among the military and its allies just two months before an election.
Marching over to reporters under the wing of Air Force One after returning from a campaign rally, a visibly angry Trump rebutted a magazine report that he decided against visiting a cemetery for American soldiers in France in 2018 because he feared the rain would mess up his hair and he did not believe it was important to honour the war dead.
“If people really exist that would have said that, they’re lowlifes and they’re liars,” Trump shouted above the noise of the plane’s engines.
 “And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more.” 
He added, “What animal would say such a thing?”
The report in The Atlantic magazine by its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, attributed the episode to “four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day”, 
but he did not name them. During a conversation with senior officials that day, according to the magazine, Trump said: “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” 
On the same trip, the article said, he referred to American Marines slain in combat at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.
The article also said that Trump’s well-known antipathy for Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona and Vietnam War hero, was on display after the senator’s death in August 2018. “We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,” the article quotes Trump telling his staff. He became furious at seeing flags lowered to half-staff. “What the f*** are we doing that for? Guy was a f****** loser,” the President told aides, according to the article.
The report could be problematic for Trump because he is counting on strong support among the military for his re-election bid. 
He has made his backing for increased military spending, troop pay raises and improved veterans care pillars of his campaign at the same time he boasts of ratcheting down “endless wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But he has also clashed with the military leadership by extending clemency to accused and convicted war criminals, seeking to order active-duty forces into the streets of Washington to crack down on demonstrations and trying to block an effort to change the names of army bases named for Confederate generals.
A new poll by The Military Times taken before the party conventions last month and released this week showed former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr leading Trump with 41 percent to 37 per cent among active-duty troops, a stark departure from the military’s longstanding support for Republicans.
People familiar with Trump’s comments say he has long scorned those who served in Vietnam as being too dumb to have gotten out of it, as he did through a medical diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels. At other times, according to those familiar with the remarks, Trump would marvel at people choosing military service over making money.
Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, sought on Thursday night to capitalise on the Atlantic article, quickly issuing a statement condemning the president and saying it demonstrated that Trump was not fit for the office. 
Biden said the article, if true, showed “another marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the President of the United States”.
“I have long said that, as a nation, we have many obligations, but we only have one truly sacred obligation — to prepare and equip those we send into harm’s way, and to care for them and their families, both while they are deployed and after they return home. That’s the foundation of what Jill and I believe,” said Biden, whose late son, Beau Biden, served overseas.

"Let them vote twice, advises Trump"," US President Donald Trump suggested on Wednesday that people in the state of North Carolina should vote twice in the November election, once in person and once by mail, although doing so is a crime.
“Let them send it in and let them go vote,” Trump said in an interview with WECT-TV in Wilmington, North Carolina, when asked about the security of mail-in votes. “And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won’t be able to vote” in person.
Voting more than once in an election is illegal.
“President Trump outrageously encouraged” North Carolinians “to break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election”. state attorney-general Josh Stein said in a tweet. “Make sure you vote, but do NOT vote twice! I will do everything in my power to make sure the will of the people is upheld in November.”
US attorney-general William Barr told CNN that Trump “was trying to make the point that the ability to monitor this system is not good”. Told that voting twice is illegal, he said,
“I don't know what the law in the particular state says.”
Barr said mail-in ballots for the November 3 election could be vulnerable to fraud, echoing an argument Trump has made to denounce the use of voting by mail.
Trump has previously said the voting method is susceptible to large-scale fraud, although experts say voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the US.
Voting by mail is not new in the United States — nearly one in four voters cast presidential ballots in 2016 that way.",world
"Jimmy Lai not guilty of intimidation, says HK court"," A Hong Kong court declared media tycoon and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai not guilty of criminal intimidation on Thursday, ending one several cases against him after his high-profile arrest last month under a new national security law.
Thursday’s verdict was for a case that dates back to 2017 and was unrelated to his arrest. Lai, who is a key critic of Beijing, had used foul language when confronting a reporter from Oriental Daily News, a major competitor to Lai’s tabloid Apple Daily. 
Police, however, only charged him in February this year.
The mainland-born media magnate had pleaded not guilty.
Dressed in a light grey suit and green shirt, he smiled after the verdict was read out and shook hands with supporters who filled the courtroom.

"‘The Rock’, family recover from Covid"," Pro-wrestler turned Hollywood actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson said in a video message posted on social media on Wednesday that he, his wife and their two young children tested positive for Covid-19 in recent weeks but that they all have recovered and are healthy.
Johnson, 48, said in the Instagram post that he and his spouse, Lauren, 35, and their daughters, Jasmine, 4, and Tiana, 2, caught the virus about two-and-a-half weeks ago from “very close family friends” whom he said had no idea how they had become infected.
“I can tell you this has been one of the most challenging and difficult things we have ever had to endure as a family, and for me personally,” he said in the video.
The actor said his family, like their friends who caught the virus first, had been “incredibly disciplined” about adhering to safety measures to avoid the virus. 
The two young girls suffered only “a little sore throat the first couple of days” and bounced back, though Johnson and his wife had “a rough go”, he said.

Nancy Pelosi apologises for salon visit ‘set-up’," A testy Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday she takes responsibility for trusting the word of a San Francisco hair salon that it was OK to come in for a solo visit — even though the city still does not allow indoor beauty services because of the coronavirus pandemic.  
But the Democratic House Speaker called Monday’s visit a “set-up” and said the salon owes her an apology for misrepresenting city health orders. 
“I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighbourhood salon that I’ve been to over the years many times, and that when they said ... we’re able to accommodate people one person at a time, and that we can set up that time, I trusted that,” Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday.
“As it turns out, it was a set-up.” “I take responsibility for falling for a set-up,” she said. 
An attorney for the man who did her hair also said Pelosi appeared to have been set up.

Matthew Soleimanpour said his client received permission from the salon owner a day earlier to make the appointment. 
During that telephone call the owner, Erica Kious, “made several vitriolic and incendiary comments about Speaker Pelosi”, Soleimanpour said in a statement. 
“It appears Kious is furthering a set-up of Speaker Pelosi for her own vain aspirations,” the statement said. 
Pelosi is facing fierce backlash after Fox News aired surveillance footage from the salon that showed her walking through the salon with her hair wet and with a mask around her neck rather than on her face. In the clip, a masked stylist follows her. 
Critics, including President Donald Trump, called her a hypocrite and asked why she did not know the coronavirus-related rules in her home city.
Kious, owner of ESalon SF in the city’s upscale Cow Hollow district, told Fox News that she rents chairs to stylists, and one of them informed her in advance that Pelosi wanted a wash and blow dry. 
California guidelines on salons vary by county, but stringent San Francisco officials have not yet permitted indoor salons to open.
Kious said she considered Pelosi getting her hair done “a slap in the face” to struggling business owners. 
However, in his statement, Soleimanpour said photographs and other information show that Kious had been performing indoor services since at least April without wearing a mask, and she also had been encouraging “and almost forcing stylists” to work. 
Kious did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The AP. 
Health order violations can be punished by a fine, imprisonment or both. But San Francisco has stressed education over enforcement and has been reluctant to penalise businesses and individuals. 
Pelosi said on Wednesday she would not answer any more questions about the visit and asked at one point whether reporters had any questions  “about the fact that people are dying”, referring to the HEROES Act legislation she called the news conference to address.",world
UK probe into Uighur claims of ‘genocide’," A prominent British human rights lawyer is convening an independent tribunal in London to investigate whether the Chinese government’s alleged rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in the far western Xinjiang region constitute genocide or crimes against humanity. 
The tribunal is expected to reveal new evidence and testimony over several days’ hearings next year. While the tribunal does not have government backing, it is the latest attempt to hold China accountable for its treatment of the Uighurs and ethnic Turkic minorities, who have been subject to an unprecedented crackdown since 2017. 
Barrister Geoffrey Nice, who previously led the prosecution of ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic over the Balkans war and worked with the International Criminal Court, was asked by the World Uighur Congress to investigate “ongoing atrocities and possible genocide” against the Uighur people. 
Allegations against China about potential genocide are “questions that should be asked and answered” but such claims have never been legally scrutinised in public, Nice told The Associated Press. Organisers are in the initial stages of gathering evidence, and expect to receive a substantial number of submissions from Uighurs exiled abroad over the next few months.     
New evidence that may emerge includes testimony from several former security guards who were involved in the Xinjiang detention camps.  “At the moment, the strongest evidence would appear to be evidence of incarceration and possibly evidence of enforced sterilisation,” Nice said.

A recent investigation by the AP found that the Chinese government is systematically forcing birth control on Uighurs and other Muslims in an apparent effort to reduce their population. 
The report found that authorities regularly subject minority women to pregnancy checks and force intrauterine devices, sterilisation and abortion on thousands. 
While scores have been thrown in detention camps for alleged “religious extremism”, many others were sent to the camps simply for having too many children. Such enforced sterilisation practices could breach the Genocide Convention, Nice said. ",world
US hints at October Covid vaccine surprise," The US federal government has told states to prepare for a coronavirus vaccine to be ready to distribute by November 1. 
The timeline raised concern among public health experts about an “October surprise” — a vaccine approval driven by political considerations ahead of a presidential election, rather than science.
In a letter to governors dated August 27, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said states “in the near future” will receive permit applications from McKesson Corp, which has contracted with CDC to distribute vaccines to places including state and local health departments and hospitals. 
“CDC urgently requests your assistance in expediting applications for these distribution facilities and, if necessary, asks that you consider waiving requirements that would prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by November 1, 2020,” Redfield wrote. 
He wrote that any waivers will not compromise the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. The Associated Press obtained the letter, which was first reported by McClatchy. 
The CDC also sent three planning documents to some health departments that included possible timelines for when vaccines would be available. 
The documents are to be used to develop plans for early vaccination when the supply might be constrained, according to one of the documents, which outlined a scenario in which a vaccine could be available as soon as the end of October. 
“The Covid-19 vaccine landscape is evolving and uncertain, and these scenarios may evolve as more information is available,” the document reads. Another of the documents says that limited Covid-19 vaccine doses may be available by early November and that supply will increase substantially in 2021.
It also states that initially available vaccines will either be approved by the Food and Drug Administration or authorised by the agency under its emergency powers. 
The documents encourage health officials to work out now which groups to prioritise for a vaccine, identify providers who will administer vaccine, and take other steps to prepare. The planning documents were first reported by The New York Times. 
Redfield told Yahoo Finance that officials were preparing “for what I anticipate will be reality, is that there'll be one or more vaccines available for us in November, December”.
James S. Blumenstock, a senior vice president at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the CDC was offering “an aggressive but necessary timetable” and that public health agencies were mobilising to prepare detailed plans. 
Several public health experts pointed out that final stage trials of experimental vaccines are still recruiting, and are at best halfway through that process. 
The vaccines are two doses, and each is given a month apart. The experts told the AP they did not understand how there could be adequate data on whether the vaccines work and are safe before November 1. 
“Being ready is reasonable. Cutting short phase 3 trials before you get the information you need isn’t,” said Dr Paul Offit, a Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia immunisation expert who sits on the FDA’s advisory committee. 
Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor University’s tropical medicine school, said he was “very concerned” about whether the FDA would use an emergency use authorisation to approve a vaccine before knowing whether it works and is safe. “It gives the appearance of a stunt rather than an expression of public health concern, Hotez said. 
FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn previously said the agency wouldn’t cut corners in evaluating vaccines. He told the Financial Times this week that it might be “appropriate” to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks.",world
FB moves to limit poll chaos in November," Facebook on Thursday moved to clamp down on any confusion about the November election on its service, rolling out a series of changes to limit voter misinformation and to prevent interference from President Trump and other politicians.
The social network, in one of its most sweeping sets of election actions, said it planned to bar any new political ads on its site in the week before Election Day. It said it would also strengthen measures against posts that try to dissuade people from voting. 
Post-election, Facebook said it would quash any candidates’ attempts at claiming false victories by redirecting users to accurate information on the results.
Facebook is bracing for what is set to be a highly contentious presidential election. With two months to go, President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr have ratcheted up their attacks against each other, clashing over issues including the coronavirus pandemic and racial unrest. Even when the results are in,  Trump has suggested that he may not accept them and has questioned the legitimacy of mail-in voting.
“This election is not going to be business as usual,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, wrote in a post. He said he was concerned about the challenges that people could face when voting in a pandemic and how the count might take days or weeks to finalise, potentially leading to more unrest. As a result, he said, “we all have a responsibility to protect our democracy”.

Facebook has become a key battleground for both Trump’s and Biden’s campaigns. Trump’s campaign has run ads on the social network featuring false corruption accusations about Biden. 
Biden’s campaign has criticised Facebook for allowing lies, while also spending millions of dollars to buy ads on the service to appeal to voters.
The social network is striving to prevent itself from being misused. It also wanted to keep either Republicans or Democrats from saying that it unduly influenced voters. In particular, the Silicon Valley company wants to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Russians used the service to sway the American electorate with divisive messaging to promote Trump.
At the time, Zuckerberg shrugged off the idea that his social network had influenced the election and Trump’s victory. After evidence of Russian meddling through Facebook became overwhelming, Zuckerberg spent billions of dollars to secure the social network, hired thousands of employees to focus on security, and worked with intelligence agencies and other tech companies to guard against foreign meddling.
Even so, Facebook has continued to face criticism as domestic misinformation about this year’s election — including from Trump — has proliferated. Zuckerberg has declined to remove much of that false information, saying that Facebook supports free speech. 
Many of the company’s own employees have objected to that position.
On Tuesday, Facebook said the Kremlin-backed group that interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the internet Research Agency, tried to meddle on its service again using fake accounts and a website set up to look like a Left-wing news site. 
Facebook said it was warned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the Russian effort and removed the fake accounts and news site before they had gained much traction.
Thursday’s changes, which are a tacit acknowledgment by Facebook of how powerful its effect on public discourse can be, are unlikely to satisfy its critics. Some of its measures, such as the blocking of new political ads a week before Election Day, are temporary. 
Yet they demonstrate that Facebook has sweeping abilities to shut down untruthful ads should it choose to do so.
Facebook said it would begin barring politicians from placing new ads on Facebook and Instagram, the photo-sharing service it owns, starting on October 27. 
Existing political ads will not be affected. Political candidates will still be able to adjust both the groups of people their existing ads are targeting and the amount of money they spend on those ads. They can resume running new political ads after Election Day, the company said.
In another change, Facebook said it would place what it calls its voting information centre — a hub for finding accurate, up-to-date information on how to register to vote, and when and where to do so — at the top of its News Feed, which is seen daily by millions, till Election Day. The company had rolled out the voter information centre in June and has continued promoting it to users.
To curb misinformation about voting, Facebook said it would remove posts that tell people they will catch Covid-19 if they take part in voting. For posts that use the coronavirus to discourage people from voting in other, less obvious ways, the company said it would attach a label and link to its voter information centre.

Pol Pot executioner ‘Comrade Duch’ dead," The Khmer Rouge commander known as “Comrade Duch”, Pol Pot’s premier executioner and security chief who oversaw the mass murder of at least 14,000 Cambodians at the notorious Tuol Sleng prison, died on Wednesday. He was 77.
Kaing Guek Eav or Comrade Duch was the first member of the Khmer Rouge leadership to face trial for his role within a regime blamed for at least 1.7 million deaths in the “killing fields” of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.
Duch died at 00.52am (1752 GMT on Tuesday) at the Khmer Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh, Khmer Rouge tribunal spokesman Neth Pheaktra said. He gave no details of the cause, but Duch had been ill in recent years.
In 2010, a UN tribunal found him guilty of mass murder, torture and crimes against humanity at Tuol Sleng prison, the former Phnom Penh high school which still stands as a memorial to the atrocities committed inside.
 He was given a life sentence two years later after his appeal that he was just a junior official following orders was rejected.
Duch expressed regret for his crimes.
Under Duch’s leadership, detainees at Tuol Sleng prison, codenamed “S-21”, were ordered to suppress cries of agony as Khmer Rouge guards, many of whom were teenagers, sought to extract confessions for non-existent crimes through torture. The guards were instructed to “smash to bits” traitors and counter-revolutionaries.",world
A Kennedy in a first Massachusetts loss," Senator Edward J. Markey turned back a primary challenge on Tuesday from Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, handing the Kennedy family its first-ever electoral loss in Massachusetts and demonstrating the growing strength of the progressive Left.
Forging a coalition of younger Democrats, the sort of voters who once formed the core of the Kennedy base, Markey was winning about 54 per cent of the vote when Kennedy called to concede.
By winning renomination in a generational clash — and the marquee Democratic Senate primary of the year — Markey, 74, proved that the ascendant Left is not eager to simply throw out long-serving incumbents in favour of younger rivals, such as the 39-year-old Kennedy.
Markey, who was first elected to Congress in 1976, was able to outflank Kennedy with progressives, leaving the heir of Massachusetts’s most storied political dynasty little opening.
Claiming victory, and wearing the same Nike Air Revolutions that became his signature as a late-in-life hipster, Markey elevated his millennial supporters and the Green New Deal they rallied around. “Tonight’s victory is a tribute to those young people,” he said, vowing that “the age of incrementalism is over”.

It was the sort of exhortation that Robert F. Kennedy could have easily delivered. But even as his grandson highlighted his family name in a final mail and TV blitz, today’s liberals were scarcely moved.
Addressing supporters in Watertown, Massachusetts, Kennedy said he “would do this again with all of you in a heartbeat”.
He called Markey “a good man,” but hinted at some of the bitterness that overtook the last stages of the race, when the senator invoked Kennedy’s forebears. Addressing his family, and noting that their “name was invoked far more often than I anticipated in this race”,  Kennedy said: “You are my heroes.”
He was uneasy from the start of the campaign about trading on his legacy, a reluctance that mystified some of his allies, who thought he was not wielding his most enviable asset.
Kennedy’s more fundamental problem, however, may have been that he simply never gave voters a coherent reason for why he should replace Markey, who was generally well-liked and underestimated by many Massachusetts Democrats.
Satisfied with the incumbent, happy to see him embrace a progressive agenda and wary of Kennedy’s ambitions, the state’s many liberal voters made the difference.

Navalny ‘was poisoned with nerve agent’," The Russian Opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, currently under treatment in a German hospital, was poisoned with a deadly nerve agent from the Novichok family, the German government said on Wednesday.
Citing what it called “unequivocal evidence”, Berlin demanded an explanation from Moscow in a case that seems bound to raise tensions between Russia and the West.
“Navalny has been the victim of a crime,” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said in a statement. “It raises very serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer.”
Novichok, a Soviet-era weapon invented for military use, was used against Sergei V. Skripal, a former Soviet spy, and his daughter in a 2018 attack in Salisbury, England, that the British government attributed to Russia’s military intelligence arm, the GRU.
At the time of the Skripal poisoning, experts said that the stockpile of Novichok was tightly guarded, and expressed doubts that the substance would be used by anyone other than a state-sponsored agent.
Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s chief of staff, echoed that view in a Twitter post on Wednesday, saying, “In 2020, poisoning Navalny with Novichok is the same as leaving an autograph at the scene of the crime.”
Toxicology tests carried out by a German Army laboratory revealed the “doubtless presence of a nerve agent from the Novichok group” in the system of Navalny, who was flown to Germany on August 22 after he collapsed on a flight from Siberia to Moscow.
“The German government condemns this attack in the strongest possible terms,” Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said in a statement. “The Russian government is urgently requested to explain what happened.”
The Kremlin said it had not been not informed of Germany’s findings before they were announced, the Russian state news outlet Tass reported. “No, such information was not conveyed to us,” the presidential spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said.
Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, said he would summon the Russian ambassador to inform him of the lab results.

Steroids can be ‘lifesaver for Covid patients’," International clinical trials published on Wednesday confirm the hope that cheap, widely available steroid drugs can help seriously ill patients survive Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
Based on the new evidence, the World Health Organisation issued new treatment guidance, strongly recommending steroids to treat severely and critically ill patients, but not to those with mild disease.
“Clearly, now steroids are the standard of care,” said Dr Howard C. Bauchner, the editor-in-chief of JAMA, which published five papers about the treatment.
The new studies include an analysis that pooled data from seven randomised clinical trials evaluating three steroids in more than 1,700 patients. The study concluded that each of the three drugs reduced the risk of death.
JAMA published that paper and three related studies, along with an editorial describing the research as an “important step forward in the treatment of patients with Covid-19”.
Corticosteroids should now be the first-line treatment for critically ill patients, the authors said. The only other drug shown to be effective in seriously ill patients, and only modestly at that, is remdesivir. Steroids like dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone are often used by doctors to tamp down the body’s immune system.

‘Lucky’ Australia slips into recession," Australia’s economic engine has run without a major hitch for nearly three decades. Propped up by rich natural resources, fast-growing trade with Asia, a talented work force and vibrant immigration rates, the country even avoided stumbling during the 2008 global financial crisis.
But the nation sometimes known as “The Lucky Country” could not escape the ravages of Covid-19.
On Wednesday, Australia officially fell into recession — defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth — for the first time since 1991. Australian officials said the economy shrank 7 per cent during the three months that ended in June, a steeper fall than the prior quarter and its worst performance since the government began keeping records in 1959.
“Today’s devastating numbers confirm what every Australian knows: that Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on our economy and our lives like nothing we have ever experienced before,” Josh Frydenberg, the country’s treasurer, said on Wednesday.
The Australian economy will most likely bounce back after Covid-19 is tamed. Its performance has been stronger than those of other countries, like Britain, where output fell by a more dramatic 20 per cent in the most recent quarter.

Still, the new data marked a sobering, long-anticipated end to what had once seemed like an endless boom in a country where a generation or more of people have never experienced a slowdown.
“It was a real shock to the system,” said Jackson McRae, a 27-year-old musician in Melbourne who lost much of his livelihood when concerts were cancelled.
He has received government assistance and supplements his income by reading gas metres for a telecommunications firm.
The fact that unemployment could strike so quickly was “a wake-up call,” McRae said. “This can happen to us.”
Even after Covid-19 fades, Australia may have a harder time matching its past successes. China, its biggest trading partner, has seen its economic growth slow in recent years. Relations between the two countries are becoming increasingly tense. The Chinese ministry of commerce has imposed tariffs on Australian barley and could do so for Australian wines.
Australia faces other, longer-term economic problems. With climate change, disasters like catastrophic wildfires could become more frequent. Wage growth has been stagnant. A housing bubble in the country’s most populous cities, Sydney and Melbourne, led many people to take on big debt loads while preventing others from buying at all.
Economists said the downturn, brought on by the pandemic’s global impact as well as last season’s wildfires, could last at least a year, if not longer.
The Australian government has responded with over $150 billion in federal and state stimulus packages and $66 billion in lending support from the central bank.
“We have been shielded from what could have been worse,” said Andrew Grant, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney Business School. “But it might get worse before it gets better.”
Australia’s long boom has been part policy and part luck. Economists say the country’s careful monetary and fiscal policies have played a role, as has its political stability.

Trump silent on Kenosha police shooting,"  President Trump ventured into ground zero of the nation’s roiling debate over race and justice on Tuesday to stand in defence of the police and to reject calls for changes in law enforcement that have generated months of social unrest across the US.
Travelling to Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the objections of the governor and mayor who feared his presence would further inflame tensions, Trump offered support to law enforcement officers and toured shops damaged by rioting that followed last week’s shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was struck seven times in the back by a white police officer.
Trump never mentioned Blake’s name nor spoke with his family, brushing past the shooting and calling attention instead to the street violence that he blamed on liberal politicians.
He expressed more empathy for police officers, saying that they have a “tough job” and that occasionally some simply “choke” when put under “tremendous pressure” in carrying out their duties.
“It’s a dangerous job,” Trump told several law enforcement officials and Republican politicians at a high school in Kenosha. “But I have to say this to the police: The people of our country love you.”
Much of the small city shut down in anticipation of the President’s visit, with roads closed, commuter trains suspended, helicopters buzzing overhead and armoured cars deployed in the streets.
The calm was broken when woman in a pro-Trump hat and a man who said he was a member of the Proud Boys, a far-Right group known for inciting violence at protests, showed up at a park that has been a hub for rallies since Blake’s shooting.
As the police scrambled to separate the two from about 100 protesters shouting at them, an officer sprayed a chemical agent in the eyes of a documentary filmmaker.

Saudis open airspace to Israeli flights," Saudi Arabia announced Wednesday that it would allow any flights going to and from the UAE to fly over its territory, a move that would give Israel access to some of the kingdom’s airspace for the first time.
The announcement, made at the request of the UAE, came days after the first direct flight from Israel to the emirates — a symbolic move as the two nations begin normalising relations.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in a video statement delivered while standing in front of a map of the region, called the announcement a “tremendous breakthrough”.
“Flights will be cheaper and shorter, and it will lead to robust tourism and develop our economy,” Netanyahu said, while tracing the route between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi with his finger on the map. He also said the route would allow Israelis to save time and money when travelling east to Asia.
“These are the benefits of a peace that is genuine,” he said.

The flight from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi on Monday passed through Saudi airspace, the first time the kingdom had explicitly allowed an Israeli commercial jet to pass over its territory. Air India had earlier received approval to fly directly to Israel, and in 2018 established a direct route from New Delhi to Tel Aviv that passed over the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia’s decision to officially allow flights to and from Israel from the UAE makes the route more commercially viable, cutting a nearly seven-hour journey in half.
Monday’s flight was the latest sign of growing diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and the UAE that some hope will lead to similar moves in other Arab nations that have long refused to recognise the Jewish state. A landmark agreement came after six weeks of indirect talks between Israel and the emirates, with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, playing a central role.
The two nations announced the accord last month after decades of stalemate. The UAE is only the third Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel. Egypt signed a peace pact with the country in 1979, and Jordan signed a treaty in 1994.
Netanyahu thanked Kushner and Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, for the “important contribution” toward opening up the airspace, adding that there would “be a great deal more good news to come”.
The Saudi announcement in the country’s official press agency refers to allowing “all flights” to pass through its airspace.
The announcement appears to refer only to the commencement of commercial flights between Israel and the emirates, and said the decision was a response to a “request by the UAE”.
Saudi officials were quick to affirm that the change in rules in its airspace did not signal any departure from its current stance on the Israel-Palestinian issue.
“The kingdom’s positions regarding the Palestinian cause and people are fixed and firm,” Faisal bin Farhan, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said in a post on Twitter. He said that giving permission to “flights arriving in the UAE as well as those departing from it to all countries” to use the kingdom’s airspace did not change that.

Facebook threat to block sharing of Aussie news stories," With each passing day, the World Wide Web is becoming an outdated name.
Facebook warned on Monday that it would block users and news organisations in Australia from sharing local and international news stories on its social network and Instagram if the country passed a proposed code of conduct aimed at curbing the power of Facebook and Google.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the country’s top competition authority, is drafting a bill for parliament that would require both companies to negotiate with media publishers and pay them for content that appears on their sites.
Google also hinted that it might have to cut off its services in Australia in an open letter to users on August 17. Google said the government’s draft legislation would give large media companies “special treatment” so they could make unreasonable demands that would make it difficult to keep Google search and YouTube videos free.
Google, which owns YouTube, didn’t indicate how it would respond, but said its free services would be “at risk”.

The situation in Australia, while still playing out, demonstrates how government measures to diminish the influence of technology companies are creating digital fences between countries. While China has imposed restrictions on companies operating there for years, the US has shown a recent willingness to exercise exclusionary tactics on popular services from Chinese Internet companies.
The proposed changes in Australia could also contribute to the spread of disinformation, since news from legitimate news sources would be harder to find.
Over the past two months, the Trump administration has squared off against the Chinese government over the forced sale of ByteDance’s viral video app, TikTok, to an American technology company.
According to President Trump, ByteDance’s ties to the Chinese government are a national security risk to the US. The White House gave the Chinese company until September15 to divest its American assets or risk being shut down in the US.
Facebook said publishers and users in Australia trying to share news on its site would be greeted with a notification saying they were no longer able to do so and pointing to the legislation.
“The proposed law is unprecedented in its reach and seeks to regulate every aspect of how tech companies do business with news publishers,” said Will Easton, managing director of Facebook in Australia and New Zealand, in a company blog post on Monday eveningt.
Easton added that it would force Facebook to pay news organisations for content that the publishers voluntarily placed on its services.
In Australia on Tuesday, treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government’s efforts followed an 18-month-long inquiry by the country’s competition authority. “Australia makes laws that advance our national interest,” he said in comments to The Australian Associated Press. “We don’t respond to coercion or heavy-handed threats wherever they come from.”
The proposals, Frydenberg added, “will help to create a more sustainable media landscape and see payment for original content”.
Facebook signalled that it would continue to make investments in news despite the decision, including expanding its Facebook News tab — a paid partnership programme dedicated to showing curated news stories inside the mobile app — to more countries and paid partners.
The company is also building more support for outside subscriptions into the product, including an account-linking feature that allows subscribers to stay logged in to their news accounts while reading articles on Facebook.
By taking aim at Google, whose dominant search engine is the gateway for information and news, and Facebook, the largest social network with billions of users, Australia’s regulator seeks to address what it calls “power imbalances” between news publishers struggling with the collapse of traditional media and conglomerates with thriving online ad businesses.",world
Hong Kong begins mass tests for coronavirus amid doubts," Hong Kong tested thousands of people for coronavirus on Tuesday at the start of a mass-testing effort that’s become another political flash point in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
Volunteers stood in lines at some of the more than 100 testing centres, though many residents are distrustful over the resources and staff being provided by China’s central government and some have expressed fear DNA could be collected.
The Hong Kong government has dismissed such concerns, and leader Carrie Lam urged the public to see the programme in a fair and objective light and appealed to critics to stop discouraging people from being tested since participation was crucial to the programme’s success.
Priscilla Pun, a sales manager, got tested to give herself peace of mind. “I don’t see any reason not to do it, and this way I can let my family in Canada know that I am safe,” said Pun, who was tested at a centre in the eastern Quarry Bay neighbourhood.
Others, like Giselle Ming, said that she decided to take part to support the Hong Kong government’s initiative even though she was not worried that she might be a carrier of the coronavirus. “In this bad situation of the coronavirus, I hope I can do something to help the society,” she said.
Lam said at her weekly news conference that over 10,000 people, including most of Hong Kong’s government ministers, had been tested by Tuesday morning.
“This large-scale universal community testing programme is beneficial to fighting the epidemic and beneficial to our society.",world
"Trump can’t stop the violence, says Biden"," Joseph R. Biden Jr on Monday issued a forceful rebuttal to President Trump’s claim that the former vice- president would preside over a nation overwhelmed by disorder and lawlessness, asserting that it was Trump who had made the country unsafe through his erratic and incendiary governing style.
Biden condemned the violence that has occasionally erupted amid largely peaceful protests over racial injustice, and noted that the chaos was occurring on the President’s watch. He said Trump had made things worse by stoking division amid a national outcry over racism and police brutality.
“Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?” he said. “We need justice in America. We need safety in America. We’re facing multiple crises — crises that, under Donald Trump, have kept multiplying.”
Biden, the Democratic nominee for President, also pressed a broader argument that the President was endangering Americans with his response to the public health and economic challenges the country confronts.
The address was Biden’s most prominent effort yet to deflect the criticism that Trump and Republicans levelled against him at their convention last week, when they distorted his record on crime and policing. And in a fusillade of tweets over the last 48 hours the President suggested Biden was tolerant of “Anarchists, Thugs & Agitators”.
Speaking at the site of a converted steel mill in Pittsburgh with no audience, in a rare campaign appearance outside eastern Pennsylvania or his home state of Delaware, Biden rejected the suggestion that lawlessness would go unchecked under his leadership. “Ask yourself: Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters?” Biden, 77, said. “Really? I want a safe America. Safe from Covid, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. Let me be crystal clear: safe from four more years of Donald Trump.”",world
Wuhan’s kids back in school," The state-run news media said that more than 2,840 primary and secondary schools, serving nearly 1.4 million students, reopened on Tuesday. It was a striking turnabout from the early days, when the virus spread rapidly and mysteriously through Wuhan and officials imposed a 76-day lockdown.
Those memories lingered as students endured temperature checks outside school gates and lessons on hand-washing. But many hailed the school year as another sign that life was slowly getting back to normal in China.
“School is open, and I’m very excited and happy,” a sixth-grade student named Li Xinnuo told a radio broadcaster in Wuhan. “I can see my classmates, whom I haven’t seen for a long time.”
As countries around the world struggle to safely reopen schools, China is taking an ambitious approach, vowing to resume in-person classes this autumn for almost all students. (A notable exception is the region of Xinjiang in the west, where several cities remain under lockdown more than a month after an outbreak.)

Pakistan bans 5 dating apps for ‘immoral’ content," Pakistan’s telecom watchdog on Tuesday blocked five online dating and live streaming applications, including Tinder, for allegedly showing “immoral” content.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that the action was taken against Tinder, Tagged, Skout, Grindr and SayHi after they failed to take down the improper material.
It said that the apps were asked to remove “dating services” and moderate live streaming content “in accordance with the local laws of Pakistan” but they ignored the warning.
“Since the platforms did not respond to the notices within the stipulated time, therefore, the authority issued orders for blocking of the said applications,” the regulator said.
However, the PTA said it would reconsider blocking of the apps if their companies committed to follow the laws of the country and moderated the “indecent” content.

Samsung Group heir indicted," South Korean prosecutors indicted the Samsung Group’s Jay Y. Lee on Tuesday on suspicion of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation in connection with a 2015 merger, dealing a new blow to the head of one of Asia’s most valuable companies.
 Lee, who has already served jail time in connection with a separate case, and 10 other current and former Samsung executives were indicted over the merger of two Samsung affiliates that helped Lee assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.
 The indictment paves the way for Lee, 52, to undergo trial on the allegations. He will not be detained as a Seoul court denied a request in June for an arrest warrant.
 But the court said prosecutors seemed to have secured a considerable amount of evidence and it was appropriate to send the case to trial.
The decision comes as President Moon Jae-in rallies big business during a recession driven by the novel coronavirus, and at a time the public might be more interested in controlling the disease and reviving livelihoods than punishing the family-run conglomerates.

2 Saudi Arabia royals face anti-corruption probe," Saudi Arabia’s top military commander in its yearslong war in Yemen and his prince son have been removed from their posts along with other officials as part of an anti-corruption investigation, the kingdom said early on Tuesday.
The announcement attributed the actions to a referral by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A statement on the state-run Saudi Press Agency referred to “suspicious financial dealings monitored at the ministry of defence”.
Authorities also removed his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahad bin Turki, from his position as the deputy governor of Saudi Arabia's al-Jouf region in the kingdom's northwest.
The kingdom is investigating four other officials as well, all on the orders of 84-year-old King Salman, the statement said.

Hasina declares day of mourning for Kakababu," The Sheikh Hasina government on Monday announced a day of mourning on Wednesday in honour of former Indian President Pranab Mukherjee.
Mukherjee always had a special relationship with Bangladesh, specially Hasina, who used to address him as “Kakababu”. 
A condolence message released by the Prime Minister’s office in Dhaka said that Mukherjee’s death deeply saddened Hasina. “I always recall with profound respect his invaluable contributions to our Liberation War,” said Hasina in the message. 
She also said that Mukherjee always extended his cooperation to her family when they were in exile in India after the August 15, 1975, killing of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
According to Hasina, Mukherjee always enquired about the Sheikh family and stood beside them during hard times. Hasina said she also received Mukherjee’s cooperation and encouragement even after her return to Bangladesh. “He (Pranab Mukherjee) has been our guardian and family friend and he always provided strength to us during any crisis,” she said.
The Bangladesh Prime Minister said that in Mukherjee’s death Bangladesh had lost a dear friend. “He (Pranab Mukherjee) will remain alive as a glittering star in the politics of the subcontinent,” she said.

Portland clashes amplify US tensions," A fatal shooting in Portland, Oregon, over the weekend led President Trump to unleash a torrent of tweets and attacks on Sunday, capping a volatile week of street violence that is becoming a major theme in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign.
On Saturday, a man affiliated with a Right-wing group was shot and killed as a large caravan of supporters of Trump drove through downtown Portland, where nightly protests have unfolded for three consecutive months. No suspect has been publicly identified and the victim’s name has not been released.
The shooting came in the same week that a 17-year-old armed with a military-style weapon was charged with homicide in connection with shootings during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that left two people dead and one injured.
The pro-Trump rally in Portland drew hundreds of trucks filled with supporters and adorned with Trump flags into the city. At times, Trump supporters and counterprotesters clashed in the streets, with fistfights occurring and Trump supporters shooting paintball guns from the beds of pickup trucks as protesters threw objects at them.
Trump on Sunday morning posted or reposted a barrage of tweets about the clashes in Portland, with many of them assailing the city’s Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler. 
The President retweeted a video showing his supporters shooting paintballs and using pepper spray on crowds in Portland before the fatal shooting. Trump wrote that “the big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected”, a remarkable instance of a president seeming to support confrontation rather than calming a volatile situation.
The shooting immediately reverberated in a presidential campaign now entering its most intense period, and came on the heels of a Republican National Convention in which the president had sought to reframe the 2020 race as a “law and order” election.
Over the weekend, officials with Joseph R. Biden Jr’s campaign were inundated with concern and unsolicited advice from supporters and allies suggesting the need for a forceful and frontal response. Biden issued a statement on Sunday accusing Trump of “recklessly encouraging violence”, while condemning “violence unequivocally” himself.
“I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the Left or the Right,” Biden said. “And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.”
Biden will follow up with a speech in Pittsburgh on Monday, and discussions are underway for a possible trip to Kenosha soon. 
But the Biden campaign wants to avoid being drawn into a prolonged period of focus on unrest in the streets that campaign officials see as an effort by the Trump campaign to distract from the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, which has forced millions into unemployment.
At the same time, Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, on Sunday left open the potential of sending federal law enforcement to quell the unrest in Portland.
During an interview on ABC’s This Week, Wolf said “all options continue to be on the table” to deploy more federal agents to Portland despite the strong opposition of local leaders, who say such tactical teams have only heightened tensions. Wheeler, at an afternoon news conference at City Hall, said the shooting had left his heart heavy, and he denounced violence. 
But he pointed to Trump’s combative and unyielding message as a generator of the nation’s escalating polarisation and violence, and he called on the President to work with him and others to help de-escalate tensions.
“Do you seriously wonder, Mr President,” he said, “why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence? It’s you who have created the hate and the division.”
He added: “We need to reset. The President needs to reset. I need to reset. This community needs to reset. And America needs to reset. And it’s going to take his leadership in the White House and it’s going to take my leadership here in City Hall to get it done.”

Diplomat Mustapha Adib named as Lebanon’s new PM," Lebanese leaders named diplomat Mustapha Adib as the new prime minister on Monday under pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron who will visit Beirut to press for reforms aimed at dragging the West Asian nation out of a financial abyss.
With its economy devastated by a financial crisis, a swathe of Beirut in tatters following a huge port explosion on August 4 and sectarian tensions rising, Lebanon is facing the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
Adib, the former ambassador to Germany, was named hours before Macron was due in Beirut for his second visit in less than a month. Macron will push politicians to enact reforms that donors have demanded before they will release financial support.

3-year-old dragged by kite into the sky," A 3-year-old girl was swept high into the sky after a streamer became tangled around her neck during a kite-flying festival in northern Taiwan this weekend.
The child hovered above throngs of spectators and was zipped around by strong winds for a heart-stopping 30 seconds amid inflatable pandas and astronauts as screams erupted from spectators.
The girl, who was identified by news outlets only by her last name, Lin, landed mostly unscathed at the Hsinchu International Kite Festival. She suffered abrasions around her neck and face, the mayor of Hsinchu, Lin Chih-chien, wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. 
The startling episode drew an apology from the mayor, led to the suspension of festivities and added a frisson of horror to the event.
“The city government expresses its deepest apologies to the public and to the individuals involved, and we will review the reasons to avoid this type of accident from ever happening again, conducting a thorough review and holding people to account,” he wrote.

The kite festival in Taiwan, featuring larger-than-life designs from around the world, took place on a grassy expanse at a fishing port on the last weekend before kindergartens and other schools reopened for a new year. 
On Saturday, the Asia Kite Foundation, a Taiwan-based group that helped promote the kite-flying event, had urged families to take care on Sunday, when gales were forecast for the afternoon.
Sure enough, the winds were strong.
At 4pm, children gathered around for the unfurling of a “candy kite”, officially named “Joy Falls From Heaven”. A compartment attached to the long, voluminous orange fabric was filled with candy, and once it was sent into the air like a flying piñata, confection was supposed to rain down. 
Somehow, as a powerful draft lifted the ballooning kite from the grass, its tail lassoed the 3-year-old by the neck and hoisted her upwards. The pumpkin-orange kite suddenly became a parachute.
Dangling from the kite, the girl was whizzed across a sky full of floating cartoon figures and jerked around like a spool. Screams and shouts could be heard. When the winds shifted less than a minute later, the girl was spun rapidly in circles before people managed to pull the kite to the ground.

Kenosha India family suffer $2m loss," An Indian-origin family, who owned a car dealership in Kenosha, suffered a loss of over $2.5 million after their business was destroyed in a fire allegedly set by a mob during protests over the police shooting of a 29-year-old black man, the Kenosha News reported. 
It said that Anmol Khindri, a member of the family who owned the dealership “Car Source”, estimated the losses from the fire to be over $2.5 million. 
The owners are now “desperately seeking” help to recover their losses, the report said. 
Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a police officer on August 23 and remains in a hospital. The dealership was attacked when a mob descended into its lot and begin smashing cars on the first night of unrest last Sunday. There was an explosion and the subsequent fire spread from one vehicle to the next, one resident told Kenosha News. 
Khindri said police notified him of the damage, but he feels little was done to prevent it. “Everybody watched it burn to ashes,” he said. “Nobody did nothing about it — nothing.”

Khindri said he is at a complete loss as to what he should do next as insurance is not providing any immediate help. 
“I have a family to feed. I have 20 other families who have worked for this business over the last eight or nine years.” 
Khindri called for more protections for local businesses currently suffering from the impact of circumstances out of their control. 
“It’s easy for the government to say ‘alright, guys, you’re on your own. I’m sorry, your insurance doesn’t cover it. Oh, I’m sorry for your loss’. No, that’s not an answer. This happened because they let it happen.” A report in Fox News quoted Khindri as saying that the trauma of losing the business is “horrific”, adding that the insurance company has failed to provide immediate support and, as of last week, the destruction was labelled as “domestic terrorism”.
The Fox News report said that prior to the destruction, Car Source had more than 140 vehicles available for sale, according to its website.
Afterwards, a video showed the charred remains of dozens of cars — with only a few left unscathed. 
The report added that Josie Rodriguez, a resident of a house adjacent to Car Source, recalled seeing a mob descend into the lot and begin smashing cars. The business was allegedly attacked twice and the total loss is estimated at $2.5 million.
Charred scraps and shattered glass littered the area, where other downtown buildings had been badly damaged nights before. Rodriguez said it was a “terrifying time”.",world
Baltic states impose sanctions against Belarus," The three Baltic countries on Monday slapped their own travel sanctions on 30 top officials in Belarus, including President Alexander Lukashenko, in response to a brutal crackdown against protesters who say the Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus was rigged.
Those on the list are banned from entering Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, according to the document signed by the three Baltic nations' interior ministers.
New people will be added to the list in the future. said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.
The move comes as the European Union is planning its own sanctions list of up to 20 senior Belarus officials suspected of election fraud and the crackdown on protesters and is likely to put Lukashenko on that list at some point. All three Baltic nations are members of the EU.
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 26 years, has faced weeks of protests since he was re-elected to a sixth term on August 9 with what officials say was 80 per cent of the vote. The opposition says the poll was rigged, and both the EU and the U.S. say the election was neither free nor fair.
The Baltic travel ban list includes individuals from the president's office and administration, the central election commission, the Interior and Justice ministries and the general prosecutor's office, among others.
Last week, the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry proposed sanctions against 118 individuals suspected of involvement in brutal crackdowns on protesters demanding Lukashenko's resignation and 30 of them are suspected of vote-rigging in Belarus. The two other neighbouring Baltic countries were working on similar plans.",world
First 'historic' direct flight between Israel and UAE lands in Abu Dhabi," In a historic step towards peace in the Middle East, the first commercial direct flight between Israel and the UAE landed in Abu Dhabi on Monday after both countries announced normalisation of relations.

The flight carried a top level Israeli delegation led by National Security Adviser Meir Ben Shabbat while the US delegation was headed by US President Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.

The delegation left aboard the commercial El Al flight 971 that took off from Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv at 11.21am local time. The word peace was painted on it in Arabic, English and Hebrew above a cockpit window.

We just completed a truly historic flight. This hopefully will be the first of many, Kushner said after disembarking from the flight.

He thanked leadership on both sides on the occasion. Saudi Arabia granted permission for the use of its air space.

Peace overwhelmingly desired by the people, except by those who exploit misery to remain in power. Future belongs to industrious people of the region, Kushner said.

Israel and the UAE announced on August 13 that they were establishing full diplomatic relations, in a US-brokered deal that required Israel to suspend its plan to annex parts of the West Bank.

UAE is only the third Arab country to establish diplomatic ties with the Jewish state. Israel's neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, being the other two Arab states to recognise the Jewish state.

The development is being seen as a major breakthrough because the Israeli national carrier, El Al, flew over the Saudi airspace, which is being interpreted by analysts as acceptance of Israel by the Gulf countries in general, and a probable normalisation of ties with some of the other ""friendly countries"" in that region.

Kushner said that the message for Palestinians is full of hope and there is an economic and political plan ready that can revitalise their economy.

The region is very excited to move them forward but they cannot remain stuck in the past. Peace and opportunity will be ready for them as soon as they are ready to embrace them, he said.

Netanyahu during a press conference on Sunday said the breakthrough signalled the end of a ""Palestinian veto"".

I think for too long the Palestinians have had a veto on peace. Not only between Israel and the Palestinians but between Israel and the Arab world, the Israeli prime minister said.

If we have to wait for the Palestinians, we would have to wait forever. No longer. The Palestinians, when they realise that their veto has dissipated, will be hard pressed to remain outside the community of peace, he added.

Speaking alongside Kushner and O'Brien, Netanyahu expressed hopes that the normalisation of Israel-UAE ties will pave the way for treaties with more Arab countries.

Most of the Arab countries over the years have linked normalisation of ties with Israel to a peace agreement and just settlement of Israel-Palestinian conflict.

Palestinian leaders have condemned the UAE for agreeing to normalise relations with Israel, calling the move ""despicable and a betrayal"".

On asked about the possible sale of F-35 stealth jets to the UAE, Kushner said, ""Prime Minister Netanyahu and the president (Donald Trump) will discuss that at some point,"" the official WAM news agency reported.

The news agency Wam said the delegation also comprised of representatives from the investment, finance, health, civil space and aviation, foreign policy, diplomacy, tourism, and culture sectors.

The visiting delegates are scheduled to meet with representatives of UAE government agencies to discuss ways to develop relations in related fields and promote opportunities for cooperation.

This visit comes as part of trilateral efforts to initiate normalised relations with the aim of achieving peace, stability, and support for bilateral cooperation.

According to local reports, a return flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.

""Another step toward regional peace. We are all excited and look forward to more historic flights that will take us to other capital cities in the region, advancing us all to a more prosperous future,"" Tal Becker, the pilot of the plane, was quoted as saying in the report.

The special plane, El Al 737-900, is equipped with a system to protect aircraft against aerial threats like ground-to-air missiles, the report said.

The Directed IR Countermeasures (DIRCM) manufactured by Elbit Systems defend aircraft by detecting, tracking and jamming incoming infrared threats like heat-seeking ground-to-air missiles and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADs), it said.

Earlier in Israel before take off, Ben-Shabbat said Israel's goals for the trip is to ""reach a joint work plan to promote ties in a broad range of areas, including tourism, innovation, health and much more"".

Many believe that the normalisation of ties with UAE could have come only with Saudi blessings but Riyadh is yet to establish formal diplomatic ties with Jerusalem but is believed to covertly cooperate closely with the Jewish state.

Symbolic of direct connection between Israel and the UAE, the flight numbers have been marked LY971 on the way to Abu Dhabi and LY972 on the way back to Israel, using the telephone dialing code of the two countries.

"Qatar raises minimum wage, frees job shifters"," Qatar announced on Sunday changes to its labour laws, raising its minimum wage on Sunday by 25 per cent to 1,000 riyals (Rs 20,081) a month and scrapping a requirement for employees to get the permission of their employers to change jobs.
It is the latest in a series of labour reforms by the 2022 FIFA World Cup host, which in the lead up to the tournament has faced accusations that migrant workers are exploited.
The new minimum wage is non-discriminatory and applies to all workers, the labour ministry said in a statement.

Companies must also provide workers with accommodation and food or an additional combined monthly stipend of 800 riyals, it said. 
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) said Qatar was to become the first country in the region to adopt a non-discriminatory minimum wage. It also said, in addition to other reforms, removing the need for employees to obtain a no-objection certificate from their employers to change jobs “effectively dismantles” the “kafala” system.

"Doctors, problem is skin colour deep"," In the spring, teenagers started showing up at doctors’ offices in droves with angry red and purple blisters on their fingers and toes. The latest unexpected feature of the coronavirus infection fascinated the public, and suddenly photographs of so-called Covid toes were everywhere on social media.
But almost all of the images depicted glossy pink lesions on white skin. Though people of colour have been affected disproportionately by the pandemic, pictures of Covid toes on dark skin were curiously hard to find.
The problem isn’t unique to Covid toes or to social media. Dermatology, the medical specialty devoted to treating diseases of the skin, has a problem with brown and black skin. Though progress has been made in recent years, most textbooks that serve as road maps for diagnosing skin disorders often don’t include images of skin conditions as they appear on people of colour.
That’s a glaring omission that can lead to misdiagnoses and unnecessary suffering, because many key characteristics of skin disorders — like red patches and purple blotches — may appear differently on people with different complexions, experts say.
“Pattern recognition is central to dermatology, and a lot of the pattern recognition is training your eye to recognise certain colours that trigger you to think of certain diseases,” said Dr Jenna Lester, director of the skin of colour program at the University of California, San Francisco.
“But the colour in question is impacted by the surrounding colour,” she said. “It can look different in darker skin. If you’re only trained to look at something in one colour, you won’t recognise it in another colour.”
Dr Lester recently reviewed 130 images of coronavirus skin disorders published in medical journals and found they were overwhelmingly of white people.
As the coronavirus spread, dermatologists started an international registry to catalogue examples of skin manifestations of Covid-19. The registry compiled more than 700 images, but only 34 of disorders in Hispanic patients and 13 in Black patients were submitted.
It wasn’t until July that Dr Roxana Daneshjou and her colleagues at Stanford University published some of the first pictures of Covid toes in non-white patients in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
“We know for certain that if dark skin images are not well represented, skin doctors — but also other doctors who are not skin experts — are at a disadvantage for making a proper diagnosis,” said Dr Hao Feng, an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Connecticut.
Dr Feng reported recently that the omissions are still pervasive in textbooks, where only 10 per cent of images illustrate dermatologic diseases in dark skin. When pictures of Black patients were available, they most often described syphilis. He found that one digital resource, VisualDx, had a more diverse display of images: 28.5 per cent represented dark skin.
“If you have no experience with this in people of colour, it’s like saying you don’t know how to examine the lungs or the heart,” said Dr Art Papier, a dermatologist who co-founded VisualDX.
All doctors observe the skin for clues to disease. Changes in the skin can be the first indication of life-threatening conditions like sepsis, cellulitis or severe drug reactions to medications.
Images of skin cancer in dark skin were underrepresented in educational materials examined in Dr Feng’s study — yet skin cancer, though less common in people with darker skin, is more deadly in Black and Hispanic patients, and often diagnosed at a later stage.
The five-year survival rate is 66 per cent for non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with 90 per cent for non-Hispanic white patients.
Black patients are generally less likely than whites to see a dermatologist and less likely to undergo screening for skin cancer. Even when they do see a dermatologist, studies have shown, Black patients are less likely to get certain treatments than white people with the same conditions, like oral antibiotics for acne.
“I can tell you from my own clinical experience a lot of things get missed because people don’t recognise the disease process in darker skin,” Dr Feng said.
Even relatively common skin conditions can stump physicians if they have never seen them in people of colour.
When Dr Lester was in medical school, she recalled, a Black patient came to the clinic with a mysterious rash that had a purplish hue. “No one knew what it was,” Dr Lester said.
A biopsy revealed it was a common skin condition that doctors usually diagnose on sight, without tests or procedures: psoriasis. Yet it often goes unidentified and untreated in people of colour.
The medical literature describes psoriasis as “salmon pink patches with silvery white scales, but that’s not what it looks like in dark skin”, Dr Lester said. “It has more of a purple hue, and a lot of my Black patients put tons of moisturiser on when the skin is dry, so the scales aren’t as visible.”
Many garden-variety rashes will vary in appearance in different complexions. Eczema, which is typically described as making skin red and itchy, tends to be more bumpy in Black people, Dr Lester said. Pityriasis rosea is usually described as having a distinctive pattern composed of a large spot with smaller spots branching out from it — but it may not appear this way in people with dark skin.
Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, often develops in Black people in spots where doctors may not think to look for it: on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.
Doctors often miss rosacea in Black patients, too, because clinicians expect to see redness and visible blood vessels on the face, said Dr Amy McMichael, chair of the dermatology department at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
“You don’t see as much red if the background skin colour is brown,” she said.
Pallor, which can be an indication of anaemia as well as reduced blood flow and oxygen, will also have a different appearance in Black patients, said Dr Lynn McKinley-Grant, an associate professor at Howard University College of Medicine and president of the Skin of Colour Society, which promotes awareness and education about these variations.
“It’s a different colour, kind of a greyish colour,” she said. “I have actually thought of George Floyd. When he’s on the ground, his skin is a grey brown, showing lack of oxygen.” Kawasaki disease, a children’s disease that bears similarities to a Covid-19 complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, causes inflammation in blood vessels and presents with redness, but “how it appears in darker skin tone is very different,” said Dr Susan Taylor, associate professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
“You don’t want to miss that in a kid because you don’t know how to look for the rash and your eye isn’t trained to see it,” she said.
Dr Taylor is a co-author of Dermatology for Skin of Colour, one of the first textbooks that focused on the treatment of skin conditions in moderately to heavily pigmented skin. But new textbooks are not the solution, she said.
“We shouldn’t have to write separate textbooks — that information should be integrated into the quote-unquote standard textbooks,” Dr Taylor said.
Nearly half of dermatologists and dermatology residents in the US say they were not adequately trained to treat skin conditions in people of colour.
For Black patients, that often translates into a prolonged, disheartening search for the right diagnosis.
Many Black patients prefer to see Black dermatologists, who may be more familiar with and have a greater understanding of not only skin issues — like acne, which can leave dark, hyperpigmented spots on dark skin — but hair predicaments, said Dr Natalie Moulton-Levy, a dermatologist in Manhattan.
But getting in to see a dermatologist can be difficult, and waits are notoriously long. There is a shortage of dermatologists generally, and a shortage of dermatologists of colour in particular: Only 4 per cent of practising dermatologists identify as Hispanic, and only 3 per cent identify as Black or African-American, according to one study.
Black and Hispanic patients are far more likely than white patients to use the emergency room for dermatology problems, especially in rural areas and smaller cities where there are fewer dermatologists, studies have shown. People of colour are half as likely as white patients to see a dermatologist for the same conditions.
Physicians often say that they “do not see colour”, Dr Moulton-Levy said. “They are trying in a nice, benevolent way to say skin colour doesn’t matter.”
“But it absolutely matters, in dermatology and all of health care,” she said. “‘Colourblind’ is a very difficult term for me to hear.”

A more infectious coronavirus mutation," A more infectious mutation of the new coronavirus has been found in Indonesia, the Jakarta-based Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology said on Sunday, as the Southeast Asian country’s caseload surges.
Indonesia reported 2,858 new infections on Sunday, data by the health ministry showed, below the previous day’s record 3,308 but above the past month’s daily average. Its total number of cases was 172,053, with 7,343 Covid-19 fatalities.
The “infectious but milder” D614G mutation of the virus has been found in genome sequencing data from samples collected by the institute, deputy director Herawati Sudoyo told Reuters, adding that more study is required to determine whether that was behind the recent rise in cases.
The strain, which the World Health Organisation said was identified in February and has been circulating in Europe and the Americas, has also been found in neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia.
Syahrizal Syarif, an epidemiologist with the University of Indonesia, warned Indonesians must remain vigilant, as his modelling suggests the country may see its caseload rise to 500,000 by the end of the year.

“The situation is serious.... Local transmission currently is out of control,” Syarif said, adding that the number of infections found daily could have been much higher if laboratories were able to process more specimens in a day.
“There needs to be an awareness and a collective effort, be it from the government or the people, in addressing the rising number of cases,” Dwi Oktavia, an official at the Jakarta health agency, said in a statement. ",world

Consensus on new Lebanon Prime Minister," Lebanon’s ambassador to Germany Mustapha Adib looks set to be designated Prime Minister at formal consultations on Monday after winning political backing from the main Sunni Muslim party, the Future Movement.
Lebanon’s largest Christian bloc, the Free Patriotic Movement, will nominate Adib as the next Prime Minister, said party leader.
Lebanon’s Prime Minister must be a Sunni according to the country’s sectarian system. 
The government led by Hassan Diab quit earlier this month following the catastrophic explosion at Beirut port that killed some 190 people.
Lebanon is grappling with a financial meltdown that has devastated the economy and is seen as the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
The unprecedented economic crisis has already cost the Lebanese currency more than 80 per cent of its value, driving unemployment, poverty and inflation through the roof. 
Coronavirus infections and deaths have also spiked, causing concerns and pushing authorities to reintroduce some restrictions on economic and social activities that have largely been ignored amid the slump.
If the designation goes ahead without last minute complications, Adib will be nominated before a visit to Beirut on Monday by French President Emmanuel Macron, who is leading efforts to press Lebanese leaders to reform.
The Future Movement, led by former Premier Saad al-Hariri, announced its support for Adib after a meeting of its parliamentary bloc on Sunday.
The Iran-backed Shia party Hezbollah and its Shia ally the Amal Movement will also nominate Adib in the consultations, a senior Shia source told Reuters.
President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian allied with Hezbollah, is required to designate the candidate with the greatest level of support among MPs at Monday’s consultations.
Once designated, the process of forming a new government will get underway. Until a new administration is agreed, the Diab government continues in a caretaker capacity. ",world
"Vodafone wins Rs 22,100 cr retro tax case against India"," British telecom giant Vodafone Group plc on Friday won an arbitration against the Indian government over a demand for Rs 22,100 crore in taxes using retrospective legislation.
An international arbitration tribunal ruled that India's demand in past taxes were in breach of fair treatment under a bilateral investment protection pact.
""The award is confidential but Vodafone can confirm that the tribunal has found (it) in Vodafone's favour,"" Vodafone Group said in a statement. ""We are studying the lengthy documents and can make no further comment at this time.""

It was not immediately known if the Indian government will abide by the arbitration award.
The Government of India's liability will be restricted to about Rs 75 crore -- Rs 30 crore in cost and another Rs 45 crore in tax refund, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Vodafone had before the arbitration tribunal challenged India's usage of a 2012 legislation that gave it powers to retrospectively tax deals like Vodafone's USD 11 billion acquisition of 67 per cent stake in the mobile phone business owned by Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.
It challenged the demand of Rs 7,990 crore in capital gains taxes (Rs 22,100 crore after including interest and penalty) under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).
Sources said the tax demand was on the UK-listed company and Vodafone's India venture faced no liability.
Vodafone merged its India operations with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla's conglomerate but the combined entity Vodafone Idea Ltd is facing a USD 7.8 billion bill in past statutory dues.
Tax authorities had in September 2007 served notice to Vodafone International Holdings BV (VIHBV) for its alleged failure to deduct withholding tax from consideration paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd.
Vodafone challenged this in the Supreme Court, which in January 2012 set it aside, saying the transaction was not taxable in India and so the company had no obligation to withhold tax.
In May that year, Parliament passed the Finance Act 2012 that amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 with retrospective effect to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets.
The company was in January 2013 served a tax notice of Rs 14,200 crore after including interest on the principal amount. A year later, Vodafone challenged the tax demand under the Dutch BIT.
Sources said the company in April 2014 served the notice of arbitration after out-of-court dispute resolution talks failed.
The tax department in February 2016 served a demand notice of Rs 22,100 crore, including interest accruing since the date of the original demand.
Vodafone has always maintained that there is no liability and that it will ""continue to defend vigorously any allegation that VIHBV or Vodafone India Ltd is liable to pay tax in connection with the transaction with Hutchison and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress"".
Besides Vodafone, the Indian government also used the retrospective tax legislation to seek Rs 10,247 crore from British oil explorer Cairn Energy Plc over a 2006 reorganisation of its Indian businesses.",business
ED notice to attach Rs 127 cr London flat of Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor," The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a Rs 127-crore flat of Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor in London in connection with a money laundering investigation against him and others, the central agency said on Friday.
The agency issued a provisional order for attaching the property -- Apartment 1, 77 South Audley Street, London -- under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
""The market value of the flat is 13.5 million pound (about Rs 127 crore). The property was purchased by Rana Kapoor in 2017 for 9.9 million pound (Rs 93 crore) in the name of DOIT Creations Jersey Limited and he is the beneficial owner,"" the ED said in a statement.
It claimed that the agency had obtained ""information from a reliable source that Kapoor was trying to alienate this property in London and that he has hired a reputed property consultant.""
""Enquiries from open sources confirmed that this property has been listed for sale on several websites,"" it said.
The agency, as per procedure, will now approach their counterparts in the United Kingdom to execute the attachment order and will issue a proclamation that the asset cannot be sold or purchased as it has been seized under the criminal sections of the PMLA.
The ED has earlier attached assets in the US, Dubai and Australia in a similar fashion as part of other investigations under the PMLA.
The ED had booked Kapoor, his family members and others under the PMLA after studying a CBI FIR that alleged that dubious multi-crore loans were given by Yes Bank to various entities in contravention of the law and in lieu of purported kickbacks given to the Kapoor family.
The CBI FIR had stated that during April-June, 2018, Yes Bank Limited had invested Rs 3,700 crore in the short term debentures of DHFL.
""Simultaneously, Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL paid kickback of Rs 600 crore to Rana Kapoor and his family members in the garb of loan of Rs 600 crore (given by DHFL) to DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd (Rana Kapoor group company).""
""In addition to the above, Yes Bank Ltd had also sanctioned a loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers, a group company of DHFL beneficially owned by Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and their family members,"" the ED alleged.
This loan of Rs 750 crore had been sanctioned to them for their Bandra Reclamation Project, Mumbai, but the entire amount was siphoned off by Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan through their shell companies, it said.
Rana Kapoor, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan have been arrested by the ED in this case and they are in judicial custody at present.
The agency had also filed charge sheets before a special court in Mumbai in this case.
The ED had earlier attached properties in this case and with this order, the total attachment in this probe stands at Rs 2,011 crore.",business

Ministry allows airlines to decide domestic baggage limits," The aviation ministry has allowed airlines to decide on baggage limitations for domestic passengers — an indication that the sector may resume normal flight schedules soon.
Passengers were so far allowed only one check-in bag on domestic flights since May 25.
Before domestic flights were suspended on March 25, Air India would allow check-in luggage of up to 25 kg and private airlines — with some limiting the number of bags — up to 15 kg for economy flyers.
“The matter has been reviewed based on inputs received from stakeholders. Considering the convenience of passengers, it has been decided to (allow)… baggage limitation according to airlines’ policies,” said an order issued by Usha Padhee, joint secretary in the aviation ministry.
Air India says it will now allow domestic passengers in economy and business class to check-in up to 25 kg and 35 kg, respectively.
Air India Express says it “permits 25 kg as checked-in (on domestic flights) and 7 kg as hand bags which continues”. Vistara said it will be “restoring the pre-Covid baggage allowance from Monday (September 28)… in response to the latest advisory issued by the government.”

Harley-Davidson to discontinue sales and manufacturing ops in India," Harley-Davidson Inc said on Thursday it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India, effectively abandoning the world’s biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold.
The move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, some 70 redundancies and the closure of its Bawal plant, walking away from a market worth about 17 million bike and scooter sales a year. It will retain only a scaled-down sales office in Gurgaon.
“As part of The Rewire, an overhaul of its operating model and market structure, the company is changing its business model in India and evaluating options to continue to serve its customers,” a press release said.
The Harley-Davidson dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term. “The present contract term is till December,” said Adarsh Tulsyan, proprietor of the sole Harley Davidson dealership in Calcutta. 
The company has a total of 33 dealerships in the country. Tulsyan said he sold 100 motorbikes in a year on an average. “We are naturally disappointed. With the closure of the factory, the possibility of having new bikes is low. The news is yet to sink in. However, servicing of bikes continues.”

Borrowing road map for fiscal second half on Monday," The government is expected to come up with a borrowing road map for the second half of the fiscal on Monday amid a raging debate whether it would raise Rs 4.34 lakh crore as planned or a higher sum to foot the burgeoning pandemic bill as tax collections moderate.
Some analysts said the government would wait till the third quarter was over when it would be better able to assess its revenue post the festive season.
Hard-pressed for funds to combat the rising coronavirus infections, the government in May increased its market borrowing for the current financial year by more than 50 per cent to Rs 12 lakh crore. In February, the budget had set a target to borrow Rs 7.80 lakh crore.
Aditi Nayar, principal economist, Icra said: “The government’s net tax revenues, non-tax revenues and disinvestment proceeds will together trail the FY2021 budget estimate by a huge Rs 6 lakh crore.”
“Moreover, expenditure will rise on account of the fiscal support announced under the ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, and the cash outgo for other items included in the First Supplementary Demand for Grants.”

She said the  fiscal deficit would widen to at least Rs 14 lakh crore this fiscal from the budgeted Rs 8 lakh crore. Accordingly, this entails a further expansion in the GoI’s borrowing calendar for the second half of at least Rs 1.1 lakh crore.  Borrowing plan: Rs 4.34 lakh cr
Why it may be inadequate: Sharp drop in revenue collections. One estimate puts additional borrowing of Rs 1.1 lakh crore
What can govt do: Can wait till third-quarter ends. Better assessment of revenues after festive season However, Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings, said: “It is unlikely to be more than Rs 12 lakh crore for the full year….therefore no surprise is expected.”
“The government would wait and watch the situation and take a call at the end of the third quarter of the current fiscal. The Covid-19 pandemic has created uncertainty on the demand spur in the coming months and the government would be cautious to watch out and take a call,” Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist in India Ratings & Research, said.

Though the RBI is likely to maintain its accommodative stance and use unconventional tools to kickstart the economy such as targeted long-term repo, an interest rate cut is being ruled out at its forthcoming meeting given the elevated retail inflation.
Market circles said it was the negative global cues that led to stocks opening in the red and remaining under pressure through the session. There were apprehensions about global economic growth as the UK is set to go into a second lockdown and travel restrictions return in several countries in Europe.
Further, there were  mounting concerns over the recovery in the US with the weekly jobless showing a surprising rise on Thursday. There were more fears as the US Federal Reserve indicated it would not increase the size of its asset purchases amid fears that investors were poised to dump junk bonds.
“Investors have largely given up on the idea the US Congress will provide a new stimulus, while worrying about a recent rise in Covid-19 cases. Economists at Goldman Sachs cut their US growth forecast for the fourth quarter by half, to 3 per cent from 6 per cent,” said Deepak Jasani head of retail research, HDFC Securities.

Tatas mull options to buy Mistry stake," Bombay House wore a cloak of silence a day after the Shapoorji Pallonji camp squarely put the ball in the Tata court by announcing its desire to sever a 70-year-old relationship with the $113 billion conglomerate.
The Mistry camp owns an 18.37 per cent stake in Tata Sons, the group’s holding company, and intends to press for a high valuation of Rs 1.78 lakh crore for the sale of its shares.
The ballpark valuation figure has left everyone a little bemused by the options that lie before the Tatas as they look to squeeze the Mistry family out of their lair.
ADVERTISING

The funding options for the Tatas are complicated by the restrictions in the Companies Act 2013 that bar cash-rich operating companies in the Tata fold such as TCS from stumping up a part of the funds to help Tata Sons buy out the Mistry stake.
The Tata Trusts are equally hemmed in by regulations: they cannot purchase the shares as the law does not permit such transactions by charitable trusts.
The first step for the Tatas will be to appoint a valuer for Tata Sons’ equity capital. The SP Group may be eyeing a valuation of Rs 1.78 lakh crore that takes into account the direct and indirect assets that Tata Sons controls and the valuation of the Tata brand itself that brings a stream of revenue from the operating companies in the form of royalty.
Back in 2016, chartered accountant Y.H. Malegam had valued Tata Sons at around Rs 58,000 crore. 
The first step is to narrow the wide gap between the two numbers and see if the two sides can agree.
The Tata group’s holding company will find it hard to rustle up a large sum of money as it comes under increasing pressure to funnel cash into the many operating businesses that are grappling with an alarming drop in demand for their products in a post-Covid environment. But Tata Sons has some options that they can still explore. The first would be to rope in a strategic investor whose vision is in sync with their own. It can also sell a part of the stake in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Tata Sons holds a little over 72 per cent in TCS and, at the current market prices, the IT giant is valued at Rs 6.67 lakh crore. But it would then would have to live with a lower income stream from TCS in the future in the form of dividends.
According to a note from the proxy advisory firm IiAS, Tata Sons will need to sell a roughly 16 per cent stake in TCS if it wants to buy out the SP Group by relying on its own resources. But this would bring down its stake in the country’s leading technology company to 56 per cent, which will still give it control but could bring in investors who may wish to drive their own corporate governance agenda.
“This will mean that the Tata Group will continue to control TCS, but its cash flows from the company will be lower than before. For the past several years, and even now, Tata Sons’ ability to infuse equity and provide liquidity support to its businesses has been driven by TCS’s dividends and buyback. The sale of 16 per cent of TCS will restrict Tata Sons’ financial flexibility and somewhat weaken its ability to hold the group together,” the proxy advisory firm cautioned.
The next option is to induct strategic partners or other investors like private equity and sovereign wealth funds into Tata Sons. But they might baulk at the status of Tata Sons being a private company. These investors may insist that Tata Sons reverts to its earlier status as a public company. It remains to be seen if the Tatas will agree to such a demand should it be raised.
Tata Sons has the option of going in for a buyback. However, the consequent reduction in share capital may affect its ability to raise debt in the future.
Meanwhile, shares of SP Group companies rallied on the bourses on Wednesday.

"Mistry gives up, to sell out to Tatas"," The Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group has finally thrown in the towel after a bruising, four-year battle with Ratan Tata and the executors of the trusts of the $113-billion salt-to-software conglomerate.
“Today, it is with a heavy heart that the Mistry family believes that a separation of interests would best serve all stakeholder groups,” the Cyrus Mistry camp said in a media release just hours after the Supreme Court ordered status quo on the shares in Tata Sons that the SP Group had intended to pledge with a Canadian investor to raise badly needed funds for the cash-strapped construction and real estate group.
The battle between the two partners had erupted in October 2016 when the Tata Group summarily removed Mistry as its chairman, angered over the manner in which he was running its affairs at Bombay House, the headquarters of the Tata Group.

On September 5, the Tatas had filed a petition before the Supreme Court to stymie a funding agreement between the SP Group and Brookfield — a marquee Canadian investment firm — to raise a first tranche of Rs 3,750 crore.
The real estate and construction group had been planning to raise Rs 11,000 crore that it desperately needed to tide over an acute funds crunch precipitated by the pandemic.
The Mistry camp informed the apex court at a brief videoconference hearing in the morning that a “separation from the Tata Group is necessary due to the potential impact this continuing litigation could have on the livelihoods and the economy”.
Counsel for the SP Group had informed the court that “it was crucial that an early resolution is reached to arrive at a fair and suitable solution reflecting the value of the underlying tangible and intangible assets (of Tata Sons)”, the release from the Mistry camp said.
“The past oppressive actions, and the latest vindictive move by Tata Sons that impact the livelihoods of the wider SP Group community leads to the inescapable conclusion that the mutual co-existence of both groups at Tata Sons would be infeasible,” the letter issued by the Mistry camp said.
The Tatas refused to comment on the sudden turn of events.
Until the late evening letter, it wasn’t clear after the Supreme Court hearing that the Mistrys were planning to take such a precipitate step and sever their ties with the Tatas.
Earlier in the day, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde had ordered the parties to “maintain status quo regarding the transfer and pledging of shares already made” while posting the case for hearing on October 28.
At the hearing, counsel for the two sides sparred over the Mistry camp’s fund-raising plan. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the Tatas, accused the SP Group of playing “mischief” by pledging the shares with a foreign company and not offering it to the Tatas who, he claimed, held the right of first refusal.
Senior advocate C.A. Sundaram, appearing for the Mistry camp, countered the allegation and said the Tata Group’s action was “causing havoc” and “throttling” the Pallonji group from pledging its shares.
The Mistry camp will of course try to extract the best possible value for the shares that the group assiduously built up within the Tata Group from the mid-sixties.
An estimate floating around in Mumbai put the value of the Tata Sons equity shares at Rs 9,70,029 crore with each share valued at Rs 2.40 crore. This would place the value of the Mistry camp’s 18.37 per cent stake at Rs 1,78,459 crore.
The estimate includes the value of Tata Sons’ stakes in various listed and unlisted companies of the group. It also includes the “intangible” value of the Tata brand which has been estimated at Rs 1,46,000 crore. Ratan Tata had pioneered a system in the mid-nineties under which group companies had to pay royalties to the holding company for the use of the Tata brand name.
There are tough negotiations that lie ahead between the two partners turned foes. The Tatas are expected to try to beat down the valuation and the ultimate payout.
The Mistry camp did not spell out how the process of separation would be achieved but it is likely to be a court-driven process, which could be initiated at the next hearing of the Supreme Court.
Tata Sons had turned into a private limited company in September 2017 and changed its articles of association that empower it to exercise a right of first refusal on any share that an investor plans to sell in the group’s holding company.
Tata Sons, which has only 23 equity shareholders, had all but effectively shut down the Mistry camp’s options. However, in December last year, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had ordered the reinstatement of Mistry as chairman of the group and declared the decision of the registrar of companies (RoC) to change Tata Sons’ status from a public company to a private company as “illegal” and set it aside.
That verdict sparked another legal battle — this time before the Supreme Court.
The SP Group has clearly tired of the costly litigation battle.
On Tuesday, the group tried to set the record straight both on the events that have unfolded over the past four years and the honourable manner in which it had upheld its fiduciary responsibility as a minority shareholder of Tata Sons.
“The SP Group had always used its voting rights as a shareholder for the best interest of the Tata Group. It is a matter of record that prior to the year 2000, when the Tata Trusts, being public charitable trusts, couldn’t exercise their voting rights, the same being held by a public trustee, the SP Group voted to protect the best interests of the Tata Group,” the Mistry camp’s release said.
The letter recalled that Cyrus Mistry had accepted the position of chairman of Tata Sons in 2012 — when Ratan Tata decided to retire — “with a sense of duty as an ‘insider’ on the Board of Tata Sons”.
Mistry said that he had attempted to establish a governance structure for the Tata Group — which eventually resulted in the feud with Ratan Tata — only because “several leaders who were retiring from the Board of Tata Sons also served as Trustees of the majority shareholders — the Tata Trusts”.
The letter said Mistry was removed when he attempted to implement these “governance reforms” and undo the financial damage caused to the group because of certain “value destructive business decisions” taken in the past. As a result, the total debt of the major Tata Group companies had ballooned to approximately Rs 100,000 crore in the last three years.
The Mistry camp said it decided to sever ties after being blocked by Tata Sons from raising funds from the pledge of the shares they held.
The fund-raising plan was designed, it said, “to protect the livelihoods of 60,000 employees and over 100,000 migrant workers” of the 150-year-old SP Group.",business
US partner for real estate consultant Anarock," Real estate consultant Anarock on Tuesday said it has partnered US-based Binswanger to offer advisory, brokerage and transaction services in the industrial and logistics parks segment.
The two partners — Binswanger Commercial Real Estate Services and Anarock — will offer these services on industrial real estate opportunities between India, the US and other global markets, Anarock said in a statement.

Mistry camp looking at big valuations," The Shapoorji Pallonji camp is looking at a huge payout for the 18.37 per cent stake it holds in Tata Sons, the holding company of the $113-billion Tata group.
An unofficial estimate floating around in corporate circles put the value of the Mistry camp’s holding of 74,352 Tata Sons’ shares at Rs 1,78,459 crore — which would arguably suggest the biggest-ever payout to any shareholder in India Inc even though both sides will almost certainly quibble over the sum.
In a statement put out late on Tuesday evening, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group (SP Group) said it was looking for a “fair and equitable solution reflecting the value of the underlying tangible and intangible assets”of the group.
Tata Sons has a 72.02 per cent stake in technology major TCS — the most profitable company in the group — which reported a total income of Rs 1.39 lakh crore in the year ended March 31 and earned a net profit of Rs 33,260 crore.
The holding company also has a 32.93 per cent stake in Tata Steel, 38.97 per cent in Tata Motors and 28.51 per cent in Tata Chemicals — the other frontline companies in the group which comprises over 80 operating companies.

A spokesperson for the SP Group refused to comment on the valuation of their equity holding in Tata Sons. Sources, however, said the Rs 1.75 lakh crore valuation had been derived from the value of the stakes held by Tata Sons in the listed and unlisted companies of the group and the value of the Tata brand.
In the mid-nineties, Ratan Tata had ordered Tata group companies to pay a royalty for the use of the Tata brand name, setting a trend among several companies to extract a stream of revenue from operating companies in the group in addition to dividend income.
Tata Sons currently holds a stake in 14 listed companies. Based on the closing price of TCS on the BSE on Tuesday, the value of the over 72 per cent stake held by Tata Sons comes close to Rs 6.82 lakh crore.
Tata Sons also holds a stake in Titan, Voltas and Tata Consumer Products. Taken together, the market value of Tata Sons’ holdings in the group’s listed companies works out to over Rs 7.79 lakh crore.
It also has a stake in several unlisted entities, including Ewart Investments, Panatone Finvest, Tata Capital, Tata International and Infinity Retail. The value of these investments is being assessed at Rs 25,000-50,000 crore.
The Mistry family may also be looking at the Tata brand value. In June, Brand Finance, which values 5,000 of the world’s biggest brands, said the Tata group had retained its title as India’s most valuable brand.
It said the value of the Tata brand had risen by a modest 2 per cent to $20 billion (or Rs 1.47 lakh crore) — the first time that any Indian brand has surpassed this threshold. It added that the Tata Group was the only Indian brand to feature in the top 100 of the Brand Finance Global 500.
If the value of all the listed and unlisted companies is taken along with the valuation of the Tata brand, it would soar to over Rs 9.50 lakh crore.
Based on the 18.37 per cent holding of the Mistry family, this could imply a value of over Rs 1.75 lakh crore for their holding in Tata Sons. However, these are only estimates and the actual payout may be less.
While the key question is whether both the group will arrive at a valuation that is acceptable to them, it also remains to be seen if the Tatas can raise Rs 1 lakh crore to buy out the Mistry camp which also holds 20,000 preference shares of Tata Sons.
Automobiles, steel, hospitality, consumer goods — areas in which the Tatas have a big investment — have been rocked by the pandemic.",business
Sebi shield for debt mutual funds," The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is initiating a series of measures to address the challenges faced by debt mutual funds, particularly the lack of liquidity in non-AAA bonds.
Apart from a “backstop facility” for such schemes, the market regulator will be setting up a working group to address the problem of liquidity risk management for open-ended debt-oriented schemes, Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Tuesday while addressing the 25th annual general meeting of the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).
Tyagi said Sebi has taken several measures such as mandating fund houses to hold 20 per cent of their assets under management (AUM) in liquid assets like cash, government securities and treasury bills, and directing them to invest primarily in listed debt securities (including commercial paper).

However, debt mutual funds have faced the challenge of significant risk aversion and the bond market was hit by illiquidity, especially in AA and below rated papers, resulting in redemption pressures. “That experience brought to the fore not only the structural issues related to the corporate bond markets but also revealed some areas of improvement in respect of the practices followed in the mutual fund industry,” Tyagi said.
His comments must be seen in the context of the recent statement made by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his address to the Ficci national executive committee where he said that benign financing conditions and the substantial narrowing of spreads have spurred a record issuance of corporate bonds of close to Rs 3.2 lakh crore during 2020-21 up to August.

Tyagi said Sebi was considering a backstop facility, a mechanism almost similar to a bad bank wherein the latter acquires the stressed assets of banks. However, in this case, it will be an entity that will buy the illiquid corporate bonds from mutual funds.
The expert committee will frame a stress testing methodology, encompassing liquidity, credit and market risks for all open-ended debt-oriented mutual fund schemes. The panel will also design a framework to determine the minimum asset allocation required in liquid assets. According to Tyagi, another issue that needs to be examined is the impact of large redemptions on the remaining unit holders of a scheme.
For schemes witnessing large redemption requests, there are high chances that the more liquid assets get liquidated first and the scheme is then left with a relatively more illiquid portfolio. This benefits exiting investors at the cost of those who continue to stay. Here, the proposed committee will examine liquidity risk management tools such as anti-dilution levy for passing on transaction costs to the transacting investors.
On the recent circular on multi-cap funds, Tyagi said the market regulator was not forcing anyone to invest in small-caps and the investment should always be in the interest of investors amid new portfolio allocation rules for multi-cap mutual fund schemes.
On the recent circular relating to multi-cap funds, he disclosed that a representation has been made by AMFI which is being examined by SEBI and a decision will be announced soon. It may be recalled that Sebi had made it mandatory for multi-cap funds to play true to their label and invest a maximum of 25 per cent in each of the fund categories: large cap, mid-cap, and small cap. Here he said that the market regulator is not forcing mutual funds to invest in small and mid cap funds, but they must not mis-label and mis-sell mutual fund products.",business
PMC Bank gets new administrator," The RBI has appointed A.K. Dixit, former general manager of Union Bank of India, as the new administrator of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank) with effect from Wednesday. He will replace J.B. Bhoria, who is stepping down because of health reasons.
The Parliament on Tuesday passed amendments to the Banking Regulation Act to bring co-operative banks under the supervision of the RBI, a move aimed at protecting the interest of depositors.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government was able to quickly resolve the crisis at Yes Bank as it was governed by commercial bank rules, but a solution for the PMC Bank crisis is yet to be found.
PMC Bank, which is among the top 10 urban co-operative banks, was placed under an RBI administrator because of massive under-reporting of dud loans.
The RBI said in a statement that while the administrator of PMC Bank and the central bank have been exploring various options for resolution, several factors such as huge losses incurred by the bank and a steep erosion in deposits pose serious challenges in finding a workable plan for revival of the bank.
“The bank has also been making efforts to recover bad loans  although the progress has been constrained because of the Covid-19 pandemic and legal complexities. Nevertheless, in the interest of the depositors, the PMC Bank and the RBI are working with stakeholders to find a viable solution,’’ the RBI said.",business
Finance ministry to suspend spending forecasts," The government will not make expenditure forecasts for the next two financial years — 2021-22 and 2022-23 — because of “unreliable growth estimates” on account of the  Covid-19 pandemic, according to a finance ministry report.
The ministry will not make a full disclosure in its medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) statement that will be presented in the current session because of unreliable growth estimates. The statement is a mandatory requirement under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.
The MTEF forecasts government expenditure based on GDP, fiscal deficit and gross tax revenue projections.
“The MTEF statements provide rolling targets of prescribed expenditure indicators for the next two financial years — 2021-22 and 2022-23. These projections are usually derived by providing a normative increase over the anticipated expenditure of the current year, subject to other factors. This year, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the base line expenditure estimates may be artificially inflated,” the finance ministry said in a report.
“It may be difficult to tease out the transient components of the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Package and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan Package,” the report said. Hence, expenditure estimates may be unreasonably high providing an inaccurate fiscal plan, “and a faulty foundation for the upcoming budgets”, it said.

The report also said the accepted recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission to transfer tax receipts to states and grants to local bodies are applicable till March 31, 2021. The share of taxes for financial years 2021 to 2026 will be based on the final report to be submitted in October-end.
On the fiscal deficit target for 2019-20 being recalibrated to 3.8 per cent of GDP compared with the budgeted target of 3.3 per cent of GDP, the report said the deviation was necessary on account of the structural reforms, both on the supply and the demand side, carried out by the government. Parliament on Tuesday passed amendments to the Banking Regulation Act to bring co-operative banks under the supervision of the RBI, a move aimed at protecting the interest of depositors. The bill replaces an ordinance that was promulgated on June 26.",business
Onion exports to Bangladesh to resume," The government is working on resuming onion supplies to Bangladesh with certain conditions within days of imposing a ban. The move follows diplomatic intervention which resulted in the consignment in transit to be exported.
Senior commerce ministry officials said the ministry was considering imposing a minimum export price and also allowing certain varieties of onion such as Bangalore rose and Krishnapuram, that have insignificant domestic demand.
They said the issue was being discussed at the highest level so that the relaxation in export does not result in a spike in domestic prices.
Sources said the government plans to move cautiously on this issue, especially at a time the country is witnessing growing peasant unrest over the farm bill, and this can add fuel to farmers’ ire. Sources said the government would be keen to allow exports to neighbouring countries given the border tension so that the immediate markets in the neighbourhood are not captured by Pakistan and China.
India is the biggest exporter of onions to Bangladesh, Nepal, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. However, traders in Bangladesh have been tapping various countries to import onion.
According to the information provided by Chittagong Plant Quarantine Station (Sea Port), as many as 274 import permits were issued for 118,727 tonnes of onion between September 3 and September 21, the Dhaka Tribune said.
These permits indicate that 17,365 tonnes of onion will come from China apart from shipments from Pakistan, Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey, the Netherlands, Malaysia and New Zealand.",business
Reliance Jio starts price war," After unleashing a price war in mobile tariffs and fibre-broadband services, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio on Tuesday unveiled postpaid plans, bundling up to 500GB of data and subscription to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ Hotstar.
JioPostPaid Plus for mobile customers will have a monthly tariff of Rs 399 to Rs 1,499 with different benefits, the company said in a statement.
The move assumes significance as it marks a major tariff offensive by Jio in the post-paid category, where typically average revenue per user tends to be far higher than the pre-paid segment.
Jio is also offering free home delivery, activation and premium call centre service.           
“There can’t be a more opportune time to introduce JioPostpaid Plus,” said director Akash Ambani.

Donald Trump plays H1B staff wage card," The US government is planning to raise the minimum wage for foreign workers under the H-1B visa programme ahead of the presidential elections in November. The move could act as an impediment to on-shoring contracts and may push technology companies to consider hiring more local employees.
According to Reuters, the White House budget office is reviewing a regulation that would raise the wages that employers must pay to H-1B visa holders. The move is aimed at bringing parity in a programme that otherwise permits US employers to underpay H-1B workers compared to US workers.
At present, H-1B employees are hired at four levels (entry, qualified, experienced, fully competent or supervisory) based on their education and experience. The US labour department determines the wages based on prevailing rates for specific employee roles in different regions of the country.
However, market observers and legal experts said increasing the minimum wages could make it difficult for businesses, especially in the IT sector, to meet the minimum wage threshold, effectively deterring companies from hiring workers on the H-1B visa.
US president Donald Trump faces re-election on November 3 and has made immigration a focus area of his campaign against Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

Nandini P. Nair, partner at US law firm Greenspoon Marder LLP, said: “The Trump administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda to revamp the H-1B programme ahead of the elections. If the rumour is correct that they will most likely force employers to pay a Level 3 Wage, most companies will not be able meet that threshold, especially small, mid-size and startup companies. The impact would be great and could force business to shut down or off shore the work outside the US.”
“The proposal to hike the minimum wage of foreign workers is more of an election propaganda which will severely affect the foreign workers employed in the IT sector. Such a move will push for local hiring and will further tighten the rules of employment for foreign workers,” said Sumit Batra, partner at India Law Alliance.
IT industry sources said that poll related cyclical risks have played a crucial role in the growth of the sector and IT services growth in India has moderated in each of the last three US presidential election years. Nasscom is internally discussing the potential impact if the decision comes through.
But most Indian IT companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, TechM and HCL have started reducing their H-1B visa dependence in the last three years. Some of the firms have been hiring locally. US tech firms, however, have been a key recipient of H-1B visas in 2019.",business
Murugappa clan riven by feud," The stage is set for another tussle in the Murugappa family. Shareholders of Ambadi Investments Ltd (AIL), the holding company of the Murugappa group, have voted against inducting Valli Arunachalam as a director.
Arunachalam is the eldest daughter of the former executive chairman M.V. Murugappan. Early this year, Arunachalam, the US-settled nuclear scientist, had said in an interview that she was being denied a board berth just because she is a woman.
M.V. Murugappan had passed away in September 2017, leaving a probate will bequeathing his 8.15 per cent stake in the group holding firm, Ambadi Investments, to his wife and two daughters.

At an annual general meeting of the privately held AIL on Monday, around 91.36 per cent of its shareholders voted against a resolution that proposed a board position for Arunachalam.
“In any event, we would definitely pursue justice and we will take all the steps needed for the same.

August crude oil imports fall," Crude oil imports declined in August, though at a slower pace, as soaring coronavirus cases continued to hit mobility and slowed economic recovery, government data showed on Monday.
Crude oil imports last month fell about 23.4 per cent from a year earlier to 15.15 million tonnes, or 3.58 million barrels per day (bpd), data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the ministry of petroleum & natural gas showed.
On a monthly basis, imports rose 9.9 per cent from 13.79 million tonnes, or 3.26 bpd in July.
Fuel demand in the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer also slipped in August, posting its biggest monthly decline since April and a sixth consecutive year-on-year drop.

Shapoorji Pallonji Group says ‘time to separate from Tata’," Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group, the largest minority shareholder with 18.37 per cent stake in Tata Sons, on Tuesday said it is “time to separate from Tata” to end a relationship that has spanned over 70 years. Tata Sons is the holding company of Tata Group.
In a press statement, the SP Group said: “It stated before the Supreme Court that a separation from the Tata Group is necessary due to the potential impact this continuing litigation could have on livelihoods and the economy.”
“They stated that it was crucial that an early resolution is reached to arrive at a fair and equitable solution reflecting the value of the underlying tangible and intangible assets,” the statement added.
The SP Group and Tatas have been engaged in a bitter legal battle ever since Cyrus Mistry was sacked as chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016.
“Tata Sons has amplified its institutional efforts to suppress and inflict irreparable harm on the SP Group, in the midst of a global crisis triggered by the COVID pandemic,” the SP Group said.
The Mistry family was in the midst of raising funds against the security of their personal assets to meet the crisis arising from the global pandemic. This move was undertaken to protect the livelihoods of its 60,000 employees and over 1,00,000 migrant workers, it added.
“The action by Tata Sons to block this crucial fund raise, without any heed for the collateral consequences, is the latest demonstration of their vindictive mindset,” the statement said.
Maintaining that the current situation has forced the Mistry family to sit back and reflect on the past, present and possible future for all stakeholders, the SP group said: “The past oppressive actions and the latest vindictive move by Tata Sons that impact the livelihoods of the wider SP Group community leads to the inexplicable conclusion that the mutual co-existence of both groups at Tata Sons would be infeasible.”
The SP-Tata relationship, spanning over 70 years, was forged on mutual trust, good faith, and friendship. Today, it is with a heavy heart that the Mistry family believes that a separation of interests would best serve all stakeholder groups, it added.
When contacted, Tata Sons spokespersons declined to comment.
The SP Group claimed that as the largest minority shareholder owning an 18.37 per cent stake, the role hitherto played by it was always “one of guardianship with an aim to protect the best interests of the Tata group”.
“The SP Group had always used its voting rights as a shareholder for the best interest of the Tata Group. It is a matter of record that prior to the year 2000, when the Tata Trusts, being Public Charitable Trusts, couldn’t exercise their voting rights, the same being held by a Public Trustee, the SP Group voted to protect the best interests of the Tata Group,” it said.
The statement further said that after Cyrus Mistry was appointed as chairman of Tata Sons, he set about trying to establish a governance structure that would institutionalise accountability, and create the right checks and balances, without contravening the new Sebi insider trading law that regulated the flow of information across all stakeholders.
“Unfortunately, he was removed in October 2016, when he attempted to implement these governance reforms,” it added.
The statement by the SP Group further said: “It is extremely unfortunate that the current leadership of Tata Sons has not only continued to take value-destructive business decisions in a misguided effort to prove a point in these proceedings.”
It is a matter of public record that several issues identified years earlier continue to plague the group, be it the operations of Tata Steel UK, where over the last three years alone the operational losses have increased by an additional Rs 11,000 crore, or the Group's aviation businesses. These actions, or lack thereof, have meant that the total debt in the major Tata group companies has increased by approximately Rs 1,00,000 crore in the past three years, it added.
“Excluding TCS, the last quarter’s losses of all the listed group companies of approximately Rs 14,000 crore causes great concern. Unfortunately, the impact of these actions continue to hurt minority shareholders, be it the SP Group at Tata Sons or the millions of shareholders of the listed companies in the Tata Group,” the statement said.",business
Rajan plan to stem bad loan crisis," Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday suggested the government to privatise select public sector banks, set up a bad bank to deal with NPAs and dilute the role of Department of Financial Services.  
The reforms are necessary to ensure the growth of banking government without 
the periodic boom-bust cycles, said a paper titled “Indian Banks: A Time to Reform?” co-authored by Rajan and former Reserve Bank deputy governor Viral Acharya. 
“Re-privatisation of select PSBs can then be undertaken as part of a carefully calibrated strategy, bringing in private investors who have both financial expertise as well 
as technological expertise; corporate houses must be kept from acquiring significant stakes, given their natural conflicts of interest,” the paper said.
Noting that the government obtains enormous power from directing bank lending, it said sometimes this power is exercised to advance public goals such as financial inclusion or infrastructure finance, sometimes it is used to offer patronage to, or exercise control over, industrialists.     
“Winding down the department of financial services in the ministry of finance is essential, both as an affirmative signal of the intent to grant bank boards and management independence and as a commitment not to engage in “mission creep” when compulsions arise to use banks for serving costly social or political objectives,” the paper noted.

MP Birla trio oppose court order restraining Harsh Vardhan Lodha," Harsh Vardhan Lodha and three cable manufacturing companies of the MP Birla group filed appeals against the trial court order which restrained Lodha from holding any office in any group entity.
Sources say Birla Corporation, the flagship of the group, will also file an appeal on Tuesday and a hearing at the division bench could start from Wednesday. The Lodhas are seeking an interim stay on the operation of the order.
The legal setback to Lodha, who is the chairman of all group companies, appeared to have unsettled the investor community. On the first trading day after the single bench order was passed, all four listed companies came off sharply in an already weak market. 
While the broader market shed a little over 2 per cent — Nifty 50 closed 2.21 per cent lower — the Birla Corp stock fell by 8.19 per cent. The cable companies — Universal Cable, Birla Cable and Vindhya Telelinks — also fared worse than the market, correcting 6.29 per cent, 3.76 per cent and 3.68 per cent, respectively. The appeal filed by Lodha and the three firms would revolve around what constitutes the controlling block of shares in the manufacturing companies. According to the submission made on Monday, Lodha would argue that the estate of late Priyamvada Devi Birla, was only a minority shareholder in the companies.
The estate, which is now governed by a committee of administrator pendente lite (APL committee), is one of the many shareholders of the larger promoter group, his counsel would argue before the division bench.
Sources in the Lodha camp pointed out that estate is conclusively defined by the inventory of assets unanimously prepared by joint administrators and produced in court in 2013.
Harsh Lodha — whose father late Rajendra Singh Lodha was handed the reign of MP Birla group in 2004 by a contentious will of late Priyamvada Birla — in his submission is also going to point out that despite the trial court acknowledging its limitation on jurisdiction over companies, it ordered all such promoter group entities to exercise voting rights in line with the direction of the APL committee. 
“The verdict seeks to change the composition of independent trust and societies run by trustees and managing committees by removing a member without giving any of them any hearing,” a source in the Lodha camp argued. Such entities hold over 14 per cent in Birla Corp. Birla camp had a different take. It argued that the controlling block of share — 62.9 per cent in Birla Corp — is part of the estate, a view taken by the single bench as well. 
The Birlas also contested that the inventory of the estate drawn up in 2013 is not full and final, noting that the Lodhas have made at least four submissions before the court seeking direction to prepare a final list.
“How come Lodha is now in control of the MP Birla group today? It is because he had stepped into the shoes of his father R.S. Lodha, who was the executor of late Priyamvada Birla’s will. Today, the APL Committee is in her shoes,” said a Birla source.",business
Bengal excise duty worry for liquor makers," Two industry bodies representing major foreign liquor manufacturers in the country have written to the Bengal government to make changes to a proposed excise duty structure for liquor in the state or delay its implementation in the current year.
The state had planned to bring in the new structure from September 2020 and had sought the industry’s opinion on setting the excise duties based on ex-distillery prices along with data on comparative prices of other states. But following requests from the industry for additional time to gather more data, the implementation has been deferred. 
The industry has estimated that the new structure, where there are 22 slabs of additional excise duty based on ex-distillery price, would inflate the cost of foreign liquor in the state by 40-90 per cent over those prevailing in March 2020.
In its representation to the state, the International Spirits and Wines Association of India and the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies have requested that the additional excise duty slabs be cut from 22 to 12, bringing in parity with neighbouring states and thwart the spread of spurious liquor.
Diageo-USL, Pernod Ricard, ABD Limited, Radico Khaitan, Beam Suntory, Bacardi, Moet Hennessey, Brown-Forman, William Grant, Campari and Mohan Meakin are part of these associations.

While the government has proposed that suppliers can charge 10 per cent higher than the lowest ex-distillery price, the associations want the state to consider this at 30 per cent and make the prices valid for a period of 12 months only. 
As an alternative the associations have also urged the government to consider the proposal of deferring the implementation of the new tax structure in 2020-21.
According to the associations, when most states are rationalising taxes (Odisha, Delhi) in order to bring MRP at such levels that revenue is maximised, Bengal has proposed a tax structure which will take MRPs even higher. They have estimated a 40-45 per cent drop in volume and 25 per cent shortfall in revenue if the proposed taxation structure is implemented in its current shape and form.
Sources however said that the government is not primarily in favour of deferring the rollout of the new tax structure any further, but would have to carefully weigh any revenue loss in the process.",business
Telcos to pay 10% of AGR dues by March," Telecom operators, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have pending adjusted gross revenue dues will have to pay 10 per cent of the total liability by March 31 irrespective of the part-payments made by them, according to government sources.
Operational telecom operators are expected to pay Rs 12,921 crore by March 31, of which around 80 per cent have to be paid by Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel.  
“The Supreme Court order is very clear that telecom operators have to make 10 per cent payment of the total dues as demanded by the DoT by March 31, 2021. 
“The DoT has already raised demand for full AGR dues. The 10 per cent payment to be made by this March will be calculated on the total AGR liability,” a DoT official said. 
The officer said operators can clear the balance dues in 10 yearly instalments from the next financial year. According to the officer, Vodafone Idea will have to pay around Rs 5,825 crore and Bharti Airtel Rs 4,398 crore against the total demand of Rs 58,254 crore and Rs 43,980 crore, respectively.

Mahindra & Mahindra mulls Ssangyong stake bid," Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is understood to be considering a $258 million (300 billion won) bid for its stake in Ssangyong Motor Company (SYMC) made by HAAH Automotive Holdings Inc, a US-based automobile distributor. Mahindra holds almost 75 per cent in the South Korean auto maker.
In August this year, M&M decided to reduce its stake in SYMC to less than 50 per cent even as the company indicated that it was open to the possibility of ceding control over SYMC in full or part. 
This was to induct potential investors into SYMC or to otherwise meet its funding requirements through other sources.
According to M&M’s annual report for 2019-20, as of March 31 2020 its investments in SYMC stood at Rs 2,450 crore, while its ownership interest was at 74.65 per cent. 
Shares of M&M on Monday settled almost five per cent lower on the bourses. 
On the BSE, it ended at Rs 622.35 — a drop of 32.10, or 4.90 per cent, over its last close. 
M&M was recently in news when the company said that it has terminated share purchase agreement with CLP India to sell the entire stake held by its step down arm Mahindra Renewables in Neo Solren Pvt Ltd (NSPL) for Rs 104.67 crore.",business
Dalmia OCL to invest Rs 100 crore to step up local production," Dalmia OCL, the refractory manufacturing arm of cement and sugar major Dalmia group, plans to invest Rs 100 crore over the next five years in a bid to step up indigenous production in India and bring down dependance on imports, especially from China.
Refractories are used in furnaces and kilns primarily in the steel and cement industry. At present, around 40 per cent of India’s requirement is met through imports. 
In a bid to de-risk and localise, Dalmia OCL on Monday announced the opening up of a 1.08-lakh-tonne brownfield capacity at Rajgangpur in Odisha to manufacture magnesia carbon refractory bricks. Phase 1 of the plant with a capacity of 36,000 tonnes has come up at an investment of Rs 20 crore. Two more phases would be added over the coming years.

“Current investment has been Rs 20 crore and we will be investing Rs 100 crore over the next 3-5 years to expand refractory manufacturing,” said Sameer Nagpal, CEO, Dalmia OCL.
The investment decision comes on the back of demand from the steel industry to localise the production of refractories in India amid rising geopolitical tension. Steel constitutes around 70 per cent of the refractory demand followed by cement at around 10-12 per cent and glass, non-ferrous metals and petrochemicals among the other sectors.

The primary reason for import has been the incremental cost of manufacturing which is 5-7 per cent lower in China mainly due to their cost competitiveness. But with adequate handholding from the domestic industry and government, Dalmia OCL expects the cost in India can be brought down over the next 6-12 months.
""It is important to do the initial hand holding by the customers. Some of them are demanding supply from India. Because of the momentum we have accelerated the setting up of capacity in India. We are also in discussion with the government on how to make domestic manufacturing more competitive,” Nagpal said.

Government must pick tab for waivers: Rajiv Mehershi panel," The Rajiv Mehershi panel on loan recast has proposed the government should bear the burden of any relief while the waiver of the contentious interest on interest be given only to a few borrowers, sources said.
The report on the impact of the waiver of interest and the waiver of interest on interest, or compound interest, on loan moratorium has indicated banks are a financial intermediary and have a responsibility to their depositors. The government appointed panel is under ex CAG Rajiv Mehrishi.
The panel has suggested the government should bear the burden and the sovereign should compensate the banks if relief has to be given.
Given the huge burden of interest on interest faced by borrowers, the government can limit the waiver to the the most vulnerable segments such as affordable housing, MSMEs and smaller education loans.
The committee has indicated a complete waiver of compound interes would tantamount to punishing the good borrowers for paying their loans on time.
The Mehrishi committee  has reportedly arrived at a compound interest sum of around Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore and the sovereign should bear the burden if they be waived.
Brokerage firm Macquarie had estimated that interest waiver will cost the banking system about Rs 2.1 lakh crore while waiver of compound interest will cost about Rs 15,000 crore.
The ministry of finance had set up this three-member expert committee on September 10, comprising former CAG Rajiv Mehrishi, former monetary policy committee member Ravindra H Dholakia and the former managing director of SBI and IDBI Bank B Sriram.
The report of the committee would assist the government in the assessment of providing relief to the bank borrowers on the issue of banks charging interest on loan installments deferred during the moratorium period due to the coronavirus pandemic.",business
SBI charges 0.35% extra for loan recast," State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday announced the details of its resolution framework to restructure Covid-19 related stress loans. 
Corporate borrowers will have to provide a personal guarantee of the promoters or a pledge of their shares. 
Individuals seeking a restructuring of their loans will have to pay an additional interest of 0.35 per cent annually over and above the current pricing for the remaining tenure of the loan though they will not be subject to any processing fee.
The country’s largest bank also launched a facility on its website to help retail customers check their eligibility for the one-time loan restructuring.
Last month, the RBI had announced a one-time restructuring scheme for personal loans and corporate borrowers affected by the pandemic. This will apply to only those accounts that existed in banks’  books as on March 1, 2020. Another crucial condition is that the accounts should be standard (performing) and also not in default for more than 30 days as on March 1, 2020.
SBI managing director (retail & digital banking) C. S. Setty said while retail customers can check their eligibility, if found eligible they will have to visit the respective branches to complete the other formalities such as the signing of papers. 
As of now, around 3,500 retail customers of the bank have accessed the portal and of them 111 are eligible and have got their reference number generated, he said.
The bank’s retail customer will be asked to fill his or her account number in the relevant segment on its website. After the completion of OTP validation and keying in the requisite information, customers will get to know their eligibility and receive a reference number. This reference number will be valid for 30 days and within which time customers can visit the branch to complete the required formalities. 
An  individual borrower will be considered as affected by the Covid-19 pandemic if his or her salary in August 2020 got reduced  compared with February 2020, or there is a reduction/suspension in salary during the lockdown period. The individual can get home and other related loans, education, auto and personal loans restructured. The tenure of the loan can be extended for maximum 24 months under the framework for Covid -19 related stress.
The restructuring process will be complete after the verification of documents and execution of simple documents at the branch or the processing centre. Once an application is submitted, it will be processed within 7-10 working days.
The customer will have to upload or submit documents like salary slips for the month of February and latest salary slip apart from a declaration of estimated salary or income immediately after the end of the desired moratorium period (maximum 24 months) or a letter of discharge from job in case of job loss.
However, customers whose application has been accepted will be required to pay additional interest of 0.35 per cent per annum over and above their current pricing for the remaining tenure of the loan. SBI said that this is to offset partial cost of additional provisions required to be made.
For non-personal borrowers, SBI said that in case of unlisted entities, personal guarantee of the promoters will have to be furnished and for listed companies, promoters will have to pledge their shares. In these cases, a processing fee or upfront fee of 0.25 per cent of the `aggregate limits’ will be payable. SBI added that for loans with aggregate exposure of Rs 1500 crore and above from the banking system, last date for submitting application is November 15 and for others, the last date to apply for relief under the November 30.",business

Stocks collapse on fresh virus scare," Wall Street’s main indices tumbled to their lowest in nearly seven weeks on Monday, with the Dow shedding as much as 900 points, as worries about fresh coronavirus-driven lockdowns spilled over from Europe. Back home, the Sensex crashed 812 points, while the Nifty finished below the 11300-mark.
While the selloff was in line with global trends, investor wealth worth Rs 4.23 lakh crore was wiped off. 
Investors were jittery following reports of Denmark, Greece and Spain imposing fresh restrictions on activities to tackle a surge in Covid-19 infections even as Britain was considering a second nation-wide lockdown.
The 30-share Sensex opened lower at 38812.69 and fell below the 38000-mark to hit a day’s low of 37938.53. It finally ended 811.68 points, or 2.09 per cent, lower at 38034,14, falling for the third straight session. The broader Nifty cracked 254.40 points, or 2.21 per cent, to finish at 11250.55.
“The markets sold off in a major way because of several factors such as reports about irregular financial dealings involving some of the major international banks and fears of a second-wave of pandemic in many parts of Europe. With the markets having run ahead of the economy, it is only probable that there will be higher level of volatility,’’ said Joseph Thomas, head of research,  Emkay Wealth Management.

Wheat MSP hiked by 2.6% to douse ire," The Centre has raised the minimum support price of wheat by Rs 50, or 2.6 per cent, to Rs 1,975 per quintal amid growing farmer unrest against two pieces of legislation that seeks to encourage contract farming and allow farmers to directly sell their produce to institutional buyers such as big traders and retailers by bypassing state-regulated mandis.
Besides, MSPs of lentil (masoor), gram, barley, safflower and mustard/rapeseed have been increased. 
The move came a day after Parliament approved two agriculture sector-reform bills which have been bitterly opposed by the opposition parties such as the Congress and Trinamul as well as from within ruling NDA alliance over apprehension that the new legislations might virtually end MSP-based procurement by the government. 
Farmer groups in Punjab, Haryana and some other states are also protesting the two bills — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. 
Tomar said the MSPs of six rabi crops were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, a move aimed at encouraging farmers ahead of the sowing operations of winter crops.

Announcing the increased MSPs for the six rabi crops for 2020-21 crop year (July-June) and 2021-22 marketing season, Tomar said MSP of gram has been increased by Rs 225 to Rs 5,100 per quintal. 
MSP of barley has been hiked by Rs 75 to Rs 1,600 per quintal. Lentil MSP has been hiked by Rs 300 to Rs 5,100 per quintal. 
MSP of mustard/ rapeseed have been raised by Rs 225 to Rs 4,650 per quintal, while that of saffflower has been hiked by Rs 112 to Rs 5,327 per quintal.
Analysts said the Modi-government support price does not address the structural shift in its agricultural policy which would have a significant impact on the farmers’ livelihood and food security of the country.
Biswajit Dhar of the Jawaharlal Nehru University said the two farm bills were meant to transform Indian agriculture to be export oriented.  
But the country’s bilateral FTA engagements as well as in the WTO, partner countries are unlikely to accept India’s export oriented stance, while its own market remains largely protected behind high tariffs. 
“But, before comprehensively opening India’s market to import, the government must have a plan in place for sustaining domestic food security and to also protect the livelihoods of almost 60 per cent of the workforce that is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture,” Dhar said.",business
"CBI books Kwality Ltd, directors over Rs 1,400cr bank fraud"," The CBI has booked dairy major Kwality Ltd and its directors for allegedly cheating a consortium of 10 banks, led by the Bank of India, of over Rs 1,400 crore through bloating of financial statements and diversion of loan funds, officials said Monday.

Nearly 11 days after registering an FIR in the case, the CBI conducted searches on Monday at eight locations in multiple cities including Delhi, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr (Uttar Pradesh), Ajmer (Rajasthan), Palwal (Haryana) on the premises of the company and its directors.

The CBI has registered the case against Kwality Ltd. -- which started as an ice-cream manufacturing company and diversified into milk-based products -- and its directors Sanjay Dhingra, Siddhant Gupta, Arun Srivastava besides other unidentified persons, the officials said.

The agency has acted on a complaint by the Bank of India.

""It was alleged in the complaint that the said accused had cheated the Bank of India-led consortium comprising BOI (lead bank), Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank, IDBI, Central Bank of India, Dhanlaxmi Bank, Syndicate Bank to the tune of Rs.1400.62 core (approx.),"" CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said.
They allegedly cheated the banks by way of diversion of bank funds, sham transactions with related parties, fabricated documents/receipts, falsified books of accounts and created false assets and liabilities etc, Gaur said.
In its complaint, the Bank of India, the lead member of 10-bank consortium, has alleged that the company manipulated its financial statements by bloating its business operations through overstatement of the sales. purchases, debtors. creditors and inventories to keep the fund flow from bank going.

The bank conducted a forensic audit of the company after it failed to repay loans.

""Out of the total sale of Rs.13,147.25 crore made by the company only Rs.7,017.23 crore was routed through the consortium accounts,"" the BOI has alleged.

It said a considerable amount of trading, sales and purchases were made ""without actual receipts of the same in factory premises and physical deliveries therefrom"".

""Supplies have been effected directly by the suppliers of the Company to the customers of the Company. These items being exempt from taxes, they are also not covered under VAT and GST regime.
These suppliers and customers appear unorganised in nature and appear to have a weak financial base to support such large volumes of business,"" the bank has alleged in its complaint which is now a part of the FIR.
The bank has alleged that a considerable amount of sales and purchases was settled without actual payments being received or made by the companies.
""Balance Confirmations in respect of receivables show huge deviations. Against total outstanding of Rs 1,807.57 crore parties have confirmed receivables of Rs 972.82 crore. Accordingly, it indicates inflation of receivables by Rs 834.75 crore,"" it alleged.
The bank has alleged that the accused directors acted dishonestly with the aid, consent and active connivance of each other, carried out the misappropriation and dishonest conversion of funds for their personal gains.
""The accused persons have given the shape and effect to the forgeries and fabrication as a result of which window dressing and cheating of Bank has been carried out. By their acts of misappropriation, cheating and frauds. the money entrusted to the accused persons for the permitted business purpose have been utilized for their own benefit causing wrongful loss to the Bank of India Consortium,"" it alleged.",business
Spend with benefits," Covid-19 has prompted both businesses and customers to turn to digital transactions. Transacting cashlessly with modes such as debit and credit cards, UPI and netbanking allows you to minimise contact and reduce the chances of being infected. 
With even local businesses going online,you can now buy just about anything from the safety of your home. 
E-commerce has come a long way in 2020. The digital habits formed now are likely to persist. Which brings us to the key point of this piece: shopping online is now a daily fact of life, but what’s the best way to transact?

Some modes of digital spending provide you no benefits beyond ease of use. But a feature-rich credit card not only provides those conveniences but also offers rewards such as cashbacks, freebies, and points you could convert into goods and services, the combined value of which may run into thousands of rupees every year. Here’s what you need to know about how to get the best out of your credit card.  Depending on the kind of credit card you have, many of your transactions may help you earn rewards. Rewards help you save money. The key is to maximise rewards with the help of the habit you have now developed, which is online shopping. 
Many cards tie up with online businesses and help you earn rewards on many transactions but also accelerated rewards on select transactions. For example, one online shopping credit card from a government bank gives five points per Rs 100 spent online and one point per Rs 100 on other eligible spends, but it offers 10 points per Rs  100 spent when you shop with partner websites such as Amazon. This helps you if you are already a regular shopper at the partner website. Over time, your accumulated points can be converted into gift vouchers that can help you make additional purchases.  Let’s consider your other options. If you opt for cash-on-delivery (COD), your benefits in terms of cashback and reward points is likely to be nil. The same may be true for netbanking and UPI where rewards such as discounts and cashback may be rare, one-time, or completely random. 
The only other digital payment instrument that may be able to provide you consistent benefits is your debit card. However, these rewards too may be limited. 
You may find that a credit card that provides above-average benefits for online shopping may be your best option. Not just that, a premium credit card for which there may be an annual charge may be able to provide bigger benefits than a lifetime free credit card. 
Refer to the table where online shopping via COD has no benefit whereas planned online shopping with partner websites can lead to rewards worth Rs 9,501 in a year.  To get the best out of your credit card, it is necessary to know the fine print to understand the rewards you’re eligible for. It’s also important that your card allows you to enjoy the lifestyle you desire. It should help you maximise the rewards from your unique spends. 
If you don’t already have such a card, you may research the market for one. For example, if you love shopping at brand ABC, then it’s not useful to have a card that incentivises shopping with brand XYZ. You must also understand if caps apply on your reward. For example, one card may offer reward points with a one-year expiry while another card may not expire your points. 
Similarly, one card may cap your cashback rewards in a month at Rs 750 while another card may let you enjoy unlimited cashbacks. Apart from these, your card may also provide privileges that help reduce costs and maximise gains. 
For example, many cards provide free lounge access at domestic or international airports, gift vouchers on reaching spending milestones such as Rs 1 lakh and joining or renewal gifts such as e-vouchers or reward points.  The benefits are attractive when one assumes that all credit card dues are being paid off in the same billing cycle. This allows the user to enjoy the card privileges and avoid late payment penalties as well as steep interest charges. Credit card debt is unsecured debt which is typically the most expensive form of borrowing. 
Therefore, it’s critical to be timely with the payments and not let the debt snowball. Late payments could lead to hefty charges that may reduce the gains through rewards. 
Use your credit card smartly, get greater value for your spends, but always pay your dues in time. This may prove more beneficial than a combination of cash-on-delivery, netbanking, debit cards and UPI.

Chip giant MediaTek ready for 5G in India," MediaTek, one of the top chip companies in the world, expects 5G mobile services will roll out in the country within a year, offering a market for its chips in the 5G devices in the country.
The company, based in Taiwan, powers more than 1.5 billion devices across the world. It caters to original equipment manufacturers such as Motorola, Oppo, Realme, Vivo, Samsung, Xiaomi, Lenovo, Sony, Broadlink, LG, Google, Amazon among others. MediaTek is a fabless semiconductor company, meaning it designs and markets chip but does not manufacture them.
“5G has been one of the verticals where we have been doing strong research and development over the last few years. We have launched the flagship products from our side. In India, the government does realise the importance of 5G. From MediaTek’s point of view, the chipsets are already available and our OEM partners have already launched 5G devices powered by MediaTek worldwide,” said Anku Jain, managing director, MediaTek India.
“In the next 12 months, there are high chances that 5G network would be available in India. The government realises its importance and in the current situation of the Covid-19 pandemic I feel this will expedite the whole process. As soon as that happens, I am sure our OEM partners will announce devices for India,” Jain said.
Smartphones and tablets constitute around 43-48 per cent of the revenue of MediaTek, while the remaining revenue is from smart devices and connectivity solutions such as WiFi and bluetooth. A transition to 5G would aid MediaTek to consolidate its presence in India further amid the changing global dynamics of application processors.

Jain said the company would follow a two-pronged approach to grow its presence in India. This includes more research from its two centres in Noida and Bangalore and increasing revenue with the adoption of 5G and smart devices in the country. According to Counterpoint Research, MediaTek has been able to increase its market share in the application processor category to 38 per cent from 32 per cent in India in the second quarter of 2020 reflecting a global trend amid the shift in competitive dynamics in the sector.

Business sentiment improves in July-September quarter," India Inc’s business sentiment has improved during the July-September quarter as the government gradually unlocked the economy and business activity resumed, according to the CII’s business outlook survey.
The latest CII Business Confidence Index has surged to the level of 50.3 in July-September 2020, bouncing back from its lowest reading of 41.0 recorded in April-June 2020, the industry chamber said in a statement. 
“The stellar recovery in the index has been supported by the remarkable increase in the Expectations Index (EI), which rose 46 per cent quarter-on-quarter, to the level of 55.2, as nationwide lockdown restrictions were lifted and businesses gradually began to reopen during the July-September quarter,” it added. 
CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said while a recovery is underway, it could be tremendously expedited through continued government support and handholding of businesses during this crisis. 
The survey was conducted during August-September 2020 and saw the participation of over 150 firms across different sectors. Over half of the respondents stated that the weakness in domestic demand is likely to be the topmost risk to business confidence in the next six months. 
“More than a third of the respondents (35 per cent) foresee a contraction higher than 4 per cent in India’s GDP in 2020-21 as the significant setback to economic growth has been aggravated by state-imposed lockdowns to curb local outbreaks,” the statement added.",business
21 states to tap RBI for GST shortfall," As many as 21 states, mostly ruled by the BJP or parties which have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall in the current fiscal, sources said on Sunday. 
The states and Union Territories (UTs) which have intimated their decision to the Centre are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. 
Finance ministry sources said Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, 
Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Bengal are yet to respond to the GST Council proposal to decide their options. 
The states which do not submit their borrowing options before the GST Council meet on October 5, 2020 will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022, the sources said. 
The GST Council needs only 20 states to pass any resolution, in case voting is required on any issue, the sources added.
In the current fiscal, the states are staring at a staggering Rs 2.35 lakh crore GST revenue shortfall. Of this, according to the Centre’s calculation, a shortfall of about Rs 97,000 crore is on account of GST implementation and the rest Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the impact of Covid-19 on states’ revenues. 
The Centre has given two options to the states — to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market.",business
Small NBFCs seek refinance and relaxation in PSL norms," Small and medium sized non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have sought a refinancing body on the lines of the National Housing Bank (NHB) and further relaxation in the priority sector lending (PSL) norms for banks.
According to the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC), a representative body of NBFCs, bank funding of small and medium NBFCs has been a challenge because of various reasons, particularly during the last two years.
The poor response to the Targeted Long Term Repo Operations 2.0, which mandated banks to invest at least 50 per cent of the stipulated amount in small and medium NBFCs, was an evidence of the relatively poor funding by banks.
In a letter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the FIDC has said there is a need to reduce the over-reliance on banks and have a dedicated refinancing body. It said this role could be assigned to Sidbi and Nabard and these institutions could fund by way of term loans for a tenure of 3-5 years.
The body also pointed out that a vast majority of loans given by NBFCs to MSMEs and individuals are for an average tenure of 24 to 48 months and, therefore, it is imperative that NBFCs need to borrow for a commensurate period to maintain a healthy asset liability match. However, at present, funding under the partial credit guarantee scheme, the special liquidity scheme are all for a short tenure of 6-18 months. The FIDC urged that the tenure be increased to at least 36 months.

While bank lending to NBFCs for on-lending to the priority sector is treated as priority sector lending for banks and the sectoral limit has been kept at five per cent, the body wants this to be increased to 10 per cent. It has also said that there is an artificial cap of Rs 20 lakh per loan put on such on-lending transactions which may be done away with. ",business
Pandemic pool for MSME wage cover," An insurance panel has proposed the creation of a pandemic pool and a policy shield to protect the wages of individuals working in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 
Business interruption losses suffered by MSMEs on account of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown are at present not covered by traditional insurance policies. 
“The covers for these losses are not provided by the market as it is beyond the risk appetite of the insurance and reinsurance market. If insurance companies are required to cover such claims, such an action would create substantial solvency risks for the sector, significantly undermining the ability of insurers to pay other types of claims and exacerbate the negative financial and economic impacts,” the panel said in its report.
Hence, the working group, comprising insurance industry officials and members of IRDAI, has proposed the creation of a pandemic pool and an associate insurance cover that protects up to three months of wages of individuals working in MSMEs that employ up to 10 persons in the first phase. The premium for the product is estimated at Rs 999 per employee.
This will be later scaled up to cover salary charges of MSMEs with more than 10 employees. 
The initial pool size has been proposed at Rs 5,000 crore with the government providing a backstop guarantee of Rs 75,000 crore. 
“Pandemic is a risk that the industry cannot handle. It’s like nuclear disaster or terrorism risk. The reason is the risk is too high for insurance companies to handle and the premium is not there for it,” Sarbvir Singh, CEO, Policybazaar.com, told The Telegraph.
Singh said that while the pandemic pool will make it easier for insurers and reinsurers to manage risk, it is necessary to make the product accessible to the MSMEs.
“Right now, MSMEs come under the commercial lines of insurance. Big brokers who only focus on relatively large companies serve this category. It is necessary to see that MSME insurance like retail insurance is easier for companies to buy. This will make the base widespread,” Singh said.",business
Wait for Centre's borrowing plan," The finance ministry in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will decide the borrowing calendar for the second half of the current fiscal in the last week of this month, sources said.  
According to the announcement made in May, the government intends to borrow the remaining Rs 5.02 lakh crore out of the Rs 12 lakh crore during the October-March period to meet rising expenditure to combat the Covid-19 crisis amid the moderation in tax collections.    
The exact date for the meeting to decide the borrowing calendar is yet to be fixed but most likely it should happen in the last week of this month, the sources said. 
The government had envisaged to raise 58 per cent of the total borrowing target of Rs 6.98 lakh crore from the dated securities in the first half of the current fiscal. 
During the first quarter of 2020-21, the central government issued dated securities worth Rs 3,46,000 crore against Rs 2,21,000 crore in the same period a year ago. In the second quarter, the borrowing through dated papers has touched Rs 3.60 lakh crore as of September 18.

Thus, the total borrowing so far this fiscal has been Rs 7.06 lakh crore, exceeding the government borrowing plan of Rs 6.98 lakh crore. This leaves room for borrowing of less than Rs 4.94 lakh crore in the second half of the financial year. 
One more borrowing, according to the calendar is likely to take place on September 25 of Rs 30,000 crore. After that, the borrowing for the remaining six months of the current fiscal will be limited to Rs 4.64 lakh crore if the government does not raise its borrowing level beyond Rs 12 lakh crore. 
Hard-pressed for funds to combat rising coronavirus infections, the government in May increased its market borrowing programme for the current financial year more than 50 per cent to Rs 12 lakh crore. 
In the 2020-21 Union budget presented in Parliament in February, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had pegged the gross market borrowing — which is also a reflection of fiscal deficit —  for the current fiscal at Rs 7.80 lakh crore. 
The amount was up from Rs 7.1 lakh crore in 2019-20. However, in view of the impact of the lockdown on tax collection and the need to garner additional resources to fight the pandemic, the government decided to substantially increase the market borrowing programme for the current fiscal by about 54 per cent or Rs 4.2 lakh crore.

Lodha to appeal against court curbs," The trial court order restraining Harsh Vardhan Lodha from all the entities of MP Birla Group will be contested by Lodha’s counsels on two key grounds when they file an appeal before the division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday.
The Lodha camp is likely to argue that the order extends the reach of the committee of administrator pendente lite (APL committee) to 30 entities — which include investment and manufacturing companies, trusts and societies — even though most of them were not part of the estate of late Priayamvada Devi Birla (PDB).
The Lodhas will also contest that part of the trial court order which allows the three-member APL committee, which was appointed by the HC in 2012 to oversee and protect the estate of late Priyamvada Birla, to take decision by a majority.

Justice Sahidhulla Munshi restrained Lodha on Friday from holding any position in the MP Birla group and drawing any benefit. Lodha will seek an immediate stay on the operation of the order before the division bench.
The legal feud between the Birla family and the Lodhas erupted in 2004 when late Rajendra Singh Lodha sought the probate of late Priyamvada’s purported will which landed the control of the MP Birla group to him and after his sudden demise in 2008, to his younger son Harsh.
Three of the four listed manufacturing companies have informed bourses they are  reviewing the matter.

The Birla camp argued that Lodha has ceased to be a director of all companies and if he attends any board meeting, gives direction or even enters the office premises of these entities, it would be construed as contempt of court.
Asked if the Birlas would move court again to enforce the trial court order, a source said: “We are reviewing the matter,” pointing out that communiques sent by the companies are inadequate.  The Lodha camp may argue that the extent of control of the committee is limited to the inventory of assets of the estate of late Priyamvada, which has been unanimously agreed upon by all sides multiple times. The inventory does not include the companies in which she did not hold shares personally, nor does it include trusts or societies which hold significant holding (14.35 per cent) in Birla Corporation Ltd.
However, around 30 third-party companies, trusts and societies holding shares in various companies of MP Birla Group, have been asked to exercise their voting right in accordance with the directions of the administrators by the trial court. 
A four-tier structure controls the five MP Birla Group manufacturing companies. While four — Birla Corp, Vindhya Telelinks, Universal Cables and Birla Cables — are listed, Hindustan Gum and Chemicals is unlisted. 
Such an order has been passed thereby taking away the voting right of such third party entities without hearing them, the Lodhas said.
Lodha may also point out that the APL committee in the past had written to the company secretary of Birla Corp giving proxy for 1,260 shares only, which late Priyamvada Birla directly held in her name.
Attention will also be drawn on how a division bench had made a distinction between Harsh Lodha as a legatee in a probate suit and Lodha as a director and chairman of a company. 
“The same court has previously made clear distinction between Harsh Lodha as chairman of Birla Corporation and Harsh Lodha as a proponent of the Will when the Birlas in 2016 made an unsuccessful attempt to block Birla Corporation's acquisition of Reliance Cement,” Debanjan Mandal, partner of Fox & Mandal and counsel for Lodha, said.
No restrictive order was passed by the probate court which held that it had no jurisdiction over outsiders. But that distinction was completely lost in Friday’s verdict, Mandal countered. The trial court allowed the APL committee to decide based on majority decisions. After retired judge Mohit Shah joined the committee, it has taken decisions which went against Lodha. It had asked all investment companies to vote against resolutions seeking the appointment of Lodha and profit-linked remuneration in listed companies.
Lodha’s counsels are likely to point out that twice in the past committee members had sought guidance from a division bench of the HC whether a decision can be taken by majority. However, no explicit order was granted.",business

Blackstone sells Essel Propack stake," American buyout major Blackstone on Friday sold a 23 per cent stake in Essel Propack, one of the largest manufacturers of laminated tubes used by FMCG and pharma companies, for a little over Rs 1,860 crore through open market transactions. 
The shares were picked up by Axis Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund and DSP Mutual Fund, Morgan Stanley, Neuberger Berman and Nomura.
According to BSE data, Blackstone, through its entity Epsilon Bidco PTE Ltd, sold a total of 7,25,80,090 shares, translating into a 23 per cent stake, of Essel Propack.

Nirmala roots for holistic code in insolvency process," Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said insolvency proceedings against corporate debtors as well as personal guarantors should be considered together for a comprehensive resolution.
Replying to members’ queries on the liability of personal guarantors in the IBC process in the Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman said, “The corporate debtor often has guarantors. So, for a comprehensive corporate insolvency resolution and liquidation, we felt it was necessary that the insolvency of the corporate debtor as well as its guarantors are considered together to whatever extent possible.”
The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed amendments to the insolvency law to suspend fresh insolvency proceedings for at least six months starting March 25 amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Sitharaman saying a decision on extending the suspension of the relevant provisions will be taken next week.
In June, an ordinance was promulgated to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Default on repayments from March 25, the day when the nationwide lockdown began, would not be considered for initiating insolvency proceedings for at least six months. 
The six-month period is ending next week.
The minister also clarified that insolvency proceedings against corporates defaulting on loans prior to March 25 will continue and the amendment will not stall those cases.
On queries about the urgency to bring the ordinance, Sitharaman said that “between sessions if there is a need for ordinance because the ground situation demands it, I would think a responsive government’s duty is to at least use the ordinance to show that we are there with the people of India”.
“The IBC Code is not a recovery law... Saving lives of companies is far more important than enabling recovery of loans... We have the compulsion to save businesses, (the) corporate sector and they need to be insulated rather than enabling creditors to recover the loan for which they have several other options,” the finance minister said.
“There are several other avenues through which recoveries can be done. One can use statutory options or supervised compromises and court-supervised compromises. One can even use the RBI’s prudential framework and arrangements which are available under the Companies Act can also be used,” she added.
Businesses are facing trouble because of the pandemic. So, it was decided “that it was better to suspend Sections 7, 9 and 10 of IBC so that we can prevent corporate persons experiencing distress on account of the unprecedented situation of being pushed into insolvency proceedings”, she said.
Sections 7, 9 and 10 deal with the initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process by financial creditors, operational creditors and corporate debtors, respectively.
Citing data for NPAs of commercial banks during 2018-19, Sitharaman informed the House that Lok Adalats recovered 5.3 per cent, debt recovery tribunals (DRTs) 3.5 per cent and SARFAESI 14.5 per cent. IBC ensured 42.5 per cent of recovery. ",business
Foreign investments in defence will be subject to scrutiny: Piyush Goyal," The government’s decision to ease the FDI norms in the defence sector will push self-reliance in production and keep national interests and security paramount, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday.
He said the foreign investments would be subject to scrutiny on the grounds of national security. The government has permitted 74 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in defence with certain conditions.
“Now, FDI is allowed up to 74 per cent through the automatic route and beyond 74 per cent to be permitted through the government (approval) route. This will enhance ease of doing business and contribute to growth of investment, income and employment,” Goyal said in a tweet.
“In line with our collective vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, amendments will enhance self-reliance in defence production, while keeping national interests and security paramount.”
The government has permitted foreign direct investment (FDI) of up to 74 per cent under the automatic route to attract overseas investors, according to a press note issued by the DPIIT.
However, the investments would be subject to scrutiny on the grounds of national security and the government reserves the right to review any foreign investment that affects or may affect national security, the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) said in the note.
At present, 100 per cent overseas investments are permitted in the defence industry — 49 per cent under the automatic route, while government approval is required beyond that level. 
The permit for up to 74 per cent FDI through the automatic route was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in May while announcing the fourth tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package for the coronavirus-hit economy.
In July 2018, the government had relaxed the foreign direct investment norms in the defence sector by allowing up to 49 per cent FDI under the automatic route.
According to DPIIT data, defence industries have received FDI equity inflows of $9.52 million (Rs 56.88 crore) between April 2000 and March 2020. 
Under the government route, foreign investors have to take prior approval of the respective ministry/department, while in the automatic route, the investor just has to inform the RBI. ",business
Govt tightens rule for domestic procurement," Foreign entities of countries which do not allow Indian companies to participate in their government buying will not be permitted to take part in domestic procurement, an official statement said on Friday. 
The government has also mandated a higher minimum local content from domestic suppliers. The limits for Class I and Class II local suppliers, at 50 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, will be raised.
The changes in the procurement norms would not violate the global trade pacts as India is not a signatory to the WTO’s government procurement agreement and gives ample flexibility for the government to formulate policies, Biswajit Dhar, trade economist with JNU, said.
The government has added a reciprocity clause in its Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, 2017.

Trai issues rules for publications and ads on tariff plans," Telecom regulator Trai on Friday issued a fresh set of rules for publication and advertisement of tariff plans by telcos, in a bid to boost transparency in mobile offers and to help subscribers make informed decisions. 
The move assumes significance as telecom subscribers often grapple with issues such as lack of information and vague plan details — a situation that affects subscribers’ ability to make proper choices. 
Tightening the rules for telcos, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Friday issued directions on tariff publication and tariff advertisements.

“It has been observed that existing measures adopted by telecom service providers are not transparent as they should be and that some of the telecom service providers are not prominently highlighting additional terms and conditions. 
“They are also collating the terms and conditions applicable to various tariffs on a single web-page and that the relevant information either gets lost in the maze of details or becomes ambiguous and incomprehensible to consumers,” the Trai directive said.

Trai has now directed telcos to publish, service area wise — within 15 days — each tariff plan for postpaid and prepaid subscribers, and offer full information to subscribers at customer care centres, points of sale, retail outlets and websites, and apps with requisite disclosures. 
The “essential disclosures”, mandated in Trai’s directive, include information on units/volume of voice, data and SMS, and its rates, limits of usage rates and speeds beyond entitled use. Telcos will also have to transparently inform subscribers about upfront cost along with details such as advance rentals, deposits, connection fee for postpaid services as well as top-up, tariffs vouchers and others. 
Trai asserted that “clear, unambiguous and easy to understand” disclosures also have to be made on the validity period of the tariff plan and the last date of bill payment. ",business
Apple to launch online store in India next week," Apple on Friday said it will launch its online store in India next week, offering its full range of products to customers across the country for the first time, a move that will help the tech giant cash in on the festive demand.
The online store, which will be launched on September 23, will provide customers with the same premium experience found in Apple Store locations around the world, delivered by online team members who are ready to offer their expertise, Apple said in a statement. 
In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said the company will launch its online store in India later this year, while its first physical retail store will open in the country in 2021. 
“We know our users are relying on technology to stay connected, engage in learning, and tap into their creativity, and by bringing the Apple Store online to India, we are offering our customers the very best of Apple at this important time,” Apple senior vice-president of Retail + People, Deirdre O’Brien, said.

The online store will allow people to shop for Apple products, with online Apple specialists available to help with services like custom-configuring Macs to setting up new devices. Customers can get advice, receive guidance, and learn about new products directly from Apple, both in English and Hindi, the statement said.
The online store will  offer financing options and trade-in programmes. All orders from the Apple Store online will ship with contactless delivery. ",business
Google bars Paytm from play store for violating gambling policy," Google on Friday restored the Paytm app on its Play store after removing it for violating its policy on sports betting activities. The app was back on the Google Play store on Friday evening after the Softbank-backed Paytm removed the “cashback” feature from a recently-launched game on the application.
Google had removed Paytm from Play Store for violation of its gambling policies.
Paytm’s fantasy sports app — Paytm First Games (PFG) — had also been barred.
Incidentally, on Tuesday, PFG had brought in cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador as it looked to cash in on the Indian Premier League (IPL) fever.
Google’s decision was prompted by Paytm’s move to allow its customers to collect cricket cards linked to their purchases or payments. Once a customer collected five such cards, he or she would earn a cashback.
In a blog post, Suzanne Frey, vice-president, product, Android security and privacy, said Google did not allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting.
“If an app leads consumers to an external website that allows them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies. We have these policies to protect users from potential harm. When an app violates these policies, we notify the developer of the violation and remove the app from Google Play until the developer brings the app into compliance,” she added.
Paytm, which has more than 50 million monthly active users, sought to assuage its customers saying all their account balances “are 100 per cent safe”. 
Paytm added that all its services are fully functional.
Paytm disclosed that it has temporarily removed the cashback component in an effort to meet the Play Store policy requirements.
While it is learnt that Google had notified the developers of Paytm a few days ago, its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma told a television news channel that while Google’s decision has surprised them, an email was sent only after informing that the application has been taken down.  Staff Reporter, Calcutta: Consumers are in favour of the government prohibiting the advertisements of gaming platforms that encourage gambling.
According to a survey by LocalCircles, ads from gaming platforms were one area with which most consumers were not happy.

Calcutta HC restrains Harsh Vardhan Lodha from holding position in MP Birla Group," Harsh Vardhan Lodha has been restrained from holding any position in the MP Birla Group by Calcutta High Court, handing the Birla family its most significant victory in the 16-year long legal tussle. The trial court judgment on Friday also restrained Lodha from drawing any benefit from the estate of the late Priyamvada Devi Birla. Lodha is the chairman of all manufacturing companies of the MP Birla Group.
Lodha is seeking probate of a will of late Priyamvada Devi Birla, wife of Late Madhava Prasad Birla, which handed the control of the group to late Rajendra Singh Lodha, father of Harsh Vardhan. 
A testamentary suit is being heard in the high court at present.

The leash on Lodha will remain till the pendency of the suit, the judgment said, citing the requirement “to prevent apprehended wrong or anticipated mischief”.
“Following this order, Lodha has ipso facto vacated his office either as a director, or as a trustee or governing body member from all entities of MP Birla Group, which includes flagship Birla Corporation,” N. G. Khaitan, senior partner of Khaitan & Co and counsel for Birlas, commented. Birlas win big in trial court, Lodhas to appeal

Lodha was elected director of key MP Birla companies by a majority of over 90% The Lodhas said the order passed by Justice Sahidullah Munshi “does not appear to be lawful”. Debanjan Mandal, partner of Fox & Mandal, advocates for Harsh Lodha, said the orders passed on Friday were not even asked for and will be challenged on this ground. 
“Our client’s confidence in the system remains completely unshaken and our client will challenge the judgment in the appeal court for immediate and long term relief,” Mandal said.
Administrators
Even as a three-member committee of administrator pendente lite (APL committee) was appointed by the court in 2012 to oversee the estate of late Priyamvada till the 
pendency of the probate matter, a significant disagreement arose in 2019 when the committee asked all investment companies, trusts and societies to vote against the reappointment of Lodha on the boards of Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Cables.
This year they again asked, by a majority decision, to vote against Lodha’s appointment in Birla Corporation and Universal Cables. 
Lodha maintained that the APL Committee must decide unanimously and its direction is limited to only those shares the directly held by the estate. In flagship Birla Corporation, the estate cast its voting rights against only 1,260 shares, while the promoters’ block consists of 62.9 per cent share.
Justice Munshi rejected both the Lodha contentions which may have long term impact on not only how the companies are managed but also many public institutions such as schools and hospitals are run.
The judgment read: “It is thus apparent that within its power and authority, the APL Committee has the right to exercise all such powers and perform all such acts as late Priyamvada Devi Birla would have exercised had she been alive. 
“Priyamvada Birla had a controlling share in the investment companies either by direct investment or along with other investment companies.”
“This view has been confirmed by both the division and single bench of this court and, in view thereof, the APL Committee is well within its powers to ask all entities which were under the control of Priyamvada Devi Birla to exercise their voting rights with regard to their investment in the share capital of any of the companies which were under the control of Priyamvada Devi Birla, in the manner considered by the APL as beneficial to the interest of the Estate,” it added.
“All these entities of the group would have exercised their voting rights in accordance with the directions of Priyamvada Devi Birla had she been alive. 
“Accordingly, now such entities would exercise their voting rights flowing from their investment in the companies controlled by Priyamvada Birla in the manner to be guided by the APL Committee,” the judgment said.
Khaitan said: “It has been established beyond doubt that the majority decision of the Administrators is binding on the Lodhas and their decisions have to be implemented in full. 
“Justice Munshi has further held that all the companies and entities holding shares of MP Birla Group have to vote in accordance with the direction of the Administrators. This is a path-breaking judgment which was necessary for protection and preservation of the estate.”
Decision by majority
The judgment suggested that Lodha should have raised his objection to the APL committee taking any decision by majority long ago and by not doing so thus far, he cannot agitate now. 
“In my view once the parties allowed themselves and they participated in the meeting without raising any objection that its decision if not unanimous cannot be deliberated in the meeting and after resolution has been adopted by majority it is no more open for the plaintiffs to agitate that the APL’s decision ‘by majority’ is not binding on them,” the judgment read.
Shareholders’ right
The Lodhas said the judgment did not uphold the right of the shareholders. 
“It has all along been the case of the Lodhas that the probate court examining the validity of a Will has no jurisdiction over any company in which late Priyamvada held shares. Though the inherent lack of jurisdiction was observed in the verdict in respect of the companies, Lodha has been injuncted from holding office of directors in the board of companies which the court itself said was beyond its remit,” Mandal said. 
All resolutions pertaining to Lodha’s appointment or his remuneration linked to profit in all four manufacturing companies were passed with an overwhelming majority in the AGMs of the companies.",business
Birla blow to Lodhas in court," The Birlas on Friday clinched a major victory in the 16-year battle with the Lodhas over the control of the MP Birla Group.
Calcutta High Court ruled that Harsh Vardhan Lodha — whose late father R.S. Lodha was given control of the group in July 2004 under the terms of Priyamvada Birla’s contentious will — could not hold any office in any of the entities of the M.P. Birla Group. It also restrained him from drawing any benefit personally out of the assets of the MP Birla estate.
Justice Sahidullah Munshi, who delivered the verdict, said that the three-member committee of administrators, which had been appointed in 2012 to oversee the affairs of the MP Birla estate, would “exercise all such powers and perform all such acts as the late Priyamvada Birla would have exercised had she been alive”.

According to the suit, bank officials “engaged in a plan, scheme, conspiracy and course of conduct, pursuant to which they knowingly or recklessly engaged in acts, transactions, practices and courses of business which operated as a fraud and deceit”, resulting in the losses to investors. 
The allegations pertain to the vehicle finance vertical, where the bank later acknowledged to have found some improprieties which resulted in some executives being acted against.
The bank had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, maintained improper lending practices in the vehicle financing making the operations unsustainable and all this was likely to have a negative impact on its financial condition and reputation, it alleged.",business
GST: Covid ruse to silence automakers," Covid-19 — infamously characterised as an Act of God by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman — has again come in as a handy excuse for a glowering response from the Narendra Modi government to silence the first rumblings of protest from automakers.
Some auto firms have had the temerity to suggest that the high goods and service tax (GST) rate has badly stalled recovery in the industry.
On Thursday, finance ministry sources sent out a stern message to the automakers: cut manufacturing costs and pare royalty payments to overseas parent firms instead of trying to pressure the government to cut GST rates.
The brouhaha over GST rates burst into the open on Tuesday when Toyota Kirloskar vice-chairman Shekar Viswanathan told Bloomberg in an interview that the carmaker had decided not to expand operations in India because of the country’s high tax regime.
“The message we are getting, after we have come here and invested money, is that we don’t want you,” Viswanathan said in that interview. In the absence of any reforms, “we won’t exit India, but we won’t scale up”.
Viswanathan’s statement resonated with other automakers and the rumblings of dissent over the high taxes started to begin, prompting Union heavy industries minister Prakash Javadekar to say in a tweet later that evening: “The news that Toyota Company will stop investing in India is incorrect. Vikram Kirloskar has clarified that Toyota will invest more than Rs 2,000 core in the next 12 months.”
Kirloskar, a minority partner in the car venture, stepped in to try and end the rumpus with his own soothing tweet: “Absolutely! We are investing over Rs 2,000 crore in electric components for the domestic customer and exports. We are committed to the future of India.”
The mild damage-control exercise didn’t apparently work as other automakers turned equally restive though they were too scared to issue public statements.
The government has now decided to come out with a more aggressive response to quell criticism over its tax regime at a time when it is trying to woo foreign investors to set up shop in India.
Driving etiquette says you must not dazzle a flustered car driver in a sudden face-off with a luminous high-beam response — but the government has chosen to do exactly that.
“If the regulatory environment was not conducive, it would be hard to imagine new players investing heavily in vehicle-manufacturing facilities like Jeep, Kia Motors and MG Motor, to name a few. Those companies which can feel the pulse of the Indian consumer and deliver accordingly are ruling the roost,” a source said.
The suggestion to cut royalty payout to overseas parents is unusually aggressive since the royalty was the real reason the Japanese and South Korean automakers invested in India in the first place. Most pay royalties between 3 and 5 per cent. In the case of small global automakers like Suzuki Motors, this is a critical source of revenue.
Maruti Suzuki paid Rs 38.2 billion — amounting to 5 per cent of its revenues — in royalties to its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, according to its annual report. Toyota Motor’s India arm paid $88 million or 3.4 per cent of revenue to its Japanese parent, government data showed. Automakers have not responded to the government’s suggestion to cut royalties but maintain that it is becoming hard to do business in India because of the high tax rates.
Shashank Srivastava, executive director of Maruti Suzuki India, told The Telegraph: “India’s GDP per capita is low by international standards and because of our demographics profile we have a large number of first-time buyers who buy more value cars. These two factors make for a high elasticity of demand as regards the cost of acquisition of cars. The high sensitivity of buyers to the cost of acquisition makes it imperative to keep the costs low if the industry has to tap the big upside potential that comes from the current low car penetration in our country.”
He said automakers try to optimise costs relating to components, labour, productivity, logistics and retailing. But the costs outside their control are regulatory and statutory costs like road taxes, registration taxes, insurance costs, GST, cess, etc.
Therefore, the industry often appeals for the reduction of the costs of acquisition arising from these elements. “The government obviously has to take appropriate decisions on these based on the overall economy,” Srivastava said.
But an increasingly truculent government is not prepared to listen to any form of criticism and, instead, insists that automobile taxes in India are among the lowest in the world.
A finance ministry source said: “The GST rates on automobiles are less than what value-added tax (VAT) and excise duty rates used to be in pre-GST times. The tax policy on automobiles has been quite consistent for the last three decades and we have incentivised domestic manufacturing by providing reasonable protection from imports. Industry has, on its part, also delivered on its side of the bargain. It has contributed by making large investments and increasing employment.
“This sudden dissent in some quarters on tax rates on automobiles is surprising. These companies should cut down their costs of manufacturing by cutting down the royalty payments to their parent companies abroad instead of asking the government to reduce GST.”
The source suggested the response was coming from frustrated automakers who were unable to stand the heat of competition.
The official said that Japan currently imposed three types of taxes on automobiles: once on purchase, then an annual automobile tax based on engine size and, finally, a weight tax at inspections required once every two years. Over and above this, there is GST at the highest applicable rate, the official said.
Sources also cited the example of the EU where the base rate for VAT/GST on automobiles ranges from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, with a string of other taxes varying with jurisdiction.
“The UK charges vehicle excise duties that vary with car emission norms and has 14 rate slabs varying from zero to £2,175 a year with a surcharge of £325 in the first year and £150 for expensive vehicles,” a source said.
“Besides, there are road usage charges. Further, high parking charges are common across the globe. Most of the countries provide certain concessions to electric vehicles. Given this, it would be unfair to claim that the GST rates in India are astounding or a demand dampener.”
Ravi Bhatia, president and director, JATO Dynamics, an automotive research firm, said: “It is not wrong for industry to seek a stable policy framework and globally comparable taxation regime. ‘Make in India’ can happen only when the government puts money where its mouth is.”
He added: “We have idle capacity and that hurts profitability in a very big way. This sector also has employment generation potential which is not being utilised…. For a country which can economically benefit from improving mobility, the auto sector wants to be seen as a facilitator of economic growth and not a burden or a sin good.”
It is hard to say why the dissent has erupted now after months of poor automobile sales.
One view is that the carmakers want to head off the possibility of the GST Council tinkering with rates again — especially raising the compensation cess on high-end cars — at a time when the Centre is locked with the states in a battle over unpaid dues and inadequate compensation payouts to make up for the shortfall.
The issue is likely to come to a head on October 5 when the GST Council is to meet with the states, which are being asked to vote on two stark and disagreeable options: either borrow a sum of Rs 97,000 crore from a special window to be created by the Reserve Bank of India to meet a small part of the expected Rs 3 lakh crore shortfall in GST collections this year, or raise the entire uncovered sum of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the form of debt.
The GST compensation cess is expected to raise a paltry Rs 65,000 crore this year, creating a gaping hole in the states’ finances.
The Modi government has broken a circle of trust after it disclaimed its constitutional obligation to compensate the states for any annual shortfall in tax collections this year.
Automakers fear that the compensation cess -- which is levied on cigarettes, pan masala, aerated drinks and cars that are more than 4 metres long — might be raised to meet a part of the dues, which would wreck their operations.
The GST Council was supposed to meet on Saturday but will now meet after the end of the current session of Parliament.",business
GM Indian plant sale delay to result in hefty unplanned costs," Delays in General Motors’ sale of its Indian plant to Great Wall Motor because of tensions between India and China are likely to result in hefty unplanned costs for the US automaker, people familiar with the matter said.
Gaining approval from the Indian government for China-related deals is now expected to take quite some time and although the sale should still happen at some point, GM has not changed its plan to begin winding down the plant’s operations next month, they said.
“By next year, it will either be a closed GM site or it will be an operating site with Great Wall,” said one source.
GM had planned to use the expected sale proceeds of $250 million-$300 million to pay off liabilities incurred with its exit from manufacturing in India in what a second source said would have been a “no gain-no loss” situation.
Although money will come through once the deal is done, it will now have to pay out of pocket for severance pay, some of which would never have occurred had the deal proceeded smoothly, as well as other costs — which could amount to a couple hundred million dollars, according to the second source.",business
Vodafone Idea Ltd drops faster data speed claims," Faced with regulatory heat on its controversial plan, Vodafone Idea Ltd has dropped faster data speed claims, which formed a prominent part of its pay-more-for-priority-treatment offering, and has filed a revised plan with Trai, a source said.
The move assumes significance as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) late last month slapped a showcause notice on VIL over its priority mobile plan, saying the tariff offer lacked transparency, was “misleading” and not in compliance with regulatory framework. 
The source said the company has now submitted a new RedX plan with Trai and claims of faster data speeds — a major bone of contention — has been done away with.
The company’s website is also no longer touting claims of faster speeds for RedX plan, which had been under Trai’s scanner over the past few weeks. 
Instead, VIL’s website is talking of benefits purely in terms of entertainment privileges (Netflix and Amazon Prime), travel privileges, mobility benefits and other privileges. 
In the new RedX plan, which has now been filed with Trai, the company has withdrawn the claim of “priority 4G network as compared to other Vodafone postpaid plans”, the source added. 
VIL’s spokesperson declined to comment on the issue.
The regulator had, on August 25, issued a showcause notice asking the company “why appropriate action should not be initiated against it for violating the extant regulatory framework by its RedX tariff plan”.",business
Irdai considering to extend tenure of Covid-specific offerings," Insurance regulator Irdai is considering a plan to extend the tenure of Covid-19 specific products as the vaccine for the disease is likely to take some more time, its chairman Subhash C. Khuntia said on Thursday.  
The watchdog is also working towards facilitating a standard product for coronavirus, which will be easy to understand and will not require “voluminous policy documents”. 
“With regard to extending the tenure of the Covid-19 related products, we are hoping that the vaccine would not be delayed for too long. But now that it appears that it will take some more time, we will take a decision about extending the tenure of the policy at an appropriate time,” Khuntia said while addressing the CII Insurance and Pensions Summit webcast. 
Corona Kavach, launched on July 10 and is being offered by both general and health insurers, is a standard health insurance policy created to meet the treatment requirements for coronavirus infection.  
The term of the policy ranges from three-and-a-half months to nine-and-a-half months, with a maximum insured amount at Rs 5 lakh. 
On new Covid-19 insurance products, Khuntia said, “We are coming out with a standard product which is to be sold by all the companies so that it becomes much easier for the policyholder to pick up that product.”

DoT directs telecom service providers to carry out Special Security Audit," Telecom players must do an audit of their network equipment on security grounds amid growing fears of data pilferage by Chinese companies, the government said in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
State-owned BSNL is heavily reliant on Chinese vendors for its equipment, according to data released by minister of state for communications Sanjay Dhotre in the Rajya Sabha. BSNL has procured 44.4 per cent of its mobile network equipment from ZTE and 9 per cent from Huawei, both Chinese companies. Fellow PSU, Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Limited, has procured 10 per cent of its equipment from the Chinese vendors.
“The DoT (department of telecommunications) has directed the telecom service providers i.e. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, Bharti Airtel Limited & Vodafone Idea Limited to carry out a Special Security Audit of their networks by an external agency,” the minister said.
The objective of the exercise is to check for any “backdoor” or “trapdoor” telecom network vulnerabilities that may allow foreign agencies to listen or collect data being shared on the network.

Vodafone, Airtel: Multiple vendors Under unified licence norms, each operator has to undertake an audit of their networks. “According to condition no 39.6 of Chapter VI of Unified Licence, each licensee has to undertake an audit of its network or get its network audited from a security point of view once in a financial year from a network audit and certification agency,” Dhotre said in response to a question from a lawmaker.
The minister’s comments come on the back of a security overhaul by the government where it has banned Chinese apps and has asked operators to complete their audits as well.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) has not deployed any equipment from ZTE and Huawei in its network, the minister said.
Vodafone Idea Limited  follows a multi-vendor strategy and has always been compliant with the various security-related requirements. Bharti Airtel Limited, too, follows a multi-vendor approach with equipment from Indian, American, European and Chinese companies across different domains such as radio, core and transport, Dhotre said in his reply.",business
Govt permits FDI of up to 74 per cent under automatic route in defence sector," The government has permitted foreign direct investment (FDI) of up to 74 per cent under the automatic route in the defence sector, according to a press note issued by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on Thursday.
However, the investments would be subject to scrutiny on the grounds of national security. The government shall reserve the right to review any foreign investment in the sector that affects or may affect national security, the DPIIT said in the note.
Under the current FDI policy, 100 per cent overseas investments are permitted in the defence industry — 49 per cent under the automatic route — while beyond that government approval is required.  What is FDI under automatic route?
Investments that do not require government or RBI approval.FDI in defence up to 49% at present under automatic route
What is the rule change?
Henceforth, FDI in defence up to 74% will not require any approval. Above 74%, approval will be required According to the Press Note 4 (2020 series): “FDI up to 74 per cent under the automatic route shall be permitted for companies seeking new industrial licences”.
The Press Note said infusion of fresh investments up to 49 per cent in a company not seeking industrial licence or which already has government approval for FDI in defence shall require “mandatory” submission of a declaration with the defence ministry in case of change in equity/shareholding pattern or transfer of stake by the existing investor to a new foreign investor for FDI up to 49 per cent, within 30 days of such a change”.

India ranks 116 on human capital index," India has been ranked at the 116th position in the latest edition of the World Bank’s annual Human Capital Index that benchmarks key components of human capital across countries. 
However, India’s score increased to 0.49 from 0.44 in 2018, according to the Human Capital Index report released by the World Bank on Wednesday.  The 2020 Human Capital Index update includes health and education data for 174 countries — covering 98 per cent of the world’s population — up to March 2020, providing a pre-pandemic baseline on the health and education of children, with the biggest strides made in low-income countries.

The analysis shows that pre-pandemic, most countries had made steady progress in building human capital of children, with the biggest strides made in low-income countries. Despite this progress, and even before the effects of the pandemic, a child born in a typical country could expect to achieve just 56 per cent of their potential human capital.

Shapoorji Pallonji threatens to file for unquantified damages against Tatas," The cash-strapped Shapoorji Pallonji group has threatened to file for unquantified damages against the Tatas for wrecking its fund-raising plans that has been built on the pledge of a small portion of the 18.4 per cent stake held in Tata Sons.
In a legal notice sent two days ago, the Cyrus Mistry camp has questioned the complicity of the $111-billion Tata group’s holding company and the members of its board of directors, individually and collectively, for seeking to block the Mistry family from raising funds against the security of the Tata Sons shares that they own.
The latest battle between the Tatas and the Mistry camp erupted after the Shapoorji Pallonji group entities signed a deal with Brookfield — a marquee Canadian investment firm — to raise Rs 3,750 crore as part of the first tranche of its fund raising plans. The group is hoping to raise Rs 11,000 crore to tide over an acute funds crunch precipitated by the pandemic.
The Tatas immediately approached the Supreme Court on September 5 seeking to restrain the Mistry group from raising capital against their Tata Sons shares. Through the petition, the Tatas sought to prevent the SP Group from creating any direct or indirect pledge of shares.
The Mistry camp has asked the group to respond to its notice “within three working days” of receiving the notice, failing which they will initiate action to stop the Tatas from once again trying to oppress a minority shareholder with a vindictive desire to harm its financial interests.

The notice said the company and its directors had been rendered “liable for damages, apart from being responsible for aiding, abetting and fomenting vexatious litigation without basis, and thereby putting at risk the lives and employment of tens of thousands of Indians in dire times of pandemic-induced socio-economic stress”.
The Mistry camp sought an explanation from the board members, particularly the independent directors, whether the oppressive action that causes prejudice to a minority shareholder was with their concurrence. An SP Group spokesperson stated that this move was solely intended to inflict irreparable harm on the group.
The notice accused the Tatas of seeking to create panic among the lenders to the SP Group entities. “The real objective was to spread panic among lenders and financial institutions and cause our clients colossal damage,” the notice said.
It added that the malafide intent was borne out by the fact that after filing an “urgent application” before the Supreme Court and seeking to be heard immediately, the Tatas had started to employ dilatory tactics.
“Now the urgency has miraculously evaporated and the application itself has been purportedly kept pending for curing defects,” the Mistry notice said. 
“Abusing the process of a court, no less than the Supreme Court of India, underlines such malafide conduct you have indulged in,” the notice added.
It accused Tata Sons and its board of directors of having acted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the company and its shareholders “especially when the outcome of such a move will also have serious implications on every company in the Tata Group that holds shares in Noticee No 1 (Tata Sons), and the encumbrances they or their shareholders may create from time to time”.
It accused the independent directors of failing in their statutory duty to “protect the minority shareholders and have acted as a mere rubber stamp to implement the majority shareholders’ decision without weighing its consequences on minority shareholders”.
“We have no comment to offer,” a Tata Sons spokesperson told PTI.",business

Airlines seek $1.5bn interest-free credit," Airlines in India have sought at least $1.5-billion in interest-free credit from the government. The Covid-19 related lockdowns and restrictions have dragged their revenues down 86 per cent in the first quarter to Rs 3,651 crore from a year ago, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Wednesday.
The carriers have also sought a deferment of loan repayments by six months without these borrowings being classified as “non-performing”, Puri said in a written reply to Parliament.
The airlines have asked the government to include jet fuel in the Goods and Services Tax and abolish excise duty on aviation turbine fuel, the minister said.
Indian carriers need as much as $2.5 billion to keep flying, according to estimates by CAPA Centre for Aviation; and one or more of the country’s airlines are expected to fail in the absence of additional funding from the government or their owners.
“The revenue of Indian carriers has reduced from Rs 25,517 crore during April-June 2019 to Rs 3,651 crore in the same period in 2020. The revenue of airport operators has decreased to Rs 894 crore from Rs 5,745 crore during April-June 2019,” the minister said.

The employee count of Indian carriers went down to 69,589 on July 31 from 74,887 on March 31, a decrease of 7.07 per cent. The employee count at airports has come down to 64,514 on July 31 from 67,760 on March 31. The number of employees at ground handling agencies fell 22.44 per cent to 29,254 in the April-July period.
Air India’s total revenue has come down to Rs 1,531 crore during the first quarter of 2020-21 from Rs 7,066 crore during April-June 2019.
Scheduled domestic flight services were suspended in India from March 25 to May 24 because of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. They were resumed from May 25 but in a curtailed manner.
Puri stated the domestic air traffic in the country fell to 1.2 crore during March-July period compared with 5.85 crore in the year-ago period. International traffic dropped to 11.55 lakh during these five months compared with  93.45 lakh in the year-ago period, he added.

Power draft rules placed in public domain for suggestions," The government has for the first time attempted to enumerate the rights of power consumers. A set of draft rules, placed in public domain for comment, propose strict timelines for the provision of electricity connections, enjoin power distribution companies to provide smart prepayment meters and pay compensation to consumers if they stumble on performance parameters.
The “Union power ministry in a historic pro-consumer move drafts Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020; invites suggestions/comments by September 30, 2020”, the ministry said in a statement.
The objective is to provide consumers better services and facilities, it said, adding that electricity consumers are the most important stakeholders in the power sector.
According to the draft rules, state electricity regulators will have to notify updated “standards of performance” for discoms and specify the compensation amounts that consumers would receive if the standards are not met. 
The parameters for which consumers would be eligible for compensation include unsatisfactory supply duration, number of power cuts and the time taken by discoms to provide new connections and replace defective meters.
The draft rules also entitle consumers to get rebates on power bills not served on time and other compensation from discoms if they fail to address grievances in a timely manner.
The draft said a distribution licensee shall supply 24x7 power to all consumers. The Electricity Commission, however,  may specify lower hours of supply for some category of consumers such as agriculture. New connections must be provided within seven days in metro cities, 15 days in other municipal areas and 30 days in rural areas.
Under the draft rules, no connection will be provided without a meter; most often it will be a smart pre-payment meter. Consumer shall be given the option to purchase the meter and associated equipment. 
The meter shall be read at least once in every billing cycle. In the case of smart pre-payment meters, the meters shall be read remotely at least once a month.
A bill amount of more than Rs 1,000 must be mandatorily paid online. There will be suitable rebates for online payments, it said.",business
Safety focus in mobility choice in post-Covid times," Indian consumers would prefer to travel in their own vehicles instead of public transport in a post-Covid world. About 73 per cent of the respondents of a survey conducted by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) and Grant Thornton India titled “Personal mobility experience post Covid-19” said they would buy a new vehicle once the economy slowly revives.
While 29 per cent of the respondents planned to purchase a new vehicle over a period of 12 months, 8 per cent were eager to buy one in the next six months. More than 56 per cent of participants feel it makes better financial sense to keep their current vehicle considering the overall economic scenario at present.
Rajesh Menon, director-general of SIAM, said, “The survey revealed two clear trends. While most consumers are preferring personal mobility over public and shared transportation, the slowing economy and its adverse impacts will continue to remain a cause of worry for consumers when it comes to making new purchases. However, because of safety concerns in the wake of the pandemic, customers who were earlier not considering buying vehicles, have also become potential buyers now.”
Respondents also showed a preference towards two wheelers and electric vehicles, accounting for around 20 per cent each.",business
Flipkart overseas IPO bid in early 2021," Walmart-controlled Flipkart is preparing for an initial public offering overseas as early as 2021, which could value the firm up to $50 billion, sources familiar with the company’s plans told Reuters.
Bangalore-based Flipkart, which vies with players such as Amazon.com’s local unit in India and India’s Reliance Industries, will be aiming for a valuation in the $45-50 billion range, according to one source with knowledge of the matter.
If achieved, that would mean Walmart would have more than doubled its investment.
Flipkart is likely to choose between Singapore, or the United States for the initial public offering (IPO), said two other sources, who asked not to be named as discussions are private.
“Flipkart is incorporated in Singapore, but listing in the United States, where parent Walmart is based, could give it access to a deeper pool of funds,” one of the sources said.
Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The sources said the preparations and discussions have been largely internal for now, but the company is preparing to tap external advisers on the process soon.
The discussions come as India drafts new regulations that could pave the way for domestic companies to directly list overseas.
Two other sources familiar with the plans said that work has begun to ensure compliance, legal and finance functions will meet regulatory standards ahead of a potential listing.
“Right now, the IPO target is more or less considered to be late 2021, or early 2022, but the current crisis has made things a little blurry,” said one of these two sources.
The second person added that being “IPO ready” has become a constant refrain in top level meetings internally. Walmart acquired a roughly 77 per cent stake in Flipkart for about $16 billion back in 2018. That deal remains the single largest foreign direct investment in India.
It turned Flipkart’s founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal into billionaires, and confirmed Flipkart’s status as the country’s most successful start-up at the time.
Later that year, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart in a regulatory filing said it could take Flipkart public in four years.
In July this year, Flipkart raised $1.2 billion in fresh funding with Walmart as its lead investor.
That round valued Flipkart, which counts China’s Tencent, US hedge fund Tiger Global, and Microsoft among its investors, at $24.9 billion.
Flipkart said it would use the funds, to be received in two tranches this fiscal year, to support the development of its e-commerce marketplace as India emerges from the Covid-19 crisis.
Like its rival Amazon, Flipkart began by selling books, but diversified rapidly into selling smartphones, clothing and other items. It now competes with Amazon in most categories.
India’s e-commerce sector is expected to be worth $99 billion by 2024, according to Goldman Sachs, as more Indians switch to online shopping.
That expanding market has attracted not only global giants such as Walmart and Amazon, but also India’s oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance, which has jumped into the fray. ",business
Vedanta wins arbitration case involving government," A judgment of a Malaysian tribunal was considered as valid by the Supreme Court in a case involving the government of India and some Indian parties.
The apex court on Wednesday squashed the government’s claim that the award by the Malaysian arbitration was not valid as it was against “public policy”.
The tribunal had awarded $476 million to Vedanta Limited (formerly Cairn India Ltd.),  Ravva Oil, Singapore and Videocon Industries towards contract charges for exploration of oil and gas on the Ravva oil fields, while the government claimed they were entitled to $198 million. 
The Union government had pleaded that in terms of the original production sharing contract (PSC) entered between the government and the private companies in October 1994, the latter were entitled to only $198 million. The Ravva fields are located off the Odisha coast.
However, a Malaysian arbitration tribunal in 2011 had ruled that the Indian government had to pay around $476 million. The decision was subsequently upheld by the Malaysian High Court and the Court of Appeal in that country. Thus all the three forums had rejected the Indian government’s plea.

Aggrieved, the Centre had appealed in the Delhi high court challenging the award. However, the Delhi high court too in this year dismissed the government’s appeal, following which the Centre appealed in the apex court. A three-judge bench of Justices Abdul Nazeer, Indu Malhotra and Aniruuddha Bose refused to interfere with the award, saying there was nothing on record to prove that the award was contrary to “public policy” as argued by India.
“The Award is not contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, or in conflict with the notions of justice, as discussed hereinabove. The term of the PSC was for a period of 25 years from October 28, 1994, which ended on October 27, 2019. 
“We have been informed that the term of the PSC has since been extended for a further period of 10 years, through the mutual agreement between the parties. This itself would reflect that the performance of the obligations under the PSC were not contrary to the interests of India,” the apex court said.",business
RBI holds out early rate cut hope," RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said that the central bank was “battle ready’’ to crank up the economy as he gave priority to growth over inflation, which has been well above the tolerance level.
Das said the RBI was prepared to take whatever measures to revive the economy, which contracted at a shocking 23.9 per cent in the April-June quarter, even as retail inflation at 6.69 per cent in August remained above the medium-term target of 4 per cent  plus or minus 2 per cent for the for the fifth straight month. 
At its meeting last month, the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the RBI had left the policy repo rate unchanged because of concerns over inflation.

However, high frequency indicators such as  agricultural activity, the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for manufacturing and private estimates of unemployment point to some stabilisation in the second quarter  amid several sectors reporting easing in contraction.
But at the same time, the recovery is not yet fully entrenched and in some sectors, the uptick seen in June and July is easing. “By all indications, the recovery is likely to be gradual as efforts towards the reopening of the economy are confronted with rising infections,” Das said.
The RBI governor said the immediate policy response was to focus on stabilisation along with quick recovery policies in the medium term.
Ficci chairperson Sunita Reddy said the private sector was afraid of getting crowded out of the loan market as the government could increase borrowing because of the poor state of its finances. The Centre has announced a record borrowing of Rs 12 lakh crore for this fiscal.
Das allayed Reddy’s fears as the borrowing costs in the economy were at their lowest levels in a decade. 
“Despite substantial increase in government borrowing programme, large surplus liquidity conditions has facilitated non-disruptive mobilisation of resources at the lowest borrowing costs in a decade, the RBI governor said. 
Moreover, Das said that benign financing conditions and the substantial narrowing of spreads have spurred a record issuance of corporate bonds of close to Rs 3.2 lakh crore during 2020-21 up to August.  Commenting on its one-time restructuring scheme, Das said that the interests of depositors and financial stability were kept in mind while framing the mechanism.
“The primary concern of any banking system should be the protection of the depositors’ interest... so, on the one hand we had to keep in mind the interest of the depositors, the need to maintain financial stability, the stability of the banking sector as we don’t want a repeat of the situation which India experienced a few years ago where the NPA levels of banks had gone up very steeply,” he said.
At the meeting, the RBI governor told the industry leaders to focus on five areas which would sustain India’s growth in the medium-run. 
These included human capital, in particular education and health, productivity, exports, which is linked to raising India’s role in the global value chain, tourism and food processing. In a bid to protect the interest of depositors, the Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Banking Regulation Act to bring cooperative banks under the supervision of the RBI.  
The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020 replaces an ordinance that was promulgated on June 26.  
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the legislation was designed to protect depositors’ funds and would not undermine the powers of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The powers of the registrar have not been encroached upon but the banking activity of co-operatives will be regulated by the RBI, she said. ",business
"RBI 'battle ready' to kick-start growth, says Shaktikanta Das"," RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said economic recovery is still not well entrenched and that the central bank is ""battle ready"" to take appropriate measures to support growth.
Addressing a virtual conference organised by industry body Ficci, Das said that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data released by the government was a ""reflection of the ravages of the Covid-19"".
The economy contracted 23.9 per cent during the April-June quarter on account of the strict lockdown imposed by the government towards end of March to check the spread of coronavirus infections.
""Nevertheless, high frequency indicators of agricultural activity, the purchasing managers' index that is PMI for manufacturing and certain private estimates on unemployment point to some stabilisation of economic activity in the second quarter of the current year, while of course contractions in several other sectors are also simultaneously easing,"" he said.
However, Das said that the economic recovery was not yet fully entrenched and also that the recovery is likely to be gradual.

""The recovery is, however, not yet fully entrenched and moreover, in some sectors, the uptick, which was noticed in June and July they appear to have levelled off. By all indications the recovery is likely to be gradual as efforts towards the reopening of the economy are confronted with rising infections,"" he said.
At the same time, Das assured the industry that the RBI stands ""battle ready"" and whatever measures are required will be taken to support liquidity, growth and control price rise.
According to him, the immediate policy response to Covid-19 in the country has been to prioritise the stabilisation of the economy and support quick recovery policies for durable and sustainable high growth in the medium term post the coronavirus.
The Governor also said financial market conditions in India have eased significantly across segments in response to the front-loaded cuts in the policy repo rate and large system-wide as well as targeted infusion of liquidity by the central bank.
""We are also very carefully monitoring the markets. As and when required further measures will be taken. I even said it earlier during my statements that the RBI stands fully prepared... I had used the terminology that the RBI stands battle ready and whatever measures are required will be taken up by the RBI,"" he said.
Despite substantial increase in the borrowing programme of the government, Das said that persistently large surplus liquidity conditions have ensured non-disruptive mobilisation of resources at the lowest borrowing costs in a decade.
Currently, government paper borrowing rates are the lowest in the last 10 years, he added.
Moreover, Das said that benign financing conditions and the substantial narrowing of spreads have spurred a record issuance of corporate bonds of close to Rs 3.2 lakh crore during 2020-21 up to August.
Noting that fragility of NBFCs is a concern, Das said the RBI is regularly monitoring the health of top 100 NBFCs and it would be the endeavour of the central bank that no large institution should fail.
Prior to the IL&FS crisis, Das said there were light touch regulations for the NBFC sector and the RBI is now trying to bring the regulations at par with banks so that there is no repeat of failure.
Regarding loan restructuring scheme, the RBI chief said he would look into the suggestions of the industry.
Interests of depositors and financial stability were kept in mind while framing the loan restructuring scheme, he said, adding that it had to be careful and a balanced decision on the part of the RBI.
""The primary concern of any banking system should be the protection of the depositors' interests because ultimately it is the depositors' money.
""... so, on the one hand we had to keep in mind the interest of the depositors, the need to maintain financial stability, the stability of the banking sector as we don't want a repeat of the situation which India experienced a few years ago where the NPA levels of banks had gone up very steeply,"" he said.
On the other hand, Das said, ""we are also equally mindful of the fact that Covid-19 has substantially affected a large number of businesses and particularly businesses that have availed loans from the banks. Therefore, they also needed some relief"".
The emphasis of resolution plan is to enable companies facing cash problem due to Covid-19 crisis to come back to normalcy and resume their activities, he noted.
""So both the sides had to be matched. In fact, the revival of businesses would also ensure that the NPA levels are kept low and it will also ensure a quicker economic recovery,"" he said.
Describing the New Education Policy 2020 (NEP) as a historic and much needed new age reform, he said it has the potential to leverage India's favourable demographics by prioritising human capital and that the goal to increase public investment in the education sector to 6 per cent of GDP must be pursued vigorously.
It is important to recognise that investment in education pays by raising average wages, he said, adding that higher education also contributes to economic development through greater sensitivity to environment/ climate change, energy use, civic participation and healthy lifestyle.
""While laudable crisis time response to scale up health infrastructure has helped in dealing with the health emergency, a more comprehensive approach similar to NEP for the health sector may be warranted, which must also cover deeper penetration of insurance, given the high burden of out of pocket expenses in India, and also preventive care,"" he said.
Noting that India's participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs) has been lower than many emerging and developing economies, he said there is need to tap this potential segment for bolstering global trade and growth.
A sharp policy focus on other GVC intensive ""network products"", including equipment for IT hardware, electrical appliances, electronics and telecommunications, and automobiles would also provide the cutting edge to India's export strategy with considerable scope for higher value additions, he added.
Terming tourism as an engine of growth, the RBI Governor said although the sector is severely impacted by Covid-19, this is a sector where pent up demand could drive a V shaped recovery when the situation normalises.
He also said the Covid-19 has brought the importance of food security and food distribution or supply chain network to the forefront of public policy debate in India.",business
Tax break for start-ups likely," Start-ups are likely to get a major tax break with the parliamentary standing committee of finance recommending that the tax on long term capital gains be abolished by at least two years for all investments funnelled through collective investment vehicles (CIVs) such as angel funds, alternative investment funds (AIFs) and investment limited liability partnerships (LLPs).
“At a minimum, this should be done for at least the next two years to encourage investments during the pandemic period,” the committee said in a report posted on the Lok Sabha website. “After this two year period, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) may be applied to CIVs so that revenue neutrality is maintained.”
The committee noted that Investments by CIVs are transparently done and have to be done at fair market value. Thus, it is easy to calculate the STT associated with these investments.
This can be done in lieu of imposing the long-term capital gains tax on these CIVs “to make the taxation system fairer, less cumbersome, and transparent,” the committee added. “This will also ensure that investments in unlisted securities are on a par with investments in listed securities.”
STT is imposed at 0.1 per cent of the value of listed shares traded on exchanges. The panel said that unicorns —startups with over $1 billion valuation — need to be scaled up, and the source for their capital-raising should be Indian as against current source of US and Chinese funds.

India has about 50 ‘unicorns’ that are now worth more than $500 billion collectively, and are leaders in the IT services, telecom, financial services, airline, e-commerce, and retailing industries, according to the report. The committee felt that the current law governing the taxation of long-term capital gains is “highly complex” due to varying tax treatment of income from capital gains based on varied parameters such as holding, tax rates that range from 10 per cent to 40 per cent and allows indexation only in respect of certain assets.
It said the capital gains tax rates for investment in unlisted shares by domestic investors can range from 28.49 per cent  to 42.74 per cent. The complex tax regime dampens the enthusiasm of investors in the private equity (PE)/venture capital (VC) that are eyeing Indian investments.
It said there was a need to incentivise large PE/VC funds to invest in the private sector and provide necessary capital to cash crunched companies.
The report said that in various developed jurisdictions such as the US, the UK and other EU, capital gains earned by foreign investors are not taxed. Closer to home, countries such as Singapore do not have any capital gains tax, which attracts investors to pool/ invest in Singapore, the report added.
The recommendation comes at a time when the Modi government amended its FDI policy by deciding to clamp down on investments in Indian companies through Chinese investors by subjecting them to rigorous scrutiny.",business
WTO rap on US tariffs," The World Trade Organisation said on Tuesday that the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese goods totaling more than $200 billion are illegal under the rules of the global trade body.
The decision marks the first time the Geneva-based trade body has ruled against a series of tariffs that President Donald Trump’s government has imposed on a number of countries, allies and rivals alike. Trump has repeatedly criticised the WTO, which oversees international disputes on trade, for allegedly treating the US unfairly.
In its decision, the WTO ruled against the Trump administration’s argument that China has engaged in practices harmful to US interests, on issues including intellectual property theft, technology transfer and innovation.
The ruling, in theory, would allow China to impose retaliatory tariffs on billions worth of US goods — if the process is completed. But the US government can appeal the decision announced by the WTO’s dispute settlement body, and the WTO’s appeals court is currently no longer functioning — largely because of Washington’s single-handed refusal to accept new members for it.
The US tariffs target two batches of Chinese products. Duties of 10 per cent were imposed on some $200 billion worth of goods in September 2018, and were jacked up to 25 per cent eight months later. AP

Exide shifts strategy," Automotive and industrial battery major Exide sees a better opportunity in the lithium ion sector amid the ongoing economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions, with many of its existing clients reviewing their sourcing strategy from China.
The company’s managing director and CEO Gautam Chatterjee informed shareholders at the annual general meeting on Tuesday that Exide will benefit from an early mover approach through its joint venture with Swiss firm Leclanche.
“The JV is well placed with an assembly line of 1.5 GWh capacity to take a leading position in the lithium ion battery market in India. Production lines have been ordered for battery pack assembly of cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cells, with some of them already in operations. Many pilot orders have been collected from multiple automotive OEMs, as well as large telecom operators, UPS manufacturers and solar PV companies,” Chatterjee said.

He added that the existing infrastructure will give an edge as demand for lithium ion cells picks up in the country in a phased manner. The lockdown has taken a toll on the business with automobile sales being subdued. The company has decided not to undertake any major capital expenditure, including planning any greenfield expansion in the near future. However, Chatterjee said that brownfield expansions will be under consideration.

Max buyback bonanza," Max India on Tuesday said it would come out with a capital reduction programme under which the company would buy back equity shares worth up to Rs 92 crore from the public.
The company plans to offer its shareholders the option of taking Rs 85 per share for up to 20 per cent of their equity in lieu of cancelling the shares. The shares of Max India rallied more than 8 per cent to close at Rs 67.05 on the BSE after the announcement. The buyback price translates to a 37 per cent premium to the closing price of the Max India scrip on Monday.
Max India, which got relisted on the bourses on August 28, said it had Rs 400 crore in its kitty primarily from the divestment of its erstwhile subsidiary Max Bupa.
Max wants to use up to Rs 92 crore of the sum for capital reduction, while the balance of more than Rs 300 crore will be apportioned for growth and other operational expenses.
“The board has approved the capital reduction exercise. The proposal will need to be approved by a special resolution of public shareholders. It will additionally need regulatory approvals including from stock market regulator and NCLT, Mumbai. The approval process is expected to take about 6-8 months,” Max India said.

Goodricke meets goals," Premium tea maker Goodricke on Tuesday said that uprooting and replantation exercise is a continuous process for the company and the average age of bushes is less than 50 years.
Speaking at the AGM, Goodricke MD & CEO Atul Asthana said that due to modernisation and replantation, the company had been able to meet the production shortfall as the entire workforce was not available due to the pandemic.

Apple subscriptions in a bundle," Apple Inc rolled out a new virtual fitness service and a bundle of all its subscriptions, Apple One, focusing a holiday-season product launch on services that are the backbone of Apple’s growth strategy and cater to customers working at home during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Apple also introduced a new Apple Watch Series 6 that monitors blood oxygen and will cost $399, and a lower-cost Apple Watch SE for $279.
The Apple One bundle will cost $15 per month for an individual plan or $20 per month for a family plan and include television, music and games. Apple is also offering a bundle for $30 per month that adds news, the fitness service and more storage.
Apple said both new watches can be pre-ordered starting Tuesday and will be available on Friday. Apple also introduced the Apple Fitness+ service, powered by its watches, that will deliver virtual workouts for $10 per month or $80 per year and be available before the end of the year.
Shares of exercise stationary bike maker Peloton Interactive Inc, which also has a subscription service, were up about 3.6 per cent after Apple’s announcement.
Apple said that most of its workouts were designed to be conducted with either no equipment or minimal gear such as a set of dumbbells, whereas Peloton’s workouts typically require either a bike or a treadmill.
The ability of the Apple Watch to monitor blood oxygen seeks to match a similar feature already available on watches from rival Fitbit Inc, which Alphabet Inc’s Google is buying for $2.1 billion.
Apple added a faster chip to its base model iPad, which it priced at $329 for consumers and $299 for education customers. Apple’s new iPad Air will cost $599 and look more like its iPad Pro models and a new A14 processor chip that Apple says will be the first to use a 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process.
Apple’s biggest seller — the iPhone —is expected to be announced next month after executives have said its launch will be delayed by several weeks because of pandemic-related disruptions.
Apple shares have soared this year even as the virus has crippled economies around the world, thanks in large part to booming sales of work-from-home items.",business
SAIL slips into the red," Domestic steel major SAIL has suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 1,226.47 crore for the June quarter of 2020, mainly on account of reduced income.

Consequently, the company’s manufacturing operations had to be scaled down during the said quarter.
“Though the operations resumed in the later part of the quarter with limited availability of workforce and disrupted supply chain, the restrictions imposed adversely impacted the sales volume and realisation,” SAIL said. Budget carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday reported a first-quarter net loss of Rs 600.5 crore owing to the suspension of flight operations because of the coronavirus-induced lockdown. It had posted a net profit of Rs 262.8 crore a year ago.

"Toyota in Rs 2,000cr investment flip-flop"," Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) on Tuesday found out that investment plainspeak could land a company into a political pothole in the country. Some hours after threatening to stop expansion because of the Modi-government’s  lopsided taxation , the auto giant did a U-turn to keep the political hounds at bay.
The Japanese car maker announced an investment of Rs 2,000 crore over the next 12 months after a senior official of the company had said it would stop all expansion in India on account of high taxes
 The announcement on investment was made by TKM vice-chairman Vikram Kirloskar, whose company, Kirloskar Systems Limited, holds 11 per cent in TKM.
Earlier in the day, TKM vice-chairman and whole time director Shekhar Vishwanathan had in an interview to Bloomberg said the company would halt all expansion in view of the prevailing high taxes on cars. He had stated that the “central government keeps taxes on cars and motorbikes so high that companies find it hard to scale”.
It also makes car-owning out of reach for many consumers which translates into idle factories and less jobs. “The message we are getting after we have come here and invested, is that we don’t want you,” Vishwanathan has been quoted as saying.
All it then took was a tweet by heavy industries minister Prakash Javadekar. “The news that Toyota Company will stop investing in India is incorrect. vikramkirloskar has clarified that Toyota will invest more than Rs 2,000 crore in next 12 months,” the minister said in his tweet.
Endorsing Javadekar, Kirloskar tweeted: “Absolutely! We are investing 2000+ crs in electric components and technology for the domestic customer and export. We are committed to the future of India.”
Sandwiched between Vishwanathan’s assessment and the late evening climbdown, the company had put out a statement saying it would first try to “achieve full capacity utilisation which will take time”.",business
States may go to court for GST dues," Opposition-ruled states may go to court if the Centre is able to rustle up support in the GST Council to the “disagreeable” option of forcing the state governments to raise borrowings from the market to fill up the shortfall in the GST collections which is estimated at Rs 3 lakh crore this fiscal.
The shortfall — which the Centre is obligated to compensate the states for a period of five years till 2022 — should have come out of the proceeds of a compensation cess that is levied on a handful of luxury and other demerit goods.
But the cess isn’t likely to yield more than Rs 65,000 crore this year which leaves a yawning gap of Rs 2.35 lakh crore. The Centre has refused to fork out this sum. Instead, it has cleverly diced this sum up into two components: a sum of Rs 97,000 crore which it has arbitrarily attributed to the infirmities in GST implementation and a larger Rs 1.38 lakh crore that has been ascribed to the Covid-19 pandemic and treated as an exogenous factor outside the scope of the GST regime.
States have been given the option of either borrowing a sum of Rs 97,000 crore through a special loan window to be created by the RBI or the entire sum of Rs 2.65 lakh crore at market rates.
Most BJP-ruled states have weighed in favour of the first option and the proposal is likely to be carried at the GST Council meet this Saturday. The Centre has a one-third weightage in any Council vote which fairly secures the outcome.

At least one state, Bengal, has not ruled out the possibility to challenge the Centre’s sinister plan to shake off its obligations under the GST which was critical in securing the states’ support for a contentious tax reform that required them to subsume virtually all their taxes and levies under an overarching tax system designed to create a pan-India common market.
“Whether we will go to court or not is a strategy I can’t reveal,” Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra told Karan Thapar in an interview for news portal The Wire.
Even though Mitra had always insisted that trust and consensus had been the guiding lights for ushering GST in the country, seeking the view of the attorney-general of India on GST compensation may have changed the equation.
Some believe the Centre has paved the way for legalese in the matter of GST when it buttressed its stand with the AG’s view in an attempt to wreck the spirit of cooperative federalism that underpinned the GST regime.
Bengal and several other non-BJP states want the Centre to borrow the entire shortfall. In return, they are okay with extension of cess collection period to pay for the principal and interest on the central loan.",business
Narendra Modi sows agri reforms," The Narendra Modi-government on Tuesday set the stage for big bang reforms in the farm sector when it secured the Lok Sabha’s approval for the first part of a three-stage legislative template with the passing of a bill to amend the 65-year-old Essential Commodities Act.
The farm sector reforms — which will allow the Big Boys of Business to storm the country’s farmlands and grab control over the distribution of farm produce — are designed to break the hegemony of the mandis, usher in contract farming in a big way, catalyse the creation of large cold chain storage facilities and logistic networks and shake off decades-old stockholding restrictions that were designed to ensure a pricing system that would be fair to both farmers and retail consumers at the end of a convoluted value chain.
The contours of the reform process were outlined in June when the Centre passed three ordinances that are now set to gain the imprimatur of Parliament through legislative amendments.
But the changes have already sparked an outcry from opposition MPs who worry that the system is now being gamed to help big business rather than the farmers who supposedly will get a fair price for their produce.
On Wednesday, the Lok Sabha is expected to debate the second piece of legislation — the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill — which seeks to give farmers the freedom to skirt the mandi system and sell their produce through alternative trading channels that the large retailing channels in the country hope to create.

Later, the House will also debate a proposal to allow big business to establish large contract farms, which many believe will threaten the livelihood of the small and marginal farmers who hold less than 2 hectares of land each and account for over 86 per cent of all the farmers in the country. The Modi-government’s farm sector reforms came under attack during the Lok Sabha debate with several opposition members dubbing it as a thinly-disguised plan to favour a few crony capitalists while professing to create a brave new world for farmers.
The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeks to deregulate food items, including cereals pulses and onion.
Trinamul Congress’ Saugata Roy and Kalyan Banerjee opposed the bill and accused the Centre of taking away the power of states. “I don't understand what was the hurry of bringing the ordinance,” Roy said and claimed the legislation will benefit big traders, while farmers would be left in the lurch. “It will give big corporates entry into the space of farmers.”
The Opposition cited to the provision that does away with stock limit unless prices shoot up to extra-ordinary levels.
Participating in the debate, Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, an ally of the ruling BJP, spoke about “misgivings” and “doubts” among farmers on the Bill and two other proposed legislations related to the farm sector.",business
Airbus warns of layoffs as air travel fails to recover," Airbus has stepped up warnings of compulsory layoffs as air travel fails to recover as quickly as expected from the coronavirus crisis, putting itself on a potential collision course with unions and the French government.
The warning in a letter to its 130,000 staff from Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, seen by Reuters, marks a more pessimistic tone from the planemaker, which had previously said only that it could not rule out compulsory measures.
“I owe it to you to be transparent: it’s unlikely that voluntary departures will be enough,” Faury wrote in the letter distributed on Friday evening.
Unions and the French government have urged the Toulouse-based planemaker to avoid compulsory layoffs as it sheds up to 15,000 posts to cope with plummeting travel demand.
Airbus has repeatedly warned that the outlook is uncertain as the industry’s worst crisis hits aircraft deliveries and severely weakens airline finances.
But a disappointing rise in air travel over the summer has cast a fresh pall over the company’s biggest ever restructuring plans.
“Unfortunately, the recovery in airline traffic over the summer period has not been at the level the industry was counting on,” Faury wrote.
“We must now prepare for a crisis that will probably be even deeper and longer than the previous scenarios suggested”.
The group representing most of the world’s airlines, the International Air Transport Association, said last week that air traffic had failed to recover as quickly as expected in July, a key part of the peak season for airline revenues. 
July traffic was down 80% compared with the same month of 2019, compared with a 94% drop at the low point in April. ",business
Nvidia buys British chip designer Arm from SoftBank," Nvidia said on Sunday that it would acquire the British chip designer Arm from SoftBank in a deal worth about $40 billion, a move that could reshape the battle over technology that powers smartphones and data centers.
Nvidia, best known for supplying chips that render images in video games, said it would pay SoftBank a combination of cash and shares in the transaction. Nvidia’s market capitalisation has skyrocketed to over $300 billion lately, partly owing to recent success in artificial intelligence applications and pandemic-fueled growth in chips used for PC gaming.
If completed, the transaction would instantly transform Nvidia into one of the most influential players in smartphone technology, a market that had previously eluded it. Arm, which licenses designs that other companies turn into chips, has long defined the computing technology found in most mobile devices. And Arm designs are starting to play a bigger role in cloud data centers.

But the deal is likely to prompt close scrutiny by antitrust authorities around the world.

Arm, which was acquired by SoftBank in 2016, is widely perceived as an independent entity that gives equal treatment to all licensees. Industry executives and analysts have pointed to potential conflicts if a company received technical assistance from an Nvidia-owned Arm that could give its own chip business unfair advantages over other licensees.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, pledged to keep operating Arm as it has been.
“Arm’s business model is brilliant,” he wrote in a letter to Nvidia employees on Sunday. “We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world.”
Nvidia also said it would keep operating Arm from Cambridge, England, and honour commitments SoftBank made to keep investing in Britain. Mr. Huang said he and Simon Segars, Arm’s chief executive, had already held initial talks with British officials, who were “delighted” with the company’s expansion plans.

McLeod Russel loss at Rs 90cr in first quarter," Bulk tea producer McLeod Russel India Ltd has suffered a first-quarter loss of Rs 90.52 crore compared with a loss of Rs 11.64 crore a year ago. 
The June quarter of last fiscal included an exceptional gain of Rs 90.70 crore.
Revenues stood at Rs 196.4 crore in the reporting quarter, down from Rs 245.83 crore as the nationwide lockdown disrupted tea plantation in April and partly in May. The crop loss has since created a shortage in the market, leading to tea prices going up and the company is expecting the next two quarters to be better.
The company, which is hoping for a resolution to its debt problem, acknowledged  that while operational performance has improved, the financial position continued to be under stress.

Bengal GST revenue contracts 35.9%," GST revenues of Bengal contracted 35.9 per cent to Rs 11,781 crore between April and August because of the Covid-induced lockdown, while the state is due Rs 7,750 crore in provisional compensation for the fiscal, according to data presented by minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur in the Lok Sabha on Monday.
The compensation due to states stands at over Rs 1.51 lakh crore, Thakur said.  
The provisional GST compensation due to states and Union territories for 2020-21 was highest for Maharashtra at Rs 22,485 crore, followed by Karnataka, Rs 13,763 crore and Uttar Pradesh, Rs 11,742 crore.
So far, 15 of the 31 states have opted for one of the two borrowing options proposed by the Centre which could pave the way for the proposal getting voted at the GST Council meeting on October 5.
States to have opted for the first option are Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Odisha. 
Manipur is the the sole state to go for second option.
States and Union territories that are not in favour of either of the two options are Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Telangana, Pondicherry, Kerala and West Bengal.
States have been given two options: either borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the shortfall arising due to GST implementation or  borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore which includes the Rs 1.38 lakh crore that the Centre has refused to pay as this is as attributed to Covid-related factors.",business
Infosys acquires Czech-based GuideVision," IT services major Infosys on Monday said it will acquire Czech Republic-based GuideVision for up to 30 million euros (about Rs 260.4 crore).

Retail prices ease in August," The country’s retail inflation slightly eased in August to 6.69 per cent as food prices fell, but remained above the upper limit of the RBI tolerance band of 6 per cent for the fifth straight month. Economists expect the central bank to press for another pause in policy action in the forthcoming policy.
Data released by the National Statistics Office on Monday showed food inflation eased in August to 9.05 per cent from 9.27 per cent in the preceding month.
Under the food segment, double digit inflation in case of eggs (10.1 per cent), oils and fats (12.4 per cent),  vegetables (11.4 per cent), pulses (14.4 per cent) and spices (12.3 per cent) continue to push food inflation higher. Inflation in case of fuel components rose to a five-month high of 3.1 per cent in August 2020 compared with 2.7 per cent in July 2020 and (-)1.7 per cent in August 2019. 
A low base effect and a rise in prices of diesel and kerosene has led to the uptick in this component from the previous month’s figures.
The government has revised downwards the retail inflation numbers for July to 6.73 per cent from the earlier estimates of 6.93 per cent.
“CPI inflation is expected to print sub-4 per cent only in December 2020-February 2021, based on which a continuation of the accommodative stance appears doubtful,” Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra said.
Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings, said: “MPC will keep this number at back of the mind when evaluating its decision in the next meeting. Inflation is well above 6 per cent while growth has slipped quite sharply. The liquidity situation is comfortable while bank credit growth has been negative. The decision may steer towards another pause in policy action.”
Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings, said: “Despite first-quarter  GDP contracting 23.9 per cent, we believe policy rates are unlikely to be cut in the forthcoming monetary policy.”
Data separately released by the industry department earlier in the day showed India’s wholesale price inflation turned positive in August after a gap of four months.
The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation stood at 0.16 per cent in August against a contraction of 0.58 per cent in July as inflation for the manufactured items accelerated to 1.27 per cent from 0.51 per cent during the same period. 
During August, crude oil prices softened 17.44 per cent from a year ago, while fuel prices eased by 9.7 per cent from their levels a year earlier.
The Reserve Bank of India has cut policy rates by 115 basis points so far this year, to 4 per cent. However, rising food inflation has pushed inflation higher than the upper band of the central bank's target range, forcing the RBI to put a pause in its rate cutting cycle.

Trai says no plan to regulate OTTs," The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Monday said there is no need to regulate over-the-top (OTT) communication services at the moment. 
The regulator said that the time is not opportune to recommend a comprehensive regulatory framework for various aspects of OTT services beyond the laws and regulations prescribed currently, and decided against any immediate regulatory intervention.
OTT services refer to applications and services that are accessible over the internet and ride on an operator’s network. Skype, Viber, WhatsApp and Hike are some of the popular OTT services.
The department of telecommunications had in March 2016 sought the recommendations of Trai on net neutrality and other related aspects such as economic, security and privacy issues, and regulatory framework for OTT services similar to services provided by telecom service providers. Trai had subsequently come out with a discussion paper on regulatory framework for OTT services in November 2018 where it had sought the industry’s views on multiple issues.
Releasing its recommendations on the regulatory framework for OTT communication services, Trai said the matter can be looked into afresh when more clarity emerges in international jurisdictions, particularly the study undertaken by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union). It added that no regulatory interventions are needed for privacy and security related issues of OTT services for now.
“It is not an opportune moment to recommend a comprehensive regulatory framework for various aspects of services referred to as OTT services, beyond the extant laws and regulations prescribed at present,” Trai said in a statement.
The authority added that market forces may be allowed to respond to the situation without prescribing any regulatory intervention. “However, developments shall be monitored and intervention as felt necessary shall be done at appropriate time,’’ it said.
Telecom companies in India had long been demanding that OTT players be brought under the ambit of the regulatory framework as they offer similar services without attached licensing obligations, conditions and levies (such as licence fee).",business
No plans of excise hike on cigarettes," The government has no plans to increase central excise duty on cigarettes, bidis and smokeless tobacco, Parliament was informed on Monday.
“The GST rates on goods, including compensation cess rates are fixed on the basis of the recommendations of the GST Council. As regards central excise duty, there is no proposal to increase duty at present,” Anurag Thakur, minister of state for finance, informed the Lok Sabha in a question.
The total tax collected under central excise and cess for Tobacco Products have increased from Rs 1,234 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 1,610 crore in 2019-20.

Centre to pour funds into PSU banks," The Modi-government on Monday sought Parliament approval for a Rs 20,000 crore bank recapitalisation programme for this fiscal but the out-of-budget proposal may not be enough given looming bad asset concerns and the difficulties faced by PSU banks to raise funds from the markets.
The lockdown has forced the government to do a U-turn on recapitalisation: in her budget speech in February, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had ruled out recapitalisation funds for banks as the government had already large sums in them over the past few years.
Amid the bad asset fears, the RBI prodded the Centre to go for a recap. In its stability report, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said recapitalisation had “become necessary” and called for lenders to raise money in advance to “build resilience” in the financial system.
“There are certain stress points in the financial system, which would require constant regulatory and policy attention to mitigate the risks. The economic impact of the pandemic may result in higher non-performing assets and capital erosion of banks. A recapitalisation plan for PSBs and private banks (PVBs) has, therefore, become necessary,” Das said. 
According to the RBI, the gross non-performing asset ratio of PSBs will increase to 15.2 per cent of advances by March 2021 from 11.3 per cent a year back “under the baseline scenario”.
Analysts said PSU banks may need capital to the tune of around Rs 60,000 crore in this fiscal alone, much in excess of the Rs 20,000 crore proposed in the budget.  
Banks will have to set aside more funds to provide for a possible rise in bad loans during the second half, the analysts said.
Experts, however, point out that much will depend on the one-time restructuring. The recast mechanism which was announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last month is expected to lower the capital needs of banks on account of lower slippages as banks restructure stressed assets.
Last month rating agency Icra had estimated that the capital requirements for the state owned lenders could decline to Rs 20,000-55,500 crore this year. It had earlier projected capital requirements for PSU banks at Rs 46,000-82,600 crore for 2020-21.
Rating agency CARE said the recap exercise was more likely to be undertaken through recap bonds rather than any budget expenditure as it does not come under the head of “cash outgo”. The rating egency did not rule out the possibility of the funds being raised through savings by other departments. 
“We need to see which of these options would hold here; and more likely it would be the first. This was not part of the budget and hence can be interpreted as being expended to cushion PSBs against the pandemic impact,” Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Care Ratings said.",business
Government borrowings may leap," The government on Monday sought Parliament approval for an additional gross expenditure of Rs 2.35 lakh crore with a net cash outgo of Rs 1.67 lakh crore. It aimed to shovel another Rs 40,000 crore into the rural jobs guarantee programme.
Officials have indicated government borrowing could be revised upwards and the bond market will have to deal with a higher supply of government paper in October-March as both the Centre and states will be strapped for cash — that will raise yields in the market.
The borrowing calendar for the second half of the fiscal will be finalised later this month.
The supplementary demands for grants said the net cash outgo will be Rs 1.66 lakh crore as the gross additional expenditure “matched by savings of the Ministries or Departments or by enhanced receipts or recoveries aggregates to Rs 68,868.33 crore”. 
The government has also sought Rs 46,602.43 crore towards providing additional allocation under Post Devolution Revenue Deficit Grant to the states following the recommendations of the Fifteenth Finance Commission.

The first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2020-21 includes 54 Grants and 1 Appropriations.
“The expenditures are part of the announcements made by the government as part of Covid relief and hence these demands are formalisation of the process of incurring these expenses,” according to Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Rating. 
“However, the state deficit grant appears to be outside these announcements and hence become additional expenditure. This amount would be around 0.23 per cent of GDP. 
“We believe that the others have already been buffered in our calculation of the fiscal deficit which we project now to be at around 8-8.5 per cent of GDP assuming marginal fall in nominal GDP from last year.”",business
Microsoft out as TikTok chooses Oracle as US tech partner," Satya Nadella-led Microsoft lost a bid to acquire TikTok in the US after the Chinese owner of the video-sharing platform chose Oracle to be its technology partner for its American operations, ahead of President Donald Trump’s  September 20 deadline to ban the popular app if it wasn't sold to an American company.
Microsoft said in a statement on Sunday that the Chinese owner of TikTok ByteDance has informed it that they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft"".
“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests. To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas,” Microsoft said.
A report in The New York Times said it was unclear whether TikTok choosing Oracle as a technology partner would mean that the multinational computer technology corporation would also take a majority ownership stake of the social media app.
The Wall Street Journal said in a report that Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok's trusted tech partner in the US, and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale.
The next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the US government, the WSJ report said.
In an executive order signed last month, Trump had said that TikTok would be blocked in the US if it did not sell its US operations to an American company by September 20. The Trump administration has said that TikTok and other Chinese apps are national security threats.
“But sale talks had been in a holding pattern because China issued new regulations last month that would bar TikTok from transferring its technology to a foreign buyer without explicit permission from the Chinese government. And any resulting deal could still be a geopolitical pinata between the United States and China,"" the NYT report said. The report added that the Chinese regulations helped scuttle the bid by Microsoft, which had said in August that it would insist on a series of protections that would essentially give it control of the computer code that TikTok uses for the American and many other English-speaking versions of the app.
Microsoft said the only way it could protect the privacy of TikTok users in the United States and prevent Beijing from using the app as a venue for disinformation was to take over that computer code, and the algorithms that determine what videos are seen by the 100 million Americans who use it each month, the NYT report said.
Oracle has not yet disclosed what it would do with TikTok's underlying technology, written by a Chinese engineering team in Beijing.
India was the first country to ban TikTok and WeChat, citing national security concerns. India has banned over 220 Chinese apps, a move welcomed by both the Trump administration and US lawmakers. As tensions between the US and China escalated, TikTok had become the flash point between Washington and Beijing over issues of technology and privacy concerns.
The Trump administration had already banned the Chinese telecom giant Huawei from selling 5G networks and equipment in the US, citing the risk of a foreign power controlling the infrastructure on which all internet communications flow.
Even if Oracle may try to close a deal, it is unclear whether Beijing would create new obstacles to the process. And election-year politics have hung over the negotiations from the start.
""Unlike many other technology companies, Oracle has cultivated close ties with the Trump administration. Its founder, Larry Ellison, hosted a fund-raiser for Mr Trump this year, and its chief executive, Safra Catz, served on the president's transition team and has frequently visited the White House, the NYT report said.
Last month, Trump had said he would support Oracle buying TikTok, calling Oracle a great company and said the firm, which specialises in enterprise software, could successfully run TikTok.
“I think that Oracle would certainly be somebody that could handle it,” Trump had said.
Trump has said that apps such as TikTok, WeChat and equipment maker Huawei pose a national security threat because data collected about users can be shared with the Communist Party-led Chinese government. The Chinese firms have denied this claim.
Two of ByteDance's largest backers, Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, have sought to retain their holdings in its valuable subsidiary while saving TikTok from a ban in the US. Both firms are represented on ByteDance's board of directors. In late August, the firms teamed up with Oracle to bid against Microsoft.
Microsoft, meanwhile, had teamed up with Walmart to make its bid.

Tips to build a robust financial immunity amid all the uncertainties," All of us have adapted to our own sanitisation routines to protect ourselves and our loved ones, especially in the face of the ongoing pandemic. We are not only realising the importance of physical and mental immunity, but are also learning new lessons in financial immunity. 
A survey by Swiss Re states that Covid-19 has significantly impacted financial stability with up to one out of three people feeling overwhelmed and anxious about their finances. The survey goes on to state that 68 per cent of the respondents felt that insurance helped to ease their stress and provide financial support during uncertain times, with 78 per cent saying their claims experience matched expectations.
Clearly, if you find yourself consumed with the thoughts of rising medical costs and overwhelming financial responsibilities, know that you are not alone. Here are a few financial tips which should help you to alleviate this anxiety and build a robust financial immunity.  It is common knowledge that increased levels of stress can lead to lowered physical and mental immunity. The key to maintaining a healthy immune system lies in the right lifestyle choices such as following a healthy diet and regular exercise. Similarly, the key to building financial immunity is by taking the right precautions towards protecting one’s finances and creating a financial cushion to safeguard oneself and the family from monetary stress, led by lifestyle disease or any unforeseen eventuality. 
Hence, the first step is to take care of oneself, ward off unwanted panic and deliberate on concrete steps to build financial immunity.  Families grow stronger and closer when they withstand challenges and adversities together. Therefore, it is important to stay closer to the people you love, who comfort you and who provide you the best advice related to life, finances etc. Spending time with your loved ones keeps anxiety and stress at bay and, thus, keeping physical immunity unaffected in the long run. Spending more time doing fun activities with family and friends gets one into a better frame of mind, leading to a better handling of any situation. Given the reboot of the larger economy, it is wise to revisit our saving patterns and prioritise expenses. The thumb rule for the success of any financial plan is to first safeguard against the uncertainties of life and health as these eventualities could potentially wipe out our savings of a lifetime. Address the shortcoming in your portfolio by diversifying with insurance and investment instruments; this way you can build the much-needed cushion of financial immunity for yourself and your family. While focusing on financial planning, it is imperative to always have a life insurance plan in the portfolio that offers both life cover and critical illnesses cover in a single product to safeguard the insured and the family from worries related to life and health. A dual protection plan will ensure the family tides through the tough time along with a monetary safety net. 
One can look for hybrid instruments that combine life cover with a critical illness cover as it provides financial assistance as a lump sum amount to take care of the treatment cost as well as loss of pay, if a critical illness is identified. In the current scenario, a dual protection insurance plan is a must in one’s portfolio as it offers a holistic protection cover.  It is indispensable to keep the nominee in the loop about the insurance policies that one holds, which needs to be done after the purchase of any insurance policy. By doing so, the family is aware of the policy bought and in the case of an unfortunate event, the nominee can claim the sum assured for which the insured has been making regular premium payments. 
It has been noticed in several cases that the insured has forgotten to keep the nominee informed, making their policies worth no more than a piece of paper in an exigency. Informing the nominee on the policies purchased helps the deceased family members to not rummage to find the policy information during emergencies. Remember, just like we are taking care of our health immunity, it is imperative that we pay equal attention to build a robust financial immunity to stay protected in uncertain times.

Banks seek risk cushion for start-ups," The banking sector is in favour of a risk cushion in the form of a structured credit guarantee mechanism specifically for start-ups to boost lending to the sector.
The RBI has revised the guidelines for priority sector lending, including start-ups, to prompt banks to start lending to the sector. 
Loans up to Rs 50 crore to start-ups engaged in agriculture and allied services as well as those that meet the definition of MSMEs are now part of priority sector lending.
Banks, while welcoming the inclusion of start-ups under the priority sector, have warned of multiple challenges that warrant a careful evaluation of the loan prospects keeping in mind the elevated risk in the current economic scenario. 
Inadequate collateral, uncertain future cash flow and inexperienced management are among the key risks that banks are wary of.
Moreover, there is a lack of clarity whether only recognised start-ups will be eligible to get credit under priority sector lending. According to government data, there are around 4.2 lakh start-ups in the country of which only 36,692 are recognised by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade.
“To boost lending to start-ups, it is imperative to set in place an institutional mechanism. For example, start-ups don’t have collateral and performance evaluation mechanism matrix.
Hence, it will be interesting to see how the lenders can diversify their risk appetite and lend to start-ups which do not meet the traditional requirements of security/collateral/cash flow. We believe a suitably structured guarantee scheme from the government could be useful in the current scenario to give impetus to lend to start-ups,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India.
Bankers said that a credit guarantee scheme like the one in place for MSMEs will encourage more banks to convert enquiries into actual borrowings. 
“With the inclusion of start-ups in priority sector lending, banks will be encouraged to give credit to the sector. A credit guarantee, similar to MSME-CGTMSE will be beneficial,” said Sudhakara Rao KS, general manager, MSME, of Indian Bank.
The deteriorating economic condition has also impacted start-ups, especially those lacking marquee investors with industry estimates suggesting 70 per cent of the start-ups in India have less than 3 months of cash available in their banks.
“Getting a start-up off the ground is not an easy task for any entrepreneur. Lack of adequate funding when required and high risk perception of the banks towards this segment has most often been the two major reasons why start-ups have found it difficult to even set up shops. The credit guarantee scheme has helped MSMEs so far and the same if applied to start-ups will surely be beneficial for them,” said Parthiv Neotia, director, Ambuja Neotia.
“A credit guarantee from start-ups may not potentially be anticipated from the Centre in a market reeling from the coronavirus induced lockdown. The move to assign priority sector status to start-ups may act as a serious boost for smaller entities in terms of funding and seeking credit. This makes available multiple funding options beyond angel investments and PE/VC funding,” said Arindam Sarkar, partner, Khaitan and Co.",business
Prospective EV buyers worry over costs," The upfront cost of electric vehicles (EV)s, battery replacement and the distance a vehicle can run on a single charge are the top concerns for people planning to buy EVs, according to a survey by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).
The potential of EVs to reduce pollution, carbon emissions and oil dependency in India has prompted the government to push for wider adoption of the technology.
According to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV), 3,400 electric cars and 1.52 lakh electric two-wheelers were sold in India in 2019-20. Total sales grew 20 per cent over the previous financial year. Yet the current EV penetration in India is low.
“We saw that there is a difference in the expectations of those who own an EV and those who do not. For example, EV owners do not assign much importance to the availability of the used car market and the vehicle’s resale value,” said Parmeet Singh, research associate, TERI. 
“The difference in perception of the two groups is directly related to the knowledge and experience of EVs. We also found that household income does not affect EV purchase decisions,” said Singh.
In the survey, 71 per cent of respondents under the age of 25 asked about the resale value of EVs. “These consumers are likely to procure a vehicle from the used car market because of their income level and the desire to replace an existing vehicle,” said Singh.
The survey also found that the ability of EVs to cover a limited distance in comparison to internal combustion engines had an impact on perception and highlighted an important concern. ",business
SBI Card offers its own recast plan," SBI Card is in the process of enrolling “delinquent” customers, who did not repay after the end of the moratorium, in the RBI restructuring scheme or its own repayment plan to provide them more time for repayments, a top company official has said.
A number of customers had not been paying for the first three months of the payment holiday and the company treated them as standard accounts in line with the entire industry. However, since then, as the first moratorium ended, SBI Card made it a customer-led enrolment in the second moratorium in which a lot of customers did not enrol, SBI Card managing director & CEO Ashwini Kumar Tewari said. 
“Therefore, we had a large chunk of customers who came out of the moratorium. A lot of them paid up but many of them did not pay also. And these became what we call as more delinquent customers.

“So with these delinquent customers, we are now working to enrol them either into the RBI restructuring scheme or our own repayment plans so that they get more time and a better interest rate to pay their dues,” Tewari, who took charge over a month ago, said. 
According to the company, it had Rs 7,083 crore under moratorium in May, which came down to Rs 1,500 crore in June. 
Those who would be availing the company’s restructuring plan will have a benefit over the RBI scheme as SBI Card will not report such cases to credit scoring agency Cibil. 
In March, the RBI had allowed the first three-month moratorium on payment of all term loans due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Later it was extended for another three months till August 2020.
The process of restructuring is going on currently, Tewari said, adding a large number of accounts are to be enrolled and the company needs to make a 10 per cent provisioning on these accounts, according to the RBI guidelines. ",business
Equity drag on mutual funds," Mutual funds have pulled out Rs 17,600 crore from the stock markets in July-August mainly on account of withdrawals from equity-oriented schemes.
The pandemic-related disruptions, a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the globe and a volatility in the equity markets led to the massive withdrawals.
Mutual funds had made a net investment of Rs 39,755 crore in the stock markets during January-June 2020, data available with Sebi showed. Foreign portfolio investors (FPI) turned net sellers in the Indian markets by pulling out Rs 2,038 crore so far in September as participants turned cautious in view of rising India-China tensions and weak global cues. 
According to the depositories data, a net Rs 3,510 crore was withdrawn from equities, while Rs 1,472 crore was pumped into debts by FPIs between September 1 and September 11. FPIs were net buyers for three consecutive months — June to August.",business
Gas producers seek pricing formula review," Domestic gas prices are set to fall significantly from October because of a slump in global prices, raising a question mark on the pricing formula as it challenges the operational viability of oil firms and hurts investment sentiment in the exploration and production sector. Gas producers have sought a review of the pricing formula.
The domestic prices are set to fall to about $1.80 per mBtu from October 1 for the next six months, the fourth straight cut, which would significantly hurt domestic producers.
The gas price for locally produced fields has been revised from April 1 till September end to $2.39 per mBtu from $3.23 per mBtu, a 26 per cent decrease. The ceiling price for gas to be produced from difficult fields has also fallen to $5.61 per mBtu from $8.43 per mBtu, down 33.5 per cent.
Oil industry sources said a further cut in prices would make domestic production unviable. Gas producers have written to the oil ministry offering various suggestions, including a review of the formula that puts domestic producers at a disadvantage over imported LNG.
Industry sources said the existing formula is based on the gas surplus market and should not be applicable in India. They said ONGC in a recent communique to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per mBtu.

In previous years, loss from the gas segment was offset by the gain in the oil business. But with the oil business itself coming under severe strain because of a sharp slump in benchmark prices, it has become difficult for the company to meet even the operating expenses, they said.
The reduction in natural gas prices would mean lower raw material cost for compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas to households (PNG) and should translate into a reduction in retail prices. It would also mean lower feedstock cost for power generation and the manufacturing of fertilisers.
However, this could impact the revenue of state-owned PSUs such as ONGC and Oil India, which produce 83 per cent of the domestic gas. Other producers such as Reliance Industries, Vedanta and Hindustan Oil Exploration Company would also see their revenues going down. ",business
"Retail inflation will fall, asserts CEA"," Chief economic adviser K.V. Subramanian has attributed the rise in inflation to supply-side frictions and exuded confidence that retail inflation will come down in the days ahead with the easing of lockdowns.
According to government data, retail inflation rose to 6.93 per cent in July, driven 
by rising prices of food items such as vegetables, pulses, meat and fish.
However, wholesale price-based inflation declined 0.58 per cent in July, even as food items turned costlier. 
“If you look at inflation... it’s primarily because of those supply-side frictions, but as local lockdowns are actually being reduced, these frictions should basically go down,” he said.
“Overall, the difference between wholesale and retail inflation is primarily because of supply-side factors which should decrease and, therefore, going forward even retail inflation should ease,” Subramanian said.

There are fears that retail inflation would remain at an elevated level during the rest of the year, limiting the scope for the RBI to further ease the benchmark interest rate.
The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by the RBI governor has been given the mandate to maintain the annual retail inflation at 4 per cent until March 31, 2021, with an upper tolerance of 6 per cent and a lower tolerance of 2 per cent. 
Retail inflation so far has been in the tolerance range of MPC except for a breach in July. In June, retail inflation was 6.09 per cent. 
At the same time, WPI inflation in June was at (-) 1.81 per cent, while for the month of May and April it was (-) 3.37 per cent and (-) 1.57 per cent, respectively. 
As far as growth is concerned, India’s economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product contracting 23.9 per cent.",business
Leeway for multi-cap mutual funds," The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Sunday sought to allay the concerns of fund managers of multi-cap mutual funds after it tightened the investment rules for the category on Friday.
Sebi had said multi-cap funds must have a minimum corpus of 75 per cent invested in equities against the present requirement of 65 per cent. Moreover, to diversify their investments, it ruled that these funds will have to make a minimum investment of 25 per cent each in equity and equity related instruments of large cap, midcap and smallcap companies. Sebi gave fund houses time till January 2021 to meet this requirement.
The move created a flutter in the domestic mutual fund industry as fund houses began examining options to dodge compulsory purchases of small and midcap stocks.
In a clarification on Sunday, Sebi said multi-cap schemes had flexibility in terms of allocation to large, mid and small cap stocks, based on the preference of their unit holders. Apart from rebalancing their portfolio, they can facilitate a switch to other schemes by unit holders, merge their multi-cap schemes with the large cap ones or convert their multi-cap schemes to another category, for instance a “large-cum-mid cap scheme” to be “true to label”. 
The market regulator said it will examine the proposals of the industry, if any, received in this regard.
Experts had welcomed Friday’s move, pointing out that it will correct the investment structure of multi-cap funds which are tilted heavily in favour of large cap stocks. However, fund managers expressed concern that the poor liquidity in small and midcap stocks will sharply increase the risk for investors investing in these schemes.
The clarification from Sebi could temper the optimism of a rally in small and midcap stocks. 
Dhiraj Sachdev, managing partner and chief investment officer at Roha Asset Managers, told The Telegraph, “This rectification has to be welcomed. Over the last two to three years, we have seen polarisation towards large caps and this will now get corrected.” ",business
Sri Lanka realty battle heats up," Two strands of a bruising court battle are looming on either side of the Palk Strait as a clutch of top builders from Calcutta mount legal challenges to claw back at a prestigious development in Colombo.
Multiple cases are being fought before the company law court in India and the commercial court in Sri Lanka over the fate of the $300-million Altair project which has been declared as a ‘flagship foreign investment project’ in the island nation. 
The first round in what appears to be a long battle has gone to the challenger Jaideep Halwasiya who was granted a stay by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) over his ouster from the board of the Indian firm which used to be the main promoter of the Sri Lankan subsidiary which is building Altair. 
However, Halwasiya may have to toil hard to maintain the early lead as the Commercial High court of Colombo is ready to hear a case filed by the Indian parent to challenge the manner in which it has been reduced to a minority in Altair after the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka paved the way for the hearing on September 8. The Commercial High Court in Colombo could hear the matter as early as Monday or Tuesday while the NCLAT order was delivered on September 4. At the heart of the dispute is a change in ownership of the Sri Lankan company, Indocean Developers Pvt Ltd (IDPL), the promoter of Altair.
Calcutta-based AA Infraproperties (AAI) used to own 100 per cent share of IDPL. Its stake is now down to 13.84 per cent after Halwasiya issued fresh shares to entities linked to him.
South City Projects (Kolkata) Ltd, which holds 87.5 per cent in AAI — the remaining 12.5 per cent is with Halwasiya — claims that the issuance of shares in IDPL was an act of fraud perpetrated by Halwasiya to wrest control of Altair. 
SCPL, which is owned by top city builders Sushil Mohta, Pradeep Sureka, Jugal Khetawat, Rajendra Bachhawat and Emami Group, has in turn lost control of Altair — two towers leaning one over another overlooking the sea — which is nearing completion after at least two years of delay. A bench comprising acting chairperson Bansi Lal Bhat overturned an order of NCLT, Calcutta, which declined to grant an interim stay to Halwasiya plea to challenge his removal from AAI via an extraordinary general meeting of January 4 and the induction of three additional directors by an AGM on September 24, 2019.
While returning the matter to the lower court, NCLAT observed: “We are of the opinion that the impugned order suffers from (a) grave legal infirmity besides factual frailty. (The) Same cannot be supported. The appeal is allowed and the impugned order is set aside.
Appointment of respondents No. 4 to 6 as directors and removal of the appellant as the director is stayed till the decision on the company petition by the tribunal.” AAI had sought to remove Halwasiya from the board after the change in shareholding of IDPL came to light.  AAI had moved Commercial High Court in Colombo to challenge the dilution of their equity interest in IDPL. However, it now appears that the court has to first adjudicate on who represents AAI after the NCLAT order. There is only one director representing the interests of South City promoters after the appointment of three directors were stayed. The other director is Halwasiya himself.
AAI is challenging the validity of a power of attorney purportedly granted to Halwasiya in 2019 to represent the Indian parent in Sri Lanka.",business

Singapore Convention in force," The Singapore Convention on Mediation came into force on Saturday and will provide a more effective way to enforce mediated settlements of corporate disputes involving businesses in India and other countries that are signatories to the Convention.
Also known as the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, this is also the first UN treaty to be named after Singapore.
“With the Convention in force, businesses seeking enforcement of a mediated settlement agreement across borders can do so by applying directly to the courts of countries that have signed and ratified the treaty, instead of having to enforce the settlement agreement as a contract in accordance with each country’s domestic process,” an official statement said on Saturday.
The harmonised and simplified enforcement framework under the Convention translates to savings in time and legal costs, which is especially important for businesses in times of uncertainty, such as during the current Covid-19 pandemic, the statement issued by Singapore's Ministry of Law said.
As on September 1, the Convention has 53 signatories, including India, China and the US.

“Businesses in India and around the world will now have greater certainty in resolving cross-border disputes through mediation, as the Convention provides a more effective means for mediated outcomes to be enforced,” it said.
Singapore had worked with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and other UN member states and non-governmental organisations to contribute to the development of the Convention.
Singapore’s minister for home affairs and law K. Shanmugam said the Convention’s entry into force is a significant milestone as it further strengthens the international dispute resolution enforcement framework.
“This benefits businesses by providing greater certainty in resolving cross-border commercial disputes, ultimately facilitating international trade and commerce,” he added.
Secretary of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Joubin-Bret said that with the Convention successfully entering into force, “we look forward to it bringing certainty and stability to the international framework on mediation, and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.”
Over the years, Singapore has set up various institutions to provide a full suite of dispute resolution services for international commercial parties to resolve their disputes in Singapore.
These include the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, Singapore International Mediation Centre and Singapore International Commercial Court, the statement said.",business
More cash comfort for lockdown-hit discoms," The Rs 90,000-crore liquidity package for discoms to help them pay their dues till the month of March would soon be enhanced to Rs 1.2 lakh crore by factoring in these utilities’ outstanding till June, said a senior official.
In May, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a Rs 90,000-crore liquidity infusion into cash-strapped discoms for payment of their dues till March 2020.
Discoms have been facing a demand slump because of the lockdown to contain Covid-19.        
Participating in a webinar on “Innovation in Renewable Energy” organised by PHDCCI, power secretary S.N. Sahai said the liquidity package would cover the dues of discoms for the months from April to June also and it would be enhanced to Rs 1.2 lakh crore.
While announcing the package, the government had said, “At present, discoms have a total outstanding of Rs 94,000 crore towards power generation firms (gencos).”

However, later states demanded that the package be extended to include the dues towards power generation and transmission firms for the months of April and May as well.
A source said that an official communication has already been sent to the implementing state-owned non-banking finance firms Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC by the power ministry. The source further said the respective boards of REC and PFC will approve the hike in the liquidity package to around Rs 1.2 lakh crore covering dues till June this year by the end of September.",business
Gems and jewellery exports up 29.18% in August from July," Gems and jewellery exports showed signs of recovery in August, rising 29.18 per cent to Rs 13,160.24 crore ($1,764.06 million) in August compared with the previous month following a gradual growth in demand in the US, China and Europe, the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) said on Saturday.
The total shipments in July stood at Rs 10,187.04 crore ($1,358.58 million), the GJEPC said in a statement.

“All the gems and jewellery export units are working in full swing and the trade is getting back to normal.
“We are optimistic that we will be able to have a decent recovery in exports from the current levels and restrict the downside of exports to just over 20-25 per cent at the closure of the financial year,’’ Colin Shah, chairman of GJEPC, said.

HDFC Bank ups card rates," HDFC Bank has raised the interest rates on the revolving balances on credit cards and late payment fees at a time default rates are rising because of Covid-19.
The charges on revolving credit on certain cards have been raised to 3.6 per cent per month, or 43.2 per cent annually, from 3.49 per cent per month (41.88 per cent annually) from September 1.
Charges will go up for customers holding Regalia, Business Regalia, Regalia First, Business Regalia First, Doctors Regalia, Diners Privilege, Diners ClubMiles, Millennia, Millennia Easy EMI, InterMiles Signature, InterMiles World, Indigo 6E Rewards, Indigo 6E XL, Indian Oil Card, Times Titanium and Times Platinum cards.
The late payment charges have been increased to Rs 1,100 for those with a statement balance of Rs 25,000-50,000 and to Rs 1,300 for a balance of over Rs 50,000. Till August 31, the bank was charging a flat fee of Rs 950 on late payments. In April, the late payment fee was Rs 750 — which means that this hike is the second since the outbreak of the crisis.
According to Macquarie Research, late payment fees account for around 22 per cent of any card issuer’s total fee income.
HDFC Bank is the country’s largest credit card issuer. According to RBI data at the end of June this year, HDFC Bank had over 1.45 crore credit cards in circulation. The number of transactions made by its credit card customers at PoS terminals was over 3.58 crore. Industry circles do not rule out the possibility of its peers following suit.
HDFC Bank allows a grace period of three days from the payment due date on credit card accounts where payments are not overdue. The due date as mentioned in the credit card statement is the date by which clear funds must be credited to the credit card. However, three grace days are provided to accommodate the processing time of payments. HDFC Bank has said that it will report a credit card account as “past due” to credit information companies (CICs) and levy a late payment charge when a credit card account remains past due for more than three days.
Angshuman Chatterjee, head (consumer credit cards and digital acquisitions) at HDFC Bank, had recently said that the number of customers buying high-value products through instalments stood at an all-time high during the pandemic. Chatterjee further said customers were opting for larger spends by breaking them up into simple EMIs, which is helping consumption.",business
Annuity rate shield," The widening gap between returns in the accumulation phase and the return on annuities offered to National Pension System (NPS) subscribers on retirement has prompted the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) to “actively” consider an alternative.
NPS subscribers can withdraw 60 per cent of their accumulated corpus on retirement and the remaining 40 per cent needs to be invested in annuities offered by empanelled life insurers, including LIC.
While the subscribers get an average return of around 9 per cent on their corpus during the accumulation phase, the return on annuities has gone below 6 per cent with  falling interest rates. Moreover, in the case of annuities, the amount is fixed for life and the payouts are taxable.
To protect the interest of the pensioners, PFRDA chairman Supratim Bandyopadhyay said a systematic withdrawal plan, similar to what mutual funds offer, is being planned to protect the retirement corpus.
He did not give a timeline as the process would need parliamentary approval.
“Annuity rates normally track interest rates. As the interest rates are coming down, annuity rates have also come down. We are exploring whether we can manage the withdrawal part within our system and try to give a kind of systematic withdrawal to the retired employee. We cannot give a timeline now. But, we are considering this actively,” Bandyopadhyay said at an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.
A systematic withdrawal plan could offer retired individuals withdrawals at periodic intervals while potentially offering a better management of the funds and higher return.
Bandyopadhyay said  public sector undertakings are increasingly shifting from their own superannuation funds to NPS. However, the rate of adoption among corporates is low.
He added that the central government employees’ fund over the past 12 years has given a return of around 9.95 per cent with 15 per cent equity exposure.",business
July factory output falls at lower rate," Industrial output declined 10.4 per cent in July — contracting for the fifth straight month, though at a milder pace — pulled down by lower output in manufacturing, mining and power generation.
Analysts expect industries to take a longer time to recover because of the localised lockdown to contain the pandemic, which is spreading at a rapid pace across the country.
“The indices for June 2020 have undergone the first revision and those for April 2020 have undergone the final revision.
“The Quick Estimates for July 2020 have been compiled at a weighted response rate of 87 per cent, the first revision for June 2020 at a weighted response rate of 93 per cent and the final revision for April 2020 at a weighted response rate of 94 per cent,” the ministry of statistics and programme implementation said. However, it was silent on the revision of May output numbers.
The index for July 2020 stands at 118.1 compared with 54.0 in April, 89.5 in May and 108.9 in  June. The index had contracted 15.7 per cent in June; 33.8 per cent in May and 57.3 per cent in April. In July last year, factory output had expanded by 4.9 per cent.

Moody’s sees 11.5% contraction," Moody’s Investors Service on Friday said the economy was likely to see a sharper contraction of 11.5 per cent in the current fiscal compared with a 4 per cent contraction estimated earlier. The agency feels the contraction would be more pronounced because of the lockdown and continued rise in coronavirus cases.
The US-based rating agency also projected India’s debt burden to peak at 90 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal and the Centre’s fiscal deficit to be close to 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
In the previous fiscal, India’s debt burden was 72 per cent of GDP, while fiscal deficit stood at 4.6 per cent.
India’s GDP contracted 23.9 per cent year-on-year in the April-June quarter, following the economic impact of the lockdown measures.
“The collapse in GDP was one of the sharpest among all major G-20 economies. We now expect real GDP to contract 11.5 per cent in the financial year starting April 2020, much weaker than our previous forecast of a 4 per cent contraction,” Moody’s said.

It expects growth to rebound to 10.6 per cent in fiscal 2021, reflecting a strong statistical base effect from the low GDP levels of 2020 as economic activity gradually normalises.
The sharp decline in growth will result in materially weaker government revenue.
Combined with increased fiscal expenditure in response to the coronavirus outbreak, this will contribute to a wider general government fiscal deficit, which it expects to reach 12 per cent of GDP in this fiscal, Moody’s said. Domestic rating agency CARE Ratings said the economy is likely to shrink 8-8.2 per cent in the current financial year compared with a decline of 6.4 per cent it had projected earlier.",business
Lodhas skip Pilani voting," Rajashree Birla will continue on the board of Pilani Investment and Industries Corporation Ltd as a director after two investment firms under the control of Harsh Vardhan Lodha abstained from voting today on a special resolution seeking to give effect to her appointment at the annual general meeting.
The special resolution, which must be carried by a three-fourths majority of the members present and voting, became necessary as Rajashree Birla turns 75 on September 15. The Sebi listing rules mandate that shareholders must pass a special resolution for the reappointment of all directors above 75.
Rajashree Birla is the mother of Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla.
Pilani Investment and Industries Corporation is a premier Birla family investment company set up by patriarch Ghanashyam Das Birla in 1948.
The scrutiniser of the voting at the AGM has yet to issue his report and the results will likely come in the next few days.
However, sources confirmed that entities belonging to the erstwhile MP Birla group -- and now controlled by Harsh Vardhan Lodha -- chose to abstain from voting.
The Lodhas, who have been locked in a spate of cases with the Birlas, hold around 25 per cent in Pilani. Their decision to abstain will pave the way for Rajashree Birla to be reinstated on the board.
The Birla family entities as promoters of Pilani Investment hold a 57.55 per cent stake and would have required active or tacit support of the public shareholders, including the Lodha-controlled firms, to carry any special resolution.
The Birla family and the Lodhas are enmeshed in bitter legal disputes ever since Late Priyamvada Devi Birla bequeathed the reign of M.P. Birla empire to Rajendra Singh Lodha, Harsh’s father, in 2004 by a will.
Angered at the turn of events that an ‘outsider’ would gain control of a slice of Birla family empire, the purported will was challenged by the family, led by Basant Kumar Birla, grandfather of Kumar Mangalam.
More than 100 cases have been filed by either side since then. Both B.K. Birla and R.S. Lodha passed away in 2019 and 2008 respectively.
The Lodhas' decision to abstain from voting at the Pilani AGM comes at a time when a single judge is hearing the probate of the will sought by Lodha even as the Birla camp has renewed its efforts to dislodge Harsh Lodha from the M.P. Birla group companies.
Harsh Lodha sits on the board of all the operating companies of M.P. Birla and acts as their chairman. 
“Lodha would not have gained control of Pilani by blocking Rajashree on the board and, hence, may have decided not to vote,” said a source. Lodha did not respond to text messages or phone calls.
Unsurprisingly, Birla camp had a different take. “If a company (Pilani) is doing well and the investment is safe and giving return, why rock the boat?” they argued to explain Lodha's decision. The reappointment of Rajashree Birla had some dramatic moments in the lead up to the AGM.  On September 5, she informed the board that she would not be seeking re-appointment without assigning any reason.
This sparked a piquant prospect where for the first time in 70 years, there might be no one from the Birla clan on the board of the investment company which has stakes in several top Birla companies including Century Textiles, Kesoram, Hindalco, and Ultratech.
The company then informed the bourses of the withdrawal of the resolutions pertaining to her appointment.
Two days later on September 7, the company again informed the bourses that she had agreed to stay on at the request of the rest of the directors and the special resolution relating to her appointment was back on the table for a vote. The investment company, founded by GD Birla, bears the name of the village from Birla family hails in Rajasthan. Before it was relocated to Calcutta, Pilani was headquartered in Gwalior, a princely state before independence, which attracted many companies due to the benign tax system and easy compliance.
Three factions of the Birla family — Ghanshyam Das and his two brothers — had equal shares in them. While the share of M.P. Birla is now under control of Lodha, the rest is now consolidated and owned by Kumar Birla and his grandfather's estate.",business
Tatas to stymie Cyrus share pledge," The battle between the Tatas and the Shapoorji Pallonji group has erupted once again: this time over the cash-strapped SP group’s plan to raise funds by pledging a tiny sliver of its 18.4 per cent stake in Tata Sons with a bunch of Canadian investors for Rs 3,750 crore.
The SP Group signed a definitive agreement for the loan pledge on September 4 -- and the Tatas retaliated on the following day by moving an “urgent application” before the Supreme Court to stop them from doing so.
The Shapoorji Pallonji group has been locked in battle with the Tatas ever since Cyrus Mistry was removed from his position as chairman of the Tata group in October 2016 in a boardroom coup.
The real estate and construction group has been planning to raise Rs 11,000 crore that it desperately needs to tide over an acute funds crunch precipitated by the pandemic.
The group had signed a deal with Brookfield -- a marquee Canadian investment  firm  -- to raise a sum of Rs 3750 crore in the first tranche.

The SP group has argued that the pledge of the Tata Sons shares was a legitimate practice in the industry and does not amount to the transfer of ownership. The group said that it needed funds as it had been badly hit by the pandemic that has knocked the bottom out of most of its businesses including real estate and construction.
The 18.4 per cent stake held by the SP group is valued at about Rs 1 lakh crore.
The Tatas are afraid that the loan pledge is just a ruse to circumvent a proviso in the articles of association of the $111 billion Tata group’s holding company -- which turned into a private company in controversial circumstances in August 2018 -- that grants a right of first refusal to the Tatas before any share sale can go through.
Through the petition, the Tatas have sought to prevent the SP Group from creating any direct or indirect pledge of shares.
Reacting to the application by Tata Sons which was made on September, the SP Group said the vindictive move amounts to oppression of minority shareholder rights.
“The promoters of the SP Group are in the process of raising around Rs 11,000 crore from marquee global investors with Rs 3,750 crore being raised in the first tranche, against the security of shares that their investment companies own in Tata Sons. These funds are intended to mitigate the severe stress caused by Covid pandemic, deleverage the group’s balance sheet, support its financial obligations and protect the livelihoods of its workforce,” a spokesperson for the SP Group said.
The spokesperson added that the “vindictive move by Tata Sons is solely aimed to create delays and roadblocks in the fund raise that will jeopardize the future of 60,000 employees and over 1 lakh migrant workers who draw sustenance by working at various SP Group facilities. This calculated move by the Tatas is intended to inflict irreparable damage on the SP Group. These actions are a departure from the values and ethos of the founders of the Tata Group and is an unfortunate reflection of the mindset of the present leadership. We will vigorously contest these frivolous and misguided claims in the Supreme Court”.
The SP Group further said the articles of association of Tata Sons only regulate transfer of shares and the Tata Sons board only has a right of first refusal to buy back, at fair market value, the shares of any minority shareholder who is seeking to exit.
“There is absolutely no provision in the articles of Tata Sons that restrict the creation of a pledge or encumbrance,” the SP Group said.
The spokesperson further said the group “will ask the Supreme Court to dismiss the Tatas’ application at the threshold by highlighting the settled position in law that a mere creation of a pledge on shares would not amount to a transfer of title of the shares”.
Questioning the motive and timing of Tata’s application, the SP Group pointed out that it had raised funds against Tata Sons shares in January 2020.
“The security documents, which are in public domain, clearly record that lenders would comply with the articles of Tata Sons in the event they seek to enforce the pledge of shares. The Tatas have suppressed this vital information in their application in their desperate bid to mislead the apex court,” the spokesperson added.
The group also quoted the opinion of Justice (Retd) Srikrishna, a former judge of the Supreme Court. “The ability of Cyrus Investments and Sterling to pledge their shares in Tata Sons in favour of third party is not in any way controlled by the Articles of Tata Sons. This is so because the pledge of shares does not amount to a transfer of the title to the shares, as the title of the shares would continue with the pledgor,” the retired judge said.
In their 152-page supplementary petition against Cyrus Investment submitted to the Supreme Court on September 5, Tata Sons sought to prevent the Mistry group from “creating any charge/pledge/interest/ encumbrance on the shares of Tata Sons in any manner, either directly or indirectly and also to further direct them to forthwith remove any charge/pledge/ interest/ encumbrance created by them”.
“It is respectfully submitted that creation of a pledge in this manner, without informing the Tatas and seeking the leave of this SC, is in absolute derogation of the spirit of this court's January 10 order, wherein the Tata voluntarily gave a good faith undertaking to not exercise their rights under Article 75 against Mistrys,” it said.
Article 75 gives the Tatas the power, via a special resolution, to squeeze out the Mistry family by buying out their shareholding at fair market value.",business
Titagarh inks solar power pact," Titagarh Wagons has signed a power purchase agreement with renewable energy firm Fourth Partner Energy to procure 4.8MW of solar power for its units in Bengal. The company plans to replace 25 per cent of its current annual electricity demand with clean energy.
Three installations in Titagarh and Uttarpara will be spread over 48,000 square metre of roof space which will offset over 1.3 lakh tonnes of carbon in the next two decades for Titagarh Wagons.
The installation is expected to be commissioned by January 2021.
“Apart from a significant reduction in our carbon footprint, solar power is cheaper than grid electricity. We expect to see substantial savings in our annual power cost through solar energy. We shall evaluate adding solar power capacity in these as well as other units to increase the percentage of clean energy used in our plants,” said Pritish Chowdhary, vice-president, Titagarh Wagons.

Inflation forecast above target," There is unlikely to be any good news on the inflation front with prices rising above the Reserve Bank of India’s medium term target in August, a Reuters poll has showed.
The poll of nearly 50 economists showed retail inflation to rise 6.85 per cent for the month because of supply disruptions which kept food and fuel prices high. Though this is lower than the 6.93 per cent rise in July, it still means that headline CPI inflation is above the RBI’s target of 2-6 per cent for the fifth straight month.
This would disappoint those expecting another round of interest rate cut from the RBI. The central bank has since March brought down the policy repo rate by 115 basis points. However, firm inflation saw the monetary policy committee deciding on a status quo in the August policy.
A report from the economic research wing of State Bank of India (SBI) also expects inflation to be well above the 6 per cent mark in August.
Attributing the recent surge in retail inflation to huge government procurement and supply disruptions on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the SBI report said the rate of price rise was likely to come down to below 4 per cent only after December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation during August was likely to remain at about 7 per cent, SBI Ecowrap said. The data is scheduled to be released on Monday.
However, the report said that it looks difficult to believe that supply disruptions would normalise soon.",business
Fuel demand declines in August," The country’s fuel demand in August saw its biggest decline in monthly sales since April because of a surge in coronavirus cases which continue to impact economic activity.
Sales of refined fuels, a proxy for oil demand, fell to 14.39 million tonnes in August, about 16 per cent lower from a year earlier, its sixth consecutive year-on-year slide.
It also fell 7.5 per cent from July, its biggest month-on-month decline after April, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas showed.
Fuel demand had slumped a record 48.6 per cent in April to 9.4 million tonnes as the government imposed a nationwide lockdown in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. It recovered in the subsequent two months but has been falling again since July, on a monthly basis.
Sale of diesel, the most consumed fuel, fell 12 per cent to 4.84 million tonnes in August from 5.51 million tonnes in the previous month.
Petrol sales fell 7.4 per cent year-on-year to 2.38 million tonnes although it rose 5.3 per cent from 2.26 million tonnes in July as commuters preferred driving personal vehicles to using public transportation.
Demand for aviation turbine fuel grew 9.9 per cent to 256 million tonnes, growing for the fourth consecutive month, as domestic carriers ramped up services.",business
Indiabulls sells UK bank stake," Indiabulls Housing Finance on Thursday said it has sold a part of its stake in the UK-based OakNorth Holding Ltd, the parent company of OakNorth Bank Ltd, to HighSage Ventures LLC for Rs 440 crore.
In a regulatory filing, Indiabulls Housing Finance said that the sale proceeds will be accretive to the regulatory net worth and the capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of the non-banking finance company.
On Wednesday, the company had informed about a partial stake sale in OakNorth Bank in one or more tranches to boost its capital.
HighSage Ventures LLC is a Boston-based investment firm with an investor network spanning the venture capital, private equity and public equity communities.
“The company plans to conclude a few other transactions on the partial stake sale in OakNorth Bank over the next few days. The divestments in OakNorth Bank will result in boosting CRAR and shall free up capital to grow the loan book of the company,” Indiabulls Housing Finance added.

CIL to revive 12 closed mines," Coal India is planning to revive underground mine production in a bid to boost overall output.
The public sector miner has identified 12 mines with provisional reserves of around 1,060 million tonnes (mt). Of these, eight mines with estimated reserves of 596mt belong to Eastern Coalfields and four mines with a reserve of 464 mt belong to Bharat Coking Coal.
Bengal and Jharkhand stand to benefit from this revival move with all 12 mines spread across the two states. Of the 12 mines, seven are in Bengal.
Coal India’s primary production is from opencast mining with underground mining constituting less than 10 per cent of the overall production.
According to Coal India officials, these underground mines were discontinued earlier not because of exhaustion of reserves but on account of difficult geo-mining conditions, economic unviability and lack of suitable methods at that time to extract coal from deep seated reserves.

Underground mines tend to have better quality of coal. Moreover, five of the mines have coking coal, which is used in steel making and is scarce in the country .
“With the advancement of technology in coal mining, it is now possible to extract the locked coal reserves of these mines and this has prompted us to explore this option once again,” a CIL executive said.
The Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, the in-house mine consultancy arm of Coal India, will prepare a feasibility report. Subsequently, coal companies will float tenders according to their requirement to engage suitable developers and operators and firms with the requisite technical knowhow to pursue the operations on their behalf.
“The project is on the drawing board but CIL aims to start the process soon to bring these mines to active production. This is an effort towards increasing production from indigenous sources,” said the executive.
In the ongoing fiscal, Coal India has increased its pace of production, recording a 9.3 per cent growth in offtake and 7.1 per cent growth in production for August compared with last year after mining in the early months was affected by the nationwide lockdown and the monsoons.
“The growth slowdown is contained and going forward we hope to maintain our production and off-take tempo,” the executive said.",business
BSNL asset sale plan," The department of telecommunications has mooted a draft cabinet note on asset monetisation of BSNL and MTNL as part of a Rs 69,000-crore revival package for the state-owned telecom firms.
Officials said the asset monetisation will help the two operators to upgrade their network, offer voluntary retirement schemes and also repay a part of their debt.
The two PSUs have a combined debt of about Rs 40,000 crore.
Sources said CBRE, JLL and Knight Frank  — the consultants appointed to identify the land and other properties for monetisation —have submitted their preliminary reports. The land parcels identified are spread across the country in locations such as Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai and Ghaziabad.
The three consultants were asked to look at the valuation of the land assets, gauge the market appetite and assess the process that could be adopted for monetisation.
The officials said it would take a few years for the asset monetisation process to be complete and much would depend on the prevailing market conditions. The draft cabinet note just kicks off the process.
Sanjay Dhotre, the minister of state for communications, had informed the Lok Sabha last year that BSNL and MTNL had identified 14 and 16 properties, respectively, “for monetisation through the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). Eleven  properties of BSNL and six of MTNL have been approved for monetisation by DIPAM’s Alternate Mechanism”.
In October last year, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said: “BSNL and MTNL are strategic assets. They will raise a sovereign bond of Rs 15,000 crore and their assets will be monetised. The cabinet has also approved an attractive VRS package for the employees.”
Over the last few weeks, both the companies have launched their VRS plans and thousands of employees have opted for the scheme. The scheme will help reduce BSNL’s wage bill by 50 per cent and MTNL’s by 75 per cent.",business
Jane Fraser to lead Citigroup," Citigroup said on Thursday that its chief executive, Michael Corbat, plans to retire in February, paving the way for his top lieutenant, Jane Fraser, to become the first woman to lead a big Wall Street bank.
Corbat, who has served as chief executive since 2012, will be succeeded by Fraser, who is Citi’s president and the head of its global consumer banking business. A 16-year veteran of the firm, Fraser was teed up as the bank’s next CEO last year when she was promoted to her current role.
Fraser has also overseen several of the bank’s businesses, serving as the chief executive of its private bank, its Latin American region and its US consumer and commercial bank and mortgage business. She worked at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company before joining Citi in 2004.

“We believe Jane is the right person to build on Mike’s record and take Citi to the next level,” John C. Dugan, Citi’s chairman, said in a statement. “She has deep experience across our lines of business and regions, and we are highly confident about her.”
Fraser’s ascension will break one of corporate America’s longest-enduring glass ceilings. At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee last April, one lawmaker asked Corbat and six of his peers to raise their hand if any of them believed they would be succeeded by a woman or person of colour. None did.
Fraser, 53, is poised to join a very small group of female leaders at major corporations. There are only 31 women among the CEOs of the 500 companies that make up the S&P 500 stock index, according to the advocacy group Catalyst.
Succession plans at other Wall Street firms may now attract more attention.
JPMorgan Chase, for example, has two women, Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, among the potential candidates to succeed its longtime chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon.
Under Corbat — who took over in 2012 after the sudden resignation of his predecessor, Vikram S. Pandit, amid a revolt by its board — the bank sought to rebuild after the 2008 global financial crisis.
In its statement, Citi noted that its net income during Corbat’s tenure grew to nearly $20 billion last year, from $7 billion in 2012.

SC against interest penalty," The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will announce its verdict on the plea for an interest waiver during the six-month loan moratorium period till August 31 in two weeks’ time. The court allowed parties to file all documents and decisions in the next two weeks.
The court indicated that banks may not be allowed to charge interest on interest during the six-month moratorium period on loans even as it gave the Centre and the RBI two weeks to come out with a suitable mechanism on charging interest from customers and allay their apprehensions regarding credit rating downgrades by banks.
A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R. Subhash Reddy and M.R. Shah passed the directions after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre sought two weeks adjournment on the grounds that the issue with regard to compound interests, downgrading of credit ratings during the moratorium period was being considered “at the highest level”.
“With respect to interest, we are yet to take a decision but on the aspect of debiting of interest on interest, we are inclined to pass an order that it may not be debited,” Justice Bhushan heading the bench orally observed during the hearing.
In other words, the court holds prima facie the view that it would not be proper for banks to charge interest on interest during the six-month moratorium on loans announced by the RBI which ended on August 31.
The court also recorded the submission of various petitioners that status quo be maintained on the court’s interim order. The order said no account shall be declared NPA by banks post August 31 till the present matter was resolved.
The bench was dealing with a batch of petitions filed by UP-based businessman Gajendra Sharma and several others challenging the banks’ decision to charge interests on interests during the six-month moratorium period. The petitioners also wanted the extension of the moratorium period which had ended on August 31.
Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for banks’ association said that norms and guidelines have to be issued with regard to individual borrowers. The bench asked who will formulate “these norms” to which Salve replied that the finance ministry will do as it has been done at the level of the RBI.
Mehta said that it was being done at a level higher than the RBI and whatever will be there it would be comprehensive. Salve pointed out that for the power sector, the states will have to be taken on board as entire loans cannot be put on banks. The government has formed a three-member committee under former CAG Rajiv Mehrishi to look into the concerns raised during the Supreme Court hearings in the Covid-19 loan moratorium case.
The panel will help the government assess the need to offer relief to borrowers on the issue of interest charged on loan instalments deferred during the moratorium period. The panel will measure the impact of the pandemic on the economy and the financial viability of waiving of interest and of interest on interest for this payment holiday.
The committee will suggest ways to alleviate financial constraints of borrowers and other suitable measures, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The committee will also have Ravindra H. Dholakia, former professor, IIM Ahmedabad & ex-member, Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI, and B. Sriram, former managing director, State Bank of India & IDBI Bank. The committee will submit its report within a week.

Reliance’s market capitalisation hits $200 billion," Reliance on Thursday became the first Indian company to record a market capitalisation of $200 billion. News of Silver Lake Partners investing in its retail arm and the possibility of similar announcements over the next few weeks buoyed the stock.
On the BSE, the RIL share closed at Rs 2,314.65, a gain of Rs 153.40 or 7.10 per cent. Earlier in the day, the stock hit a 52-week high of Rs 2343.90 — a rise of 8.45 per cent over the previous close. At close, it had a market cap of Rs 14.67 lakh crore or $199.74 billion.
RIL’s partly paid shares also finished 10 per cent higher, leading to a market cap of Rs 58,937.43 crore — adding up to a total market cap of almost $208 billion.
In July 2018, RIL had re-claimed a $100-billion market cap after a period of 11 years. However, the jump in its market value has been meteoric in the past six months, particularly after March.
After hitting a 52-week low of Rs 867.82 as markets were hit by fears over the Covid-19 pandemic, its shares have rallied a whopping 170 per cent after it announced a string of investments in its digital services business.",business
Amazon eyes foothold in RIL Retail," Retail industry rivals Mukesh Ambani and Jeff Bezos could bake the bread together in India with Bezos’s Amazon reportedly eyeing a slice of Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ventures, which has started selling a part of the equity to global investors.
Bloomberg on Thursday said Amazon.com Inc was in discussions with Reliance Industries Limited to invest around $20 billion in Ambani’s retail business.
RIL could even sell as much as a 40 per cent stake in Reliance Retail Ventures to Amazon. Though the buzz of Amazon investing in the retail arm of RIL has been doing the rounds the past couple of months, a stake sale of such a magnitude should come as a surprise.
“We would like to reiterate that as a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours and we cannot confirm or deny any transaction which may or may not be in the works. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis,” Reliance said in a clarification to the stock exchanges after market hours.
“We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under Securities Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 and our agreements with the stock exchanges,” Reliance said.

Amazon’s keenness to invest in the retail business of RIL comes only a day after it sold 1.75 per cent in Reliance Retail Ventures to US private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for Rs 7,500 crore. According to the analysts at Credit Suisse, the combined entity can leverage the deep offline network of Reliance Retail and the established logistics network of Amazon to harness cross-selling and omni-channel opportunities.
The brokerage said RIL can benefit through an increase in the addressable user base for JioMart via access to the existing 140 million monthly active users of Amazon.
Besides, the business of cash-and-carry arm Reliance Market would grow with Amazon sellers such as Cloudtail and Appario Retail supplying their products to it.
On the other hand, Amazon will gain access to a large logistics network, which has further strengthened post Reliance Retail’s acquisition of Future Group’s logistics and warehousing business.
Amazon will also expand its user base by tapping footfalls in the Reliance Retail stores to drive its online cross-purchases.
Brokerages have also signalled the risks to the deal: one being the integration of Amazon Pay with WhatsApp Pay.
JP Morgan said that though such a transaction would be positive for Reliance Retail, there are certain matters which they are unable to “square off”.
“What would happen to growth plans for JioMart/New Commerce; WhatsApp partnership?” its analysts asked.",business
Airfare refund quibble," The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to clarify through an additional affidavit the government’s assurance that passengers who had booked flight tickets before the Covid-19 lockdown would also be refunded the cancelled fares along with those who had booked tickets during the actual lockdown period.
The court passed the direction after senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for some passengers, expressed apprehension that the recent affidavit filed by the DGCA did not specify whether those passengers who booked tickets prior to the lockdown would be refunded the cancelled fares, too.
“We only want to say relief should not be confined to those who booked tickets during the first lockdown.
“The affidavit gives an impression that relief is confined to only those who had booked during the first lockdown. Relief should be granted to everyone whose flights had been cancelled because of the lockdown,” Hegde said.
Justice Ashok Bhushan asked solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, whether cancellation of tickets for travel during lockdown but booked before it were also taken care of, to which Mehta said: “Yes.”
However, the court wanted a written assurance and asked the government to clarify the point through an additional affidavit.
“Airlines and other stakeholders have prayed for one week’s time to file their reply to the affidavit. The request in granted.
“Tushar Mehta may also file the additional affidavit within the same period,” the bench headed by Justice Bhushan said, listing the matter for further hearing on September 23.
The Centre had in a recent affidavit assured the court that passengers would be entitled to full refund of their cancelled fares for all tickets booked during lockdown 1 and 2 between March 25 to May 3.",business
Satchet-sized credit only way to survive: Viral Acharya," Public sector banks should learn from FMCG players and “democratise credit”, a move that can help state-run banks solve the “biggest fiscal challenge” of recapitalisation, former RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya said on Wednesday. 
Acharya further said that re-privatisation of the lenders is necessary to help reduce the recapitalisation burden and stressed that public sector banks (PSBs) have had a mixed performance on financial inclusion.
Banks were nationalised in 1969 and depend on the government for capital support, which has gone up with the spurt in NPAs. In the present times, as Covid-19 is likely to have an impact on buffers, many of the private sector banks have already raised capital but most of the PSBs are yet to move on and there is speculation of re-privatising some of the PSBs.
“There are some PSBs whose business model is so broken in my assessment that there won’t be any immediate suitors who are interested in buying their equity in a significant manner or at decent prices. What is the option? I’d say they should focus on sachetisation or democratisation of credit,” Acharya said, speaking at a summit organised by ETBFSI.com.
“Learning from the FMCG companies on how to democratise credit through a satchetisation approach would actually solve one of the biggest fiscal challenges that the country faces right now, which is how to ensure that the bills the government has to keep paying for recapitalising public sector banks can be brought down,” he added.
Just like the fast-moving consumer goods ((FMCG) companies did with the shampoo selling in the 1970s, credit can be extended in small packets by such state-run lenders to the financially excluded people, Acharya said. SBI managing director Arijit Basu warned that banks should not solely focus on the retail segment as sluggish growth can impact this category of loans. “A complete shift to retail may not be in the best interests because if your economy doesn’t grow, even your retail at some point of time would get impacted,” Basu said at the virtual event.
SBI on Wednesday said it has raised Rs 4,000 crore through  Basel-III compliant debt instruments. ",business
Flaws surface in Boeing Dreamliner," Boeing Co has warned of delays in deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner as three separate production flaws over the past year hamper efforts to develop an alternative cash cow to its grounded 737 MAX.
In the latest issue, Boeing learned during fabrication of the 787 horizontal stabiliser that some components were clamped with greater force than specified, which could result in improper gap verification and shimming. Boeing identified the problem in February and announced it on Tuesday.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it “is investigating manufacturing flaws affecting certain Boeing 787 jetliners. The agency continues to engage with Boeing”.
A person briefed on the matter said the horizontal stabiliser issue could require the inspection of as many as about 900 airplanes.
Boeing said the stabiliser issue, identified at a production plant in Salt Lake City, Utah, was being corrected on airplanes not yet delivered and was not an immediate flight safety issue.

“Analysis is underway to determine if action is required on the in-service fleet,” Boeing added.
 On Monday, the FAA said it was also investigating two other manufacturing flaws in some Boeing 787 Dreamliners, but said it was too early to say if it will require new inspections.
In late August, Boeing had said that airlines had removed eight 787 Dreamliners from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues in fuselage sections.
Boeing said on Monday some airplanes have shims that are not the proper size, and some airplanes have areas that do not meet skin flatness specifications. Boeing identified the shimming issue in August 2019. “Individually these issues, while not up to specifications, still meet limit load conditions. When combined in the same location, however, they result in a condition that does not meet limit load requirements,” Boeing said.
Boeing said it expected the inspections to affect the timing of 787 deliveries in the near term. Boeing also said it secured its first 737 MAX order in 2020, while also recording more cancellations as customers continued to ditch orders for the grounded MAX jets.",business
Freight sop boosts rail cargo traffic," Concessions have pushed up overall freight loading for Eastern Railways, which has set its sight to surpass the target of 69 million tonnes for 2020-21.
Coal comprises over 60 per cent of the cargo handled by Eastern Railways.
The Railway Board had earlier decided to offer a 15-20 per cent concession on coal, iron ore and steel over long distances. For short-distance traffic, the concessions range from 10-50 per cent, except coal and iron ore. While the railways is considering more sops, carrying coal over shorter distances such as less than 100 km is unlikely to be viable.

With barely any passenger traffic, Eastern Railways is gradually picking up freight loading since June.
“April and May were lean  periods for us. From June, we have seen a growth in freight loading. August was on a par with last year as some of the coal mines were flooded. With industry picking up, the numbers are expected to go up and we expect to surpass the target for the year,” said Suneet Sharma, general manager, Eastern Railways.",business
LVMH-Tiffany deal off," The $16.2-billion deal that would have brought together LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Company, which would have been the biggest acquisition ever in the luxury sector, is cratering.
On Wednesday, LVMH said it was withdrawing its offer to buy Tiffany, while Tiffany said it had filed a lawsuit to force the luxury giant to move forward with its offer.
There has been concern for months that LVMH would seek to renegotiate the deal, which was announced last November, in light of the stress the pandemic has put on the jewellery business.
LVMH said in statement on Wednesday that it couldn’t complete the deal “as it stands”, citing a request from the French government to delay the deal beyond January 6, 2021, because of the threat of US tariffs on French goods.
In a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission, Tiffany said that while LVMH had informed the jeweller that it had received a letter from the French government to delay the deal, the company had not yet seen a copy of that letter.
Tiffany’s lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on Wednesday, claims that LVMH is in breach of its contract relating to obtaining antitrust clearance. It rejects the idea that LVMH can avoid the deal by claiming that Tiffany has undergone a “material adverse effect” that would have breached its deal obligations. The lawsuit also says that LVMH cannot avoid completing the deal because it is inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French company.
Tiffany decided to sue LVMH over frustration that 10 months after the agreement, it had not yet filed for antitrust approval in the European Union, a source said.
The proposed acquisition appeared to be a savvy move by LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods company by sales.",business
Texmaco Rail shelves rights issue," Texmaco Rail and Engineering on Wednesday said that it will not proceed with a proposed rights issue amid the crash in the economy. Instead its promoters will infuse Rs 200 crore through a preferential allotment.
Texmaco said its board had met on Tuesday and decided to call off the rights issue because its share price had fallen since the rights were announced in April. “In view of the impracticality of the issue now, the board has decided not to proceed with the rights issue.”
On the BSE, Texmaco shares fell to Rs 37 on Wednesday compared with a 52-week high of Rs 56.15.
The gross revenue of the Adventz group firm, headed by Saroj Kumar Poddar, for the April-June quarter was Rs 225 crore compared with Rs 399 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.
Net loss during the quarter was Rs 27 crore compared with a profit of Rs 10 crore in the corresponding period previous year.

Eveready net jumps on cost check," Eveready Industries has posted a three-fold increase in net profit in the first quarter of the year, backed by a sharp drop in raw material prices, better product mix and stringent cost control.
The storage cell battery maker recorded a profit of Rs 23.61 crore in April-June of 2020-21 compared with Rs 6.85 crore earned in the same period last year even as the operating income went down 18 per cent to Rs 263.45 crore from Rs 321.04 crore on a like-to-like basis.
Battery and flashlight, the mainstay of Eveready’s business, did well in the month of May and June where volumes were higher by 12 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, over the same period last year.

“We have been able to contain cost and also sell premium category products (in battery) with higher margins. The results were achieved despite April being a washout,” Amritanshu Khaitan, managing director of Eveready, said.
A higher demand for batteries was accounted by two factors —depleted inventory in the distribution chain because of the prolonged lockdown in the economy and a continuous fall of cheap Chinese import.

Silver Lake first to bet on RIL Retail," An investor rush is on way in Reliance Industries’ retail business — just as a bevy of marquee names flocked to its digital arm amid the economic mayhem triggered by the pandemic.
A beginning was made on Wednesday when Reliance announced US private equity firm Silver Lake Partners will pick up 1.75 per cent in Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd for Rs 7,500 crore. Silver Lake is likely to be followed by KKR, which is reportedly in advanced talks to invest around $1.5 billion as Mukesh Ambani looks to lay the marker for Jeff Bezos’s Amazon and Walmart-led Flipkart in India.
Silver Lake’s investment values Reliance Retail Ventures at a pre-money equity value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore, its second-billion dollar investment in a Reliance subsidiary after its $1.35 billion investment in Jio Platforms announced earlier this year.
As much as Rs 1.52 lakh crore has been invested by 13 investors in Jio Platforms, the RIL subsidiary for digital services, and market circles are not ruling out the possibility of some of them picking up stakes in the retail arm as well.
Speculation is rife on Facebook and Google’s interest as they try to create a base for their payment platforms, to be followed by others such as General Atlantic and Mubadala.

It is learnt that all the 13 investors in Jio Platforms have been offered a chance to invest in the retail unit.
“We believe technology will be key to bringing the much-needed transformation in this sector so that various constituents of the retail ecosystem can collaborate to build inclusive growth platforms. Silver Lake will be an invaluable partner in implementing our vision for Indian Retail,’’ Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, said.
While RIL had used the proceeds from the transactions in Jio Platforms to largely retire debt, it is now likely to plough the money in retail to scale up the business, more particularly the e-commerce operations in food and grocery as it looks to integrate more small shops.
The announcement of the deal led to RIL shares settling 2.57 per cent higher at Rs 2,161.25 on the BSE. RIL has a market capitalisation of around Rs 14.24 lakh crore if one was to include the partly paid shares.
The transaction has also thrown up questions on whether RIL is adequately valued at the current market price or is there is more upside in the stock.
Amid differences, analysts have put the sum-of-parts valuation of the various businesses at around Rs 16 lakh crore: over Rs 4 lakh crore for the oil-to-chemicals business, Rs 4.2 lakh crore for retail, Rs 6 lakh crore for Jio Platforms and cash in books of over $1 billion. Going by this estimate, there could be only some upside left in the stock.
While the latest transaction values Reliance Retail at over $58 billion post investment, it is below the estimate of brokerages such as CLSA.
The brokerage said the deal value of Rs 4.21 lakh crore is 12 per cent lower than the Rs 4.77 lakh crore equity value assigned in its September 2021 target price.
The brokerage has a sum-of-parts-valuation of Rs 14.32 lakh crore: Rs 4.7 lakh crore for O2C business, Rs 4.62 lakh crore (excluding the minority interest) for Jio, Rs 4.7 lakh crore for the retail business and Rs 44,700 crore as the value of other business minus debt.
On the other hand, BofA Securities has a fair value of Rs 15.92 lakh crore on Reliance Industries minus debt and other payables of Rs 58,600 crore. It has an enterprise value of Rs 11.70 lakh crore on the consumer business and Rs 5.51 lakh crore on the other business.",business
Clamour for stimulus to kick start demand," The government needs to go in for a major fiscal push on the demand side to return to positive growth trajectory, according to an industry survey released on Wednesday.
“In the absence of a major fiscal push on the demand side, we could end up being stuck in a quagmire of low demand and low-income cycle. If we have to return to the positive growth trajectory, the time for bold and decisive action is now,” Ficci president Sangita Reddy said.
Reddy said reviving the economy requires sustained efforts, especially when we have seen that in the first quarter, the gross domestic product (GDP) has suffered a major blow. In May, the government had announced a new financial package of over Rs 20 lakh crore.
The Ficci-Dhruva Advisors survey, conducted in August among 166 firms, showed that some of their operational parameters were improving as the economy is progressively opening up in phases.
However, improvement in performance on a sustained basis will have to wait, Ficci said.
Dhruva Advisors LLP chief executive Dinesh Kanabar said the survey results were a reflection of the gradual improvement in the Indian economy after the staggered unlocking.
“In the next phase, it is imperative that the critical business parameters continue to improve and are fast-tracked with government support and stimulus,” Kanabar said. He added that this would help the overall economy to grow.
The chamber said the government and regulatory institutions must continue to lend strength to businesses through all possible measures as well as improve those already announced based on feedback from stakeholders.
The survey respondents felt additional cash transfers for migrant workers, the poor and farmers, a temporary reduction in GST rates, an increase in government procurement; front-ending infrastructure projects and part-funding of wages would help.
They also suggested that the Centre must come out with a uniform policy for entry of tourists across various states as movement of people will promote regional economies.
In case of pending dues from a government entity, either the government should release the funds against the bank guarantee which will be part of the restructuring programme or the government should guarantee the release of these funds, they suggested.
Hospitality, tourism, retail, healthcare, real estate and aviation sectors need a special package, said the surveyed companies. India’s travel and tourism industry and the entire value chain is likely to lose around Rs 5 lakh crore, or $65.57 billion, because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Hotel occupancy is likely to be at 30 per cent till early next year, according to a study by CII and hospitality consulting firm Hotelivate.
The figures are quite alarming and the industry needs immediate measures for survival, the report says.",business
"Covid: Travel & tourism industry likely to lose around Rs 5 lakh cr, says study","   The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a crippling blow to the Indian travel and tourism industry. The entire value chain linked to the sector is likely to lose around Rs 5 lakh crore or USD 65.57 billion, according to a study by industry chamber CII and hospitality consulting firm Hotelivate.
The organised sector alone is likely to lose USD 25 billion. The figures are quite alarming and the industry needs immediate measures for survival, according to the report from CII-Hotelivate.
""This is the one of the worst crises to ever hit the Indian tourism industry impacting all its geographical segments - inbound, outbound and domestic, almost all tourism verticals - leisure , adventure, heritage, MICE, cruise, corporate and niche segments,"" it said.
The shut down and slowdown, initially expected to affect revenue streams till October, have now indicated otherwise. Trends are currently indicating that only 30 per cent of occupancy in hotels till the start of next year, with hotels seeing an 80 to 85 per cent erosion in revenue streams, it said.

According to the study, occupancy was at its peak in January this year at 80 per cent followed by February at 70 per cent, dipping to 45 per cent in March and then to the lowest at 7 per cent in April.
In May, June, July and August occupancies were at 10 per cent, 12 per cent, 15 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, it added.
The CII-Hotelivate study has projected that the occupancy in September will be 25 per cent, 28 per cent in October, 30 per cent in November and 35 per cent in December.
In a worst case scenario, the estimated loss in hotel for both branded and unbranded segments in 2020 is USD 19.31 billion (around Rs 1.42 lakh crore), it added.
On the other hand, the report said the estimated revenue loss of travel agents and tour operators in a worst case scenario is USD 4.77 billion (about Rs 35,070 crore).
However, in the best-case scenario, industry revenue will improve by 10-15 per cent, said the report, to which online travel services MakeMyTrip also contributed.",business

GST voting ignores majority," The number of states opposed to the Centre’s GST compensation policy far outnumber those in favour, but a tilted voting rule may see the Centre carry the day at the GST council meeting on Thursday, if a ballot is held on the contentious issue.
The seven-day window for states to give their opinion on the Centre’s proposal to borrow from the market and recover their compensation cess dues is now over.
Ten states including Punjab and Bengal are opposed to the idea of state borrowing and would prefer the Centre to do so and pass on the proceeds to the states.
The GST Council will meet on Thursday to take a call on borrowing, The Centre can swing the decision in its favour with a one-third vote share in case of division.
The states have been given two options: borrow Rs 97,000 crore to meet the shortfall arising because of GST implementation; or borrow Rs 2.35 lakh crore which includes the Rs 1.38 lakh crore that the Centre has refused to pay as this is attributed to Covid-related factors.

The ten states opposing the two options are Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Telangana, Pondicherry, Kerala and Bengal.
Of the 31 states, 17 states have spelt out their stand.
Four  states are in favour of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore — Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tripura, while Manipur and Sikkim are in favour of the second option.  Karnataka has stated that it is ready to borrow but has not so far disclosed which option it would opt for.
Given the growing opposition to the borrowing plans, it is likely the issue could be settled through voting at the council meeting.
However, the Centre can bulldoze its way. Not just because most of the states are ruled by the BJP, but, the way the voting itself is structured.
The rules specify that the weight of the Centre shall be 1/3rd of the total weight of the votes cast. So, among the members who cast their votes, the Centre’s vote is assigned a weight of 1/3 while the rest 2/3 is distributed to the states’ voting.
The Centre has justified the borrowing by states in view the prevailing economic situation where its revenues were under greater strain than state GST revenues.",business

Two men snap up top brands," It has been a prolonged period of retail carnage: storied names declaring bankruptcy, mass market brands closing thousands of stores, tens of thousands of shop employees furloughed or laid off, garment workers in dire straits. More ominous still are the predictions that we will never shop the same way again.
For Jamie Salter and David Simon, however, it has been a time of great opportunity.
Salter is the founder and chief executive of the Authentic Brands Group, a company known for buying the intellectual property of famous brands at discount prices and then striking licensing deals with other companies that want to stick those well-known names on their products.
Simon is the chief executive of Simon Property Group, the largest mall operator in the United States with more than 100 properties. Together, they are reshaping the American retail landscape.
Last week, they closed a deal to buy the bankrupt Brooks Brothers, the 202-year-old American fashion brand and retailer, for $325 million. Last month, they acquired Lucky Brand denim, and in February, they bought Forever 21.

Big-hitter Knights face slot riddle," Andre Russell’s batting position had been the topic of debate in the lead-up to this IPL. So much so that Kolkata Knight Riders’ head coach Brendon McCullum had gone on record saying that they would have to strategically consider pushing the all-rounder up in the batting order in some of the matches.
Yet on Wednesday, during their opener against Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi, the KKR think-tank decided to send Russell in at No. 6 when faced with a target of 196.
McCullum’s use of resources while formulating the batting order did hamper their chase to a certain extent. When the need of the hour was big-hitters at the start to set the tempo, they ended up sending the captain Dinesh Karthik and Nitish Rana at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively.
The explosive Eoin Morgan and Russell followed and by the time the pair joined hands in the 12th over, the asking rate was close to 15 an over.
KKR seemed not to have learnt from their mistakes in 2019 when similar instances of not giving Russell enough overs in hand during a big run-chase cost them a few matches. The Jamaican with 510 runs off only 249 deliveries was not only their highest run-scorer last season but also had the tournament’s best strike-rate of 204.81.

“When you’re chasing a big target, then your big-hitters should come up the order,” batting legend Sunil Gavaskar said during a TV show. “We saw this even in the Chennai Super Kings’ chase against Rajasthan Royals — after Sam Curran, MS Dhoni should have come in. Likewise, if Andre Russell came in at No. 4 and Eoin Morgan at No. 5, then it would have made a difference.”
When Russell walked in, KKR needed 120 off 50 balls. But by then Mumbai Indians’ pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult and James Pattinson had a firm grip on the match and effectively shut KKR’s case.
It’s not that Russell has lost his touch. He scored 222 in eight innings at a strike rate of 141.40 for Jamaica Tallawahs in the recently concluded Caribbean Premier League.
For someone as aggressive as McCullum, such strategy seemed inexplicable. The decision to send Rana at No.4 also didn’t work since the conditions demanded someone with abilities to clear a big ground as in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. Had it been Sharjah, Rana wouldn’t have been dismissed caught near the ropes by Hardik Pandya since the smaller boundaries would have come to his rescue.
Such intricate planning of strategy should be the focus of the backroom staff and given the nature of the fast-paced game would depend on the match situation. Alarmingly, KKR’s chase never took off against Rohit Sharma’s men.
Karthik tried to stay clear of talk surrounding the batting order at the post-match media conference. “It all depends on the game and what score we are chasing. The advantage with our batting is we are very fluid,” the KKR captain said.",sports
Frank Lampard’s praise for Kai Havertz," Chelsea manager Frank Lampard was impressed by Kai Havertz’s performance on Wednesday after he netted a hat-trick in their 6-0 League Cup win over Barnsley at Stamford Bridge and said it was just the first of many great nights to come from him.
Havertz struggled in Premier League games against Brighton and Hove Albion and Liverpool but showed why Chelsea spent $90 million to get him from Bayer Leverkusen.
“We had to play him because we had a few injuries...The combinations he had with Tammy Abraham and the three goals were impressive,” Lampard said.

Luis Suarez bids adieu to Barcelona," Luis Suarez highlighted his close friendship with Lionel Messi as he bid a teary farewell to Barcelona on Thursday ahead of his move to La Liga title rivals Atletico Madrid.
Messi had failed to dovetail with other top strikers such as Samuel Eto’o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Villa but took no time at all to gel with Suarez, who became his best friend at the club as well as a prolific strike partner.
“When I got to Barcelona everyone said be careful with Leo, that he was the main striker at the club,” an emotional Suarez said at a media conference attended by Messi and fellow Barca teammates Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba.
“But in our time together we always tried to perform as well as we could and I can leave here feeling very proud.”
Messi also looked set to be leaving Barca before walking back on his threat to end his contract unilaterally, and Suarez lashed out at the stories that appeared in the media about the two players’ influence on the club.

“It has been a crazy month, many things have been said and leaked that were invented, many things that made me angry. But everyone knows how good a relationship I have with Leo,” Suarez added.                                         ",sports
"Rahul leads from front, Kohli falters"," As KL Rahul butchered the Royal Challengers Bangalore bowlers, his “idol” Virat Kohli watched helplessly, stunned to the extent that he, with one of the safest pair of hands in contemporary cricket, even dropped two catches. Ironically, it was Rahul whom he dropped. 
In the end, led by Rahul, Kings XI Punjab thumped Kohli’s men by 97 runs, at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.
Rahul (132 not out off 69 balls), albeit aided by the two reprieves he had late in the Kings XI innings after they were put in to bat, played one of his finest knocks at this level, smashing 14 boundaries and seven maximums that powered his team to 206/3, a total that didn’t look quite possible after the 15th over, especially when they lost power-hitter Glenn Maxwell, who was once again dismissed cheaply.
But Rahul took the onus upon himself and unleashed his fury on the opponent bowlers. The last two overs of their innings yielded Kings XI as many as 49 with Rahul alone hammering 42 of those.
In reply, all that Royal Challengers could manage was a paltry 109 in 17 overs. Their hopes had faded to a large extent when Sheldon Cottrell and Mohammed Shami had them reeling at 4/3 in the third over, and that too with skipper Kohli back in the dugout having scored just one.
After the high of beginning the IPL with a convincing win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, it turned out to be an absolutely forgettable outing for Kohli on the field. Off the field earlier in the day, Kohli had a virtual interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about how the Yo-Yo tests helped Indian cricketers aim for higher-level fitness.
Modi was interacting with fitness experts and influencers from across the country to mark the one-year anniversary of the ‘Fit India Movement’. The Prime Minister also jested with Kohli during the interaction, saying the skipper’s dedication towards fitness and maintaining a healthy diet have brought great loss to Delhi’s chole bhature sellers.
But later in the evening, the loss was all Kohli’s. Before completely miscuing one off the bowling of Cottrell during the Royal Challengers’ reply, he shelled two relatively easy catches to let Rahul off in the 17th and 18th overs of the Kings XI innings. And then rubbing salt to Kohli and his team’s wounds, Rahul launched that assault in the last two overs that gave Kings XI a huge momentum.
Even someone of Dale Steyn’s stature was clobbered for 26 in the penultimate over of the Kings XI innings, with Rahul scoring each of those runs. Shivam Dube then went for 23 in the final over, with Rahul finishing the innings with back-to-back sixes.
Royal Challengers certainly needed another brisk start from their openers Devdutt Padikkal and Aaron Finch. But Cottrell’s pace turned out to be tougher to deal with for young Padikkal, who could last only two balls on this occasion.
Shami made fine use of the seam at the other end and had no problems whatsoever to pick up promising Aussie keeper-batsman Josh Philippe — promoted up the order to No. 3 — trapping him leg-before.
After Kohli’s departure, Finch and AB de Villiers had an Everest to climb. De Villiers did try and put up a resistance, but Kings XI’s leg-spin duo of Ravi Bishnoi (3/32) and Murugan Ashwin (3/21) ensured they kept tightening the screws. Both Bishnoi and Murugan relied mostly on the googly, which helped them account for Finch and De Villiers, respectively.
“I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it. (Dropped chances) Cost about 30-40 runs. If we had restricted them to 180, we wouldn’t have felt the pressure to have a go from ball one.
“There are days when you have these things happening... Just have to accept them,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.",sports
"Eye on MS Dhoni, poser on Ashwin"," Will Mahendra Singh Dhoni bat up the order or again go in at No. 7? That certainly will be an area of interest when Chennai Super Kings face a confident Delhi Capitals in their third game of this IPL at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.
Dhoni did draw a bit of flak for pushing himself lower down the order when CSK were chasing a daunting target of 217 versus Rajasthan Royals in their previous game. And when he did arrive in the middle, he scored only nine off the first 12 balls he faced, leaving Faf du Plessis to do the job all alone, which was rather impossible as the batters before contributed few runs.
The Dubai pitch isn’t quite a batting belter like that of Sharjah, which suggests the Super Kings need to be careful about sorting out their batting order. Coach Stephen Fleming, however, remains optimistic that Dhoni will do better as the tournament progresses.
“As the tournament goes on, MS will just get better and better. To come in and expect him to get a 30-ball 70 would be a tough ask and we’ve other players also who are in good form and can do a job.
“So, it’s valuing what each player can do and also respecting that Dhoni is one of a kind when he’s in form,” he said.
For Delhi Capitals, winning a cliffhanger right at the onset seems to have given them a lot of confidence, though Ravichandran Ashwin’s availability remains uncertain. Mohammed Kaif, the team’s assistant coach, said on match eve a decision on Ashwin’s inclusion would be taken before the game starts. “Our physio Patrick Farhart will take a call on the matter,” Kaif said.
Senior spinner Amit Mishra, who has taken plenty of wickets in the IPL, could be an option to partner Axar Patel if Ashwin is unable to make it.
The Super Kings batsmen didn’t look too comfortable against the Royals tweakers the other night. So if Ashwin does play, Shreyas Iyer and Co. may find themselves with a good opportunity to make perfect use of the situation.
The good news for CSK is Dwayne Bravo progressing well after missing the first two matches due to injury.",sports
"Dean of innovation, doyen of grit"," Dean Jones, a trend-setting one-day cricketer whose career defining innings was, however, a double hundred in treacherous conditions in the Madras Tied Test in 1986, died of a cardiac arrest in Mumbai on Thursday. He was 59 and is survived by his wife and two daughters.
Jones was part of the Star Sports commentary team for the IPL, a tournament he never played in but one he would possibly have excelled in given his range of power shots, ability to improvise, quick running between the wickets and electrifying fielding.
Jones, it is learnt, had breakfast in his hotel on Thursday morning and attended a pre-match briefing session with his fellow pundits. He is believed to have suffered the cardiac arrest in the lobby.
Brett Lee, the former Australia fast bowler, attempted to revive Jones. His death was later confirmed at a hospital in south Mumbai.
“It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing away of Mr. Dean Mervyn Jones AM. He died of a sudden cardiac arrest,” Star Sports said in a press release.

Jones played in 52 Tests for Australia between 1984 and 1992, scoring 3631 runs at an average of 46.55 with 11 centuries. But it was as an innovator in one-day cricket that Jones, his lips lined with zinc cream, will perhaps best be remembered. He pioneered an aggressive, fleet-footed approach to batting that fetched him 6068 runs in 164 matches at an average of 44.61 with seven hundreds and 46 fifties. He was also part of Australia’s 1987 World Cup-winning team.
Jones burst on to the cricketing centrestage in the first game of the World Championship of Cricket in February 1985 when he, along with Robbie Kerr, put on an entertaining 157-run partnership for the fourth wicket to take Australia to victory against England. Kerr scored 87 not out and Jones made a 94-ball 78 that was marked by powerful shots all around the wicket at the MCG, dancing down the pitch to fast bowlers, and quick running, traits that were still alien to many in ODI cricket of the time.
But his most famous moment would come a year later in the historic Tied Test at Chepauk in Chennai (then Madras), where he battled extreme heat and physical exhaustion to notch a memorable 210 in over eight hours.
So severely dehydrated was Jones that he threw up on a few occasions while batting and had to be admitted to a hospital during the course of the match for intravenous drips.
Allan Border, then Australia’s captain, paid tribute to Jones as “one of the greatest natural cricketers” who, he said, “revolutionised” the game.
How Border had spurred on Jones, a proud Victorian, during the Chepauk innings is also part of cricketing folklore.
When Jones was clearly struggling during his epic knock, Border, batting at the other end, suggested that Queenslander Greg Ritchie — the next batsman in — would be better equipped to handle the stifling conditions.
“I knew Greg Ritchie was in next, and I knew there would be some easy quip I could make to fire him up, so I said, ‘Yeah well that’s okay mate, if you want to go off now we’ll get someone out here tough, we’ll get a Queenslander out here’,” Border would later recall.
“He did stay on… and the legend was born.”
Jones was more or less a fixture in the Test team from then until 1992, an integral part of Australia’s evolution from frequent humiliation to the cusp of global domination. He notched up his highest Test score of 216 against Viv Richards’ West Indies, which had a bowling attack comprising Marshall, Ambrose, Walsh and Patterson, in Adelaide in 1989. A year later, he hit a hundred in each innings (116 and 121 n.o.) against Imran Khan’s Pakistan at the same venue.
His prowess in one-day cricket continued as Jones became arguably one of Australia’s most beloved and popular entertainers, never more so than at his beloved MCG. But somewhere along the way his Test career suffered and he was dropped for the first Test against the West Indies at the Gabba in November 1992, a place he was never to regain.
In January 1993, Jones was engaged in a duel with Ambrose when he asked the big pacer to take his white wristbands off during an ODI at the SCG. Ambrose retaliated by bowing one of the most fiery spells in cricket in that match and in the subsequent games.
A year later, in 1994, Jones played his last ODI.
In his post retirement life he performed the role of a cricket analyst for various channels, primarily in South Asia — India and Pakistan, where he was immensely popular. One of the Indian news channels named him “Professor Deano”, a moniker that stuck with him and was also his Twitter handle. He could polarise opinion and would often get trolled, even on Wednesday he had a social media exchange with a critic of his commentary. He also once courted controversy for calling Hashim Amla “terrorist” on air, a light-hearted comment but the racist undertone forced the particular broadcaster to take him off air. Jones later admitted it was a “silly and insensitive” comment to make.
Jones also had two spells coaching teams in the Pakistan Super League, winning the title in 2016 and 2018 with Islamabad United.
Among a raft of past and current players to pay tribute on social media, former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar said he was heartbroken. “A wonderful soul taken away too soon,” Tendulkar said.
Ramiz Raja, who worked with Jones as a co-commentator, said the news had left him in complete shock.
“One of a kind you were Deano and how lonely and helpless you must have felt on your own in that hotel room - a death we commentators fear the most, and likely to meet, helpless and gone in that hotel room... RIP my friend,” Raja tweeted.  ",sports
Damir Dzumhur threatens legal action against French Tennis Federation," Bosnian player Damir Dzumhur is planning to take the French Tennis Federation to court after he was ejected from the French Open’s qualifying event because his coach tested positive for Covid-19.
According to a report in L’Equipe, Dzumhur is frustrated because his coach, Petar Popovic, contracted Covid-19 in the summer and he believes he is still showing the remains of antibodies. On his return to Serbia, Popovic was tested again and came up negative.
“It’s a scandal and a huge frustration,” Dzumhur said. “I’m sure we’ll win in court, but it hurts a lot.”
The news comes on top of a rocky start to the French Open, which starts in earnest on Sunday. Six players have already been withdrawn from this week’s qualifying because of positive Covid-19 tests.
Behind the scenes, players and coaches have reported a less sophisticated operation than the one run by the United States Tennis Association in New York this month. “Organisation-wise, it is not at the same level,” said the American player Noah Rubin on his Behind the Racquet podcast.

There are also informal reports of the French federation taking a high-handed approach to those who object to the way the qualifying event has been run. According to one source: “Their general attitude is that they are doing the players a favour by staging the event at all.”
In his podcast, Rubin highlighted his concerns about the lack of an immediate quarantine for those arriving at Roland Garros. “You didn’t get a test as soon as you walked into the bubble,” he said. “Players showed up on Wednesday, actually hit on site that day, went out to dinner in Paris, then got a test on Thursday. That just doesn’t make that much sense to me.”
Rubin also said that he had not played a warm-up tournament to arrive in good time. “We know how long it takes for Covid to get into someone’s system or to test positive. For some players to come maybe less than 48 hours before their first match, you’re rolling the dice.”
The US Open created ill-feeling among a group of players — the so-called “Paire 11” — who were confined to their rooms in New York after spending time with the French player Benoit Paire, who then tested positive. Those worst affected were probably Kristina Mladenovic and her partner Timea Babos —  the top seeds in the women’s doubles —  who were ordered to remain in their hotel in Long Island by public health officials, and thus had to concede their second-round match without taking to the court.

English Football and National League Clubs’ fiscal health alarm," More than 10 English Football League and National League clubs could go bust after the return of fans in those divisions was scrapped, a leading football finance expert has warned.
Kieran Maguire, a lecturer in the subject at the University of Liverpool, made the grim forecast after publishing data showing every club in the Championship and all but two in the Premier League would have made operating losses in the season before last had they been deprived of match-day income. Data also showed all but seven sides in League One, five in League Two and three in the National League — many of which do not file detailed accounts — lost money in the same season.
Charlton, Wigan, Oldham and Southend have all previously been identified as being at risk of going to the wall, even before the coronavirus crisis struck, while Gillingham chairman Paul Scally on Tuesday warned his own club could do so by Christmas if supporters remained locked out of grounds.
Maguire said: “There is a danger of a trickle becoming far more than a trickle. Potentially, we could be hitting double figures. If you take a look at the worst years pre-financial fair play, we were seeing around 2003, 2004, seven, eight, nine clubs going into administration, partly on the back of ITV Digital’s collapse.
“What we are facing at present is a far greater hit to the professional sport sector. How can clubs in the National League survive if they can’t play matches in front of a paying audience when 60 per cent or more of their money comes through the turnstiles?...
“Charlton’s very worrying because there’s presently an injunction against the person that wants to buy the club and somebody else who wants to buy the club who has been rejected by the EFL,” he said.

IPL: Kolkata Knight Riders beaten on all fronts," Kolkata Knight Riders got off to a disastrous start in their opener against Mumbai Indians at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Wednesday.
Dinesh Karthik’s men were outplayed and outmanoeuvred in all departments of the game during their 49-run thrashing. In reply to Mumbai Indians’ imposing total of 195 for 5, KKR could manage only 146 for 9.
This was Mumbai Indians’ 20th win over KKR.
Barring winning the toss and dismissing Quinton de Kock early in the second over of the game, nothing fell in place for KKR. The defending champions thus made a superb comeback after a loss in the opener versus CSK.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma led from the front, top-scoring with a 54-ball 80 — a knock studded with three fours and six over-boundaries. Rohit was severe on the KKR bowler who was expected to bring in the “fear factor” to the opposition — Pat Cummins.
Cummins, however, did perform with the bat, smashing Mumbai Indians’ trump card Jasprit Bumrah for four sixes in the 18th over, which to an extent reduced the margin of their defeat.
There were tactical blunders that ruined KKR’s day. Rohit’s weaknesses against Sunil Narine have been well documented in the IPL, but the off-spinner was brought into the attack only when the Mumbai Indians skipper was well set.
KKR’s ploy of opening the attack with Sandeep Warrier and Shivam Mavi failed to yield any significant result. Perhaps Cummins could have done a better job with the new ball.
During the chase, Nitish Rana was sent ahead of Morgan, which was bizarre to say the least, especially after the openers had fallen cheaply. When Morgan came on to bat, after captain Karthik’s dismissal, he had just too much to do with the required run rate soaring above 14.",sports
"Pretty rusty day, admits Dinesh Karthik"," Kolkata Knight Riders captain Dinesh Karthik admitted it was a disappointing performance in their IPL opener on Wednesday.
“I think we had areas to do well in bat and ball. It was a pretty rusty day to be honest...  I don’t want to get too analytical about it, but the boys realise they could have done better,” Karthik said after the 49-run loss.
“Pat Cummins and Eoin Morgan just finished their quarantine today. So it is not easy to come in and play in this heat,” he remarked.
Karthik evaded a query about a change in their top-order, saying: “I haven’t had the conversation about that with Baz (coach Brendon McCullum) but will let you know by the next game”.

Return to court helped Novak Djokovic," Italian Open champion Novak Djokovic said getting back on court for a tournament so quickly after being disqualified at the US Open for striking a line judge with a ball helped him move on from the incident.
The world No. 1 came in for heavy criticism at Flushing Meadows earlier this month and the Serb said he spent several days processing what had happened.
He returned to tournament play in Rome last week and captured his 36th ATP Masters crown in Monday’s final by beating Argentine Diego Schwartzman 7-5, 6-3.
“I did experience mentally some ups and downs in the first four-five days after that (US Open incident) happened,” Djokovic told reporters.
“Obviously I was in shock... but I moved on, I’ve never had an issue in my life to move on regardless of how difficult it is.

“Obviously playing a tournament a week after helped a lot. Being on court helped. I really wanted to get on the court and get whatever trace of that out of the way.”

“I don’t think I played my best tennis to be honest, I don’t want to sound arrogant here. I am very satisfied and pleased to win a title,” he added.
“Hopefully, I’ll be able to raise that level for the French Open because that’s going to be necessary if I want to go deep in the tournament.”",sports
We controlled the game: Pep Guardiola," Manchester City got their Premier League campaign off to a flying start with a 3-1 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers, thanks to first-half goals by Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden plus a late Gabriel Jesus strike on Monday.
The result means there has not been a single drawn match in the opening two rounds of Premier League fixtures and the 44 goals over a single ‘game week’ is a record for the 20-team era.
Wolves beat City home and away last season but Pep Guardiola’s side were full value for their victory despite a strong response from the home side after they went 2-0 down.
Guardiola gave a debut to close-season signing Nathan Ake, the Dutch defender signed from Bournemouth, lining up alongside John Stones in the centre of defence.
While City were given a rest in the first week of the season, due to their August involvement in the Champions League, they were sharp out of the blocks, quickly finding their rhythm.

 “Wolves have been a bit of a bogey team for us in the last few seasons. So it’s encouraging to play well,” De Bruyne said.
City will draft in players from the club’s youth academy for Thursday’s League Cup match at home to Bournemouth with manager Pep Guardiola saying he did not have the squad size to compete in two competitions at this stage of the campaign.
“Against Bournemouth we will play most players from the academy and try to keep energy in the Premier League. With the lack of preparation and seven players out, we have to keep the players who played today as fresh as possible,” he said.
 City were without several key players at Wolves with Ilkay Guendogan missing after testing positive for Covid-19 and Sergio Aguero and Aymeric Laporte ruled out in advance with injuries.
Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Eric Garcia were also sidelined after picking up injuries in training meaning three young players were on the bench.
 “The period that we are in and the situation that we had in these last two weeks, I expect that in some moments we suffer, but in general we controlled the game,” said Guardiola.
“Everyone was ready and did well. It was important (to start like this) but of course it is just one game.” Aston Villa belatedly got their season up and running with a laboured 1-0 home win against 10-man Sheffield United on Monday as Ezri Konsa’s second-half header proved enough to settle a dour game at Villa Park.",sports
Rajasthan Royals prevail in battle of sixes against Chennai Super Kings," Sanju Samson’s breathtaking knock made all the difference in the end as the Rajasthan Royals, even without some of their top players, stunned Chennai Super Kings by 16 runs at the Sharjah Stadium on Tuesday to begin their IPL XIII campaign on a winning note.
In a high-scoring game where batsmen made the most of a friendly pitch, the Royals posted a massive 216/7 after being put in to bat. In reply, the Super Kings could manage 200 for the loss of six wickets in 20 overs. The match saw 33 sixes.
Samson (74 off 32 balls) alone smashed nine of the 17 sixes in the Royals’ innings. Being severe on anything that was pitched up, particularly by Piyush Chawla and Ravindra Jadeja, he targeted mostly the straight boundaries that were short.
Along with that blazing knock, Samson also took two catches and effected as many stumpings, having a perfect day as a ’keeper-batsman. Captain Steve Smith (69 off 47 balls) too gave Samson excellent support at the other end. The Super Kings did pull things back a bit in the middle overs, but Jofra Archer (27 not out off 8 balls) hammered Lungi Ngidi for four maximums in the final over of the Royals innings which yielded as many as 30 runs.
Pressure was on the Super Kings from the first over of their reply and barring Faf du Plessis (72 off 37 balls), the others could hardly wage a battle.
Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit three maximums in the last over to remain unbeaten on 29, but it was baffling why he came in so late, at No.7, when his team faced a tall task.",sports
Boult backs Bumrah’s potential," Trent Boult has backed Jasprit Bumrah to bounce back strongly against Kolkata Knight Riders in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
The India pace spearhead had a rare off-day going for 43 runs off his four overs in the tournament opener.
“He (Bumrah) is a world class bowler, he is trying very hard over the last couple of days to find rhythm. I am 100 per cent sure he will be on the mark in the coming games,” Boult said.
“He is a big player for us and a very important bowler and I am sure he will bounce back very nicely.”
Boult is hoping to forge a successful partnership with Bumrah in MI’s bowling attack. “Yes, the opportunity to bowl with Bumrah and the other guys in the bowling attack is very exciting and a good opportunity to learn. And yes Bumrah is a guy, who is very experienced and he has got some amazing skills and I’m really looking forward to hopefully having some success with him,” he said.
The 31-year-old left-arm pacer, who returned with figures of 1/23 against CSK, was satisfied with his own effort, even though MI failed to defend 163-run target.
“I think from my point of view personally — coming off from a big winter in New Zealand with lockdowns and isolations, I haven’t played cricket in probably six months -— I was pretty happy with the way I came out. Conditions are a lot different to what I face back home, with the heat and humidity here.”
He, however, said there were a couple of areas they needed to work on in the coming games.
“But we were a couple of (few) runs short in terms of our total to defend. We need to tighten up a couple of small areas with accuracy and execution,” he said.
He admitted that bowling in death overs was the biggest challenge in T20 cricket. “It is the biggest challenge to be honest. It is very difficult to come in and bowl the last couple of overs against batsmen who are set. (Faf) Du Plessis was set the other night on 50 or 60 runs and when guys are hitting from that platform, it is very hard to defend,” he said.",sports
Eoin Morgan keen to aid finisher Andre Russell," Eoin Morgan, with all the experience that he has gathered over the last few years, is ready to complement Andre Russell in finishing off games for the Kolkata Knight Riders during the ongoing IPL.
“I think with the squad that we have, it gives us a huge amount of options, particularly in terms of batting and bowling. We talked about Pat Cummins, who’s so versatile. I think within the squad, we have a number of very versatile cricketers who can specifically take care of the batting department. We have guys who can play a significant role.
“I know Andre Russell has played that role for a number of years now and done it exceptionally well. And if I get a go, hopefully, I’ll be able to aid that,” the England World Cup-winning captain said during an online interaction from Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
He expressed confidence in himself for having evolved into a better batsman with experience.
“It has been quite a few years since I last played in KKR (2013). Just looking at my batting, I think the last three to four years have been most successful. My game has come on really nicely and quite a lot. I have been more experienced coming into my groove as a batsman,” Morgan added.

Morgan has been praised highly by Knight Riders head coach Brendon McCullum and he spoke of the camaraderie that he shares with the former New Zealand captain.
“Of course, we’ve been very good friends for a number of years now. I think when the friendship started, we started enjoying when we found things in common, making memories together through enjoying those things. Certainly, there are a number of things linked in sport. Probably horse racing is the main one which both of us enjoy and there’s rugby as well.
“We have had great days out, both together and with families, and made some good memories. So yeah, we’re good mates,” Morgan said.",sports
McCullum finds Eden in UAE conditions," Contrary to general perception of wickets in the UAE being unfriendly to the pacers, the quicks have got some help from the pitches of Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the IPL so far and that makes Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) head coach Brendon McCullum optimistic about the impact that Pat Cummins could possibly have for his team.
Not just that, McCullum actually finds the conditions similar to Eden Gardens, KKR’s original home.
“The present conditions, and especially if we look back at the first few matches of this competition, are probably little bit similar to that of Eden Gardens because the UAE pitches have not been utilised over the last few months. They seem to have quite a bit of freshness in them.
“We’ve seen the fast bowlers excel, particularly those who operated in and around that Test match length. And if we look at Cummins, he’s the No. 1 bowler in Test cricket. Through a little bit of good fortune, we have landed in these conditions where his bowling should suit us,” McCullum said on the eve of KKR’s opening game in the IPL, against Mumbai Indians.
Hinting Shubman Gill and Sunil Narine could open the innings for KKR on Wednesday, captain Dinesh Karthik believes the former will “exceed all expectations”.

“The uncomplicated batting style of Narine makes things easy for us. As for Shubman, I’m sure he will exceed all expectations. Him and Narine are a unique opening pair and something we are really proud to have,” Karthik said.
Looking at the matches so far, Karthik agreed that a total of 160 or more could make things “interesting” in this IPL. “Having watched the games played so far, 160 appears to be a par score on most grounds. But there’s no reason why a higher total cannot be achieved or a lower total cannot be defended. It also depends on the pitch we play on.”",sports
IPL: Charge of the Knight brigade," Forget strategy or boardroom planning, if you are looking for pure talent and firepower, Kolkata Knight Riders have one of the most intimidating squads in this IPL.
Inconsistent batting and faulty team selection were mainly responsible for their failure to make the playoffs last season. The addition of Eoin Morgan and Pat Cummins, along with Tom Banton and Chris Green, is intended to plug those loopholes this time.
The strict quarantine rules in Abu Dhabi have kept Morgan and Cummins locked in their hotel rooms since their arrival on September 17. The team management though remained confident of their availability in the opener against Mumbai Indians, going by the IPL’s six-day quarantine period norm.
“I don’t think there’s any doubt about their availability. Good thing is from the captain and coach’s standpoint, all players would be available for selection. So over to them,” CEO Venky Mysore said during a virtual media conference on Tuesday.
None, however, knows who will have the final say on this issue — the IPL governing council or the Abu Dhabi government.

A power-packed batting line-up for both KKR and MI could make it an interesting tussle on Wednesday.
Besides having a settled opening pair in Shubman Gill and Sunil Narine, KKR possess multiple options for every position. They could experiment with Andre Russell at No.3 followed by Morgan and Dinesh Karthik. In the last two seasons, Russell had a strike-rate of 227 in the death overs with Karthik scoring at 187.
KKR also have a near 70 per cent success rate in the recent past while chasing. So the blend of experience and quality will make their batting quite formidable.
Morgan’s presence is sure to be a huge bonus since he has the ability to dictate the course of the match, be it attack or defend. MI will hope Rohit Sharma and Quinton de Kock fire at the top followed up by some solid attacking display by the likes of Saurabh Tiwary, Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard. The only way KKR can upset their gameplan is by dismissing Rohit early and piling on the pressure through Narine. The presence of Cummins, Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah along with the talented Kamlesh Nagarkoti could provide for some edge-of-the-seat excitement but it is the spinners who could decide the outcome. This is where KKR will enjoy a slight advantage.
KKR’s Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav possess the wizardry but how they come up against Rohit and Pollard will be crucial. If Narine can remain miserly in his four overs and Kuldeep regains the mystery element, MI will find the going tough.
Mumbai did miss a quality spinner in the middle overs in their opener and it remains to be seen if they decide to try out the talented leggie Prince Balwant Rai.
Bumrah did look rusty on Saturday and the sooner he regains his rhythm the better for MI. The powerplay overs could be the turning point in terms of picking wickets and restricting the batsmen. How the captains use their resources in the first six overs will be important. Rohit has always displayed out-of-the box ideas to surprise the batsmen but Karthik will have to live up to expectations. KKR picked just 16 wickets in the powerplays last season and need to better this record.
Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has already predicted that if KKR do not perform in the early stages, the management might replace Karthik with Morgan as captain. Karthik certainly knows that.",sports
Harbhajan’s praise & Rabada’s strategy," Our Bureau, Calcutta: Veteran India spinner Harbhajan Singh has praised the performance by Ambati Rayudu in the opening game of the 13th edition of Indian Premier League and said that he had deserved a spot in the World Cup squad last year.
“The partnership between Rayudu and (Faf) du Plessis was the game-changing moment for Chennai Super Kings. We have made a bright start and we need to keep moving forward like this,” Harbhajan said on a YouTube channel.
  PTI, Dubai: Marcus Stoinis’ all-round brilliance and Kagiso Rabada’s Super Over show helped Delhi Capitals beat Kings XI Punjab after both teams were tied on 157 in regulation time. Asked how he manages to pull off the Super Overs, Rabada said: “It just depends what works for me on the day. There’s decent bounce in this wicket, and the boundaries are quite big. It’ll take a bit to clear it.”

Kings XI Punjab appeal over ‘short run'," Kings XI Punjab have filed an appeal with Match Referee Javagal Srinath over umpire Nitin Menon’s “incorrect” line judgement that resulted in a “short run” call during a crucial phase of their match against Delhi Capitals in Dubai on Sunday.
KXIP lost in the Super Over after the match was tied at the end of 20 overs. The incident happened in the 19th over when Menon — who was stationed at square leg and has recently been included in the ICC Elite panel — ruled KXIP’s Chris Jordan to be one run short though TV replays showed that his bat was well within the crease when he completed the first run.
“We have appealed to the Match Referee saying that such an incident has taken place. You can also say we have informed him of it since nothing much can be done once the match ends.
“I understand this is a human error but it could cost us a playoff berth. This is unfair and we can only hope that the BCCI takes appropriate measures to avoid such things in future,” CEO Satish Menon told The Telegraph on Monday.
KXIP co-owner Ness Wadia was scathing in his assessment.“It is unfortunate that Kings XI were the subject of poor decision making by the umpire and this cost us the game. I do hope that BCCI implements a system and process so that the other teams do not suffer the same plight as Kings XI did...

“If technology is not there to be used for the fairness and transparency of the game and to ensure that it is equitable to all, then why use technology at all,” Wadia said.
According to the rules, the third umpire’s opinion can be sought for a possible dismissal or an unclear boundary. Front foot no-ball calls are also being monitored by the third umpire from this year.
However, there are doubts whether technology can always be considered fool-proof. “The cameras monitoring line calls often show varying results from different angles and cannot be considered conclusive. All these things have to be taken into account before a decision is taken,” said someone in the know of things.
Another co-owner and actress Preity Zinta tweeted: “I travelled enthusiastically during a pandemic,did 6 days of Quarantine & 5covid tests with a smile but that one Short Run hit me hard. What’s the point of technology if it cannot be used? It’s time @BCCI introduces new rules.This cannot happen every year.” Dubai: Marcus Stoinis’ all-round brilliance and Kagiso Rabada’s Super Over show helped Delhi Capitals beat Kings XI Punjab after both teams were tied on 157 in regulation time.

"Beyond boundaries, De Villiers plays for Paritosh"," The name is Pant, not Rishabh Pant, but Paritosh Pant. And while he is no cricketer, he is not far away from the game either. Not when he has AB de Villiers dedicating his Twitter and Instagram handles to his name.
So who’s Paritosh Pant? He’s a 29-year-old man who owns a barbecue café in Navi Mumbai that goes by the name of “Too Much Drama” and runs a project — Feeding From Far — through which he has helped feed and distribute ration kits to the poorest and unemployed during the pandemic-induced lockdown.
Before the start of this IPL, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) had announced they would honour the efforts and sacrifices of the Covid-19 warriors with ‘My Covid Heroes’ inscribed on the back of their jerseys while training as wells as during matches.
As part of the RCB-supported campaign by Royal Challenge Sports Drink, De Villiers spoke with Covid-19 warrior Paritosh. And that is how the South African great decided to honour Paritosh and his work.
For Paritosh, the interaction he has had with De Villiers, one of the best batsmen in modern-day cricket, will motivate him to work harder for those hit by the pandemic.
“I spoke to AB earlier this month via video call. To be honest, it was a straightforward conversation, but he was trying to understand everything that we did and heard things in detail,” Paritosh told The Telegraph from Mumbai on Monday.
“He asked me about the challenges I faced and how I reacted to them, and if I had any message to convey. I told him everything that me and the other volunteers did through our project, which is an emergency Covid relief activity in Govandi — a densely populated slum area.
“On hearing everything, he acknowledged that our work has truly been ‘inspiring’ and ‘amazing’. So it does feel nice when someone of AB’s status praises you for your work.” Elaborating on their relief activity, Paritosh added: “The life expectancy in that ward (at Govandi) is just 37-38, so one can only imagine the plight of people there.
“Fortunately, we have been able to raise around Rs 2 crore for this project, out of which, Rs 77,86,040 were crowd-funded. Besides, celebrities such as (singer and composer) Vishal Dadlani, (stand-up comedian) Abish Mathew and (writer, comedian and entrepreneur) Tanmay Bhat have supported us in our project.”
Not just De Villiers, his teammate and captain at RCB, Virat Kohli, has also dedicated his Twitter handle to a Covid-19 warrior. Kohli’s Twitter handle sports Simranjeet Singh’s name.
“In the past few months, whenever I heard the stories of the Covid heroes, it literally gave me goosebumps. These real challengers have made the country proud and inspired all of us to be more persistent and dedicated to our efforts to build a better tomorrow.
“I am truly proud to wear RCB’s ‘My Covid Heroes’ jersey as a sign of solidarity and gratitude to everyone who is right now going the extra mile to support the community at large. They have batted day and night and fought on the field, and I am honoured to call them my heroes,” Kohli had said the other day.
By the way, the cafe that Paritosh owns is run by specially-abled people and one has to place orders through sign languages.
So while De Villiers deals in boundaries and over-boundaries in the IPL, Paritosh has transcended all boundaries to serve humanity.

Owe much to Rohit Sharma: Bumrah," India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah said the freedom he enjoys playing under Rohit Sharma’s captaincy in the Mumbai Indians set-up has been a huge confidence-booster for him in his career.
Bumrah is an integral part of Mumbai Indians, which has won a record four Indian Premier League titles under Rohit’s leadership.
“He (Rohit) has always given me the freedom, he has always told me to express myself, be whatever I want, be it any situation, take ownership of my own bowling, so that gives me a lot of confidence that I’m responsible for whatever I’m doing,” Bumrah said.
“In doing so, a captain gives a bowler so much of confidence. He trusts you so much and he trusts the decisions that you will take and that’s a very positive sign.”
Not just Bumrah, Rohit’s captaincy has also come in for praise from fellow teammates and the Mumbai Indians’ coaching staff.

While head coach Mahela Jayawardene termed Rohit a “very instinctive leader”, former India speedster Zaheer Khan, who is part of the team’s support staff, described the right-handed batsman as “a thinking cricketer”.
“You have this very relaxed, cool looking guy. His mannerism when he bats, he’s got that elegance, which you can call lazy elegance. But he is very intense and hard-core when it comes to thinking about the game,” Zaheer said.",sports
Hamstrung Royals bank on Steve Smith to tame Chennai Super Kings," Rajasthan Royals will be severely paralysed when they take the field on Tuesday against Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings.
Missing from the Royals’ line-up will be big impact players Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler. Matters could have been even worse for them as there was a question mark on captain Steve Smith’s availability as well. But as of Monday, the Royals it seems will at least have the luxury of having the services of their captain, a champion batsman.
Smith has recovered from a concussion suffered during the England-Australia series and hopes to be back in action on Tuesday.
Royals’ coach Andrew McDonald was understandably elated with Smith’s availability. “Fantastic news that Steve is available. It’s fantastic especially on the back of some setbacks back in the UK. It’s obviously great to have your skipper available for the first game as I’ve said before we are in really good hands.”     
But there’s no such good news regarding Stokes. The English all-rounder is set to miss at least the first half of IPL 2020 as he has to be

Stokes’ compatriot Buttler will be missing the first game as he arrived in the UAE separately with his family and needs to undergo a 36-hour quarantine period in Dubai.
The Super Kings had appeared somewhat similarly depleted ahead of their first game against the Mumbai Indians, but a resounding victory in that match has put a blanket on all such worries.
Despite missing Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh and Dwayne Bravo, Dhoni led his team to a five-wicket win over the defending champions.
For the Royals, Jofra Archer’s presence will be important along with seasoned T20 stars like South African batsman David Miller, Australian pacer Andrew Tye and England all-rounder Tom Curran.
But it is their pool of Indian players who need to inspire confidence. The likes of Sanju Samson, Robin Uthappa, Jaydev Unadkat and Varun Aaron have not really set off fireworks in the IPL sky and the onus will be on them to make an impact.",sports
US Open: Bryson DeChambeau bags 1st Major," Bryson DeChambeau bashed his way to a six-shot US Open victory on Sunday, silencing any lingering questions as to whether his brawny game could translate to the major stage.
World No. 9 DeChambeau, who began the day two shots back of US Open debutant Matthew Wolff, clinched his first Major with a mix of jaw-dropping drives and clutch putts, shooting a virtually flawless three-under-par 67 to reach six under for the tournament.
Wolff (75) was one shot back of DeChambeau at the turn but fell apart over a back nine that included two bogeys and a double-bogey.
Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen (73) birdied the last to finish alone in third place, a distant eight shots back of DeChambeau and one shot clear of Harris English (73), who made a double-bogey at the first where he lost his tee shot.

Luka Jovic puzzle in Real Madrid draw," Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane stood by his decision to leave $71 million striker Luka Jovic on the bench as his side searched in vain for a goal in their 0-0 draw away to Real Sociedad in their first game of the La Liga season.
The Spanish champions rarely got going in attack as Karim Benzema struggled to combine with teenage wingers Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, but the coach turned to debutants Marvin and Sergio Arribas from the bench rather than the Serbia striker.
“It was difficult because we could have brought on another striker but that would have changed our shape and I didn’t want to do that, I wanted to improve our wing play by bringing on wide players and that’s what we did,” Zidane said.
Zidane was asked if he had any particular problem with Jovic, who scored 27 goals in the 2018/19 season for Eintracht Frankfurt but only started four times in the league for Real in the last campaign.
“No, we have many players in our squad and I have to pick them and I decided to do what I did,” he said.
“I don’t have anything against any player, it was all about our formation and I didn’t want to change it and Karim was playing well.”
Despite a subdued start to his side’s title defence, Zidane said he was mostly pleased with their performance even though he stressed their need to be more creative in attack and more clinical.
“We lacked a goal threat and a bit of clarity in attack, particularly in the second half, but we played well in the first 40 minutes and overall we should be happy with what we did,” he added.
“We didn’t allow them many chances and we were good in defence but we have to start working now, we know we need to improve in front of goal.
“We always like to go out to win the game so today (Sunday) we feel as though we have lost two points.”                 ",sports

Reports in Italy say Juventus are in talks with Atletico to re-sign Spain striker Alvaro Morata. Suarez had been heavily linked with Juventus but coach Andrea Pirlo said it was unlikely he would come to Italy because of the difficulty in obtaining an EU passport.

Dele Alli headache for Mourinho," Of the Tottenham Hotspur players impacted by the loan signing of Gareth Bale from Real Madrid, Dele Alli appears the most vulnerable but manager Jose Mourinho has said he will not be sacrificed in the transfer window.
“I want a balanced squad, that’s what I want. He doesn’t need to be sacrificed, but the squad is a puzzle,” Mourinho said when asked about Alli’s future on Sunday. Bale will not be ready to resume his Tottenham career until October as he regains fitness, but when he does it is likely to be in an attacking trio with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.
Alli burst into the spotlight at Tottenham in 2015-16 when he was named PFA Young Player of the Year and made his England debut.

Chahal turns it in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s favour," Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) had a lot to smile about on Monday.
Led by their trump card Yuzvendra Chahal (3/18), Virat Kohli and his men turned things around wonderfully to begin their IPL XIII campaign with a 10-run win, as Sunrisers Hyderabad lost eight wickets for just 32, at the Dubai International Stadium.
With Jonny Bairstow (61) well in control and dominating the bowling, Sunrisers were cruising at 121/2 in the 16th over in pursuit of a 164-run target. It was then that Kohli handed over the ball to Chahal, who struck twice in his final over to destabilise Sunrisers. He got Bairstow first, and then followed it up with the scalp of Vijay Shankar, off back-to-back deliveries.
That triggered the Sunrisers’ collapse as after Chahal’s game-changing over, young quick Navdeep Saini (2/25) accounted for Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Rashid Khan in a space of three balls in the 18th over. The rest was formality.
Sunrisers captain David Warner looked good at the start, but an unfortunate run out led to his dismissal. No wonder the pillars of RCB — Kohli and AB de Villiers — were pleased and relieved with their team getting off to a winning start. “Big change for me... For a change, we are on the right side of a close game. We had worked very hard for it,” De Villiers said after the match.
“It’s amazing, to be honest. Last time we were on the other side of the result, losing six (in a row). So nice to be one up.
“We kept our composure and Yuzi (Chahal) came in and completely changed the game for us. Not many spinners got much out of the pitch, but he showed that you can turn it if you have it in your wrists,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.
De Villiers (51) provided RCB with the push at the death that helped them to post a challenging 163/5 after Sunrisers won the toss and opted to bowl. Kohli contributed 14 off 13 balls.
But the man who impressed the most during RCB’s innings was young Devdutt Padikkal (56), scoring a half-century on his IPL debut.  It was a bad day for Sunrisers overall as all-rounder Mitchell Marsh twisted his ankle on the follow through during the fifth over of the RCB innings before hobbling out of the ground.
Marsh, who bowled only four balls, was sent out to bat out of desperation towards the end of the Sunrisers’ innings, but he looked to be writhing in pain.
“It doesn’t look great for Mitch. Hopefully, it isn’t too bad,” Warner said.",sports
Ravichandran Ashwin upbeat on recovery," Ravichandran Ashwin is hopeful of recovering from his shoulder injury soon as his pain has subsided considerably and the scan reports have been “encouraging”.
The senior India off-spinner suffered a nasty fall during Delhi Capitals’ IPL opener against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday.
The Capitals’ next game is against Chennai Super Kings on September 25.
Ashwin dismissed two KXIP batsmen in a space of six deliveries and then suffered a jerk on his left shoulder trying to dive and stop a run off his own bowling.
“I was in pain as I left the field last night, but the pain has settled down and the scan reports are pretty encouraging too. Thanks for all your love and support,” Ashwin tweeted on Monday.
Skipper Shreyas Iyer was also hopeful that his senior bowler would be fit in a few days. “Ashwin said he’ll be ready for the next game. But at the end of the day it’s the physio’s decision,” Iyer said.
Brought in during the final Powerplay over, Ashwin first got rid of Karun Nair and then bowled Nicholas Pooran through the gate but a needless dive to stop a single off the last delivery saw him land awkwardly on his left arm .
Writhing in pain, Ashwin’s jersey became a temporary sling as he left the field along with Capitals’ physio Patrick Farhart.",sports
Rashid designs web to snare hit-men," As a bowler, there was already a lot to worry about while playing against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) with Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers padded up to punish anything ordinary. The job for bowlers has become even tougher this time with Aaron Finch joining the deadly duo.
On Monday, Sunrisers Hyderabad’s Rashid Khan will be up against the RCB trio. The leg-spinner, considered the best currently in limited-overs format, is busy doing his homework and knows that Australia white-ball captain Finch is a better player of spin nowadays.
“Yeah, I studied Finch’s strong and weak areas and am working accordingly. No doubt, he is a very hard hitter of the ball and he has improved a lot in the last one-and-a-half years. Especially against spinners, he has been doing really well,” Rashid said when The Telegraph asked about what would be his approach against Finch, during an online interaction on Sunday.
“Still, it’s about how you bowl according to the conditions and if you can bowl those deliveries that matter on these tracks. That’s why I focus on my strong points instead of thinking about who is batting against me. Because if I think so, I may lose my line and length and not do as well as I can,” Rashid, who turned 22 on Sunday, said.
Both Rashid and Finch have had some invaluable game time coming into the IPL. While Rashid played in the Caribbean Premier League, Finch led Australia in the limited-overs series in England.
As for bowling to RCB skipper Kohli, Rashid seems ready for the challenge and quite upbeat too. More so as Kohli last played competitive cricket back in early March.
“Well, the IPL is a different league. There is pressure as you come up against big names like Virat. I’ll try and see if I can bowl to him like how I did in the past — in the World Cup and past IPL matches... Just need to have those things in mind and try to bowl my best ball against him. There shouldn’t be any excuses if I bowl a bad ball and let him smash it. I just look to keep it simple and enjoy my game.
“Yes, Virat is a world-class player across all formats. But I love it when someone like him is batting against me. It’s always the best competition that you can get as a bowler.
“Rather than feeling the pressure, I will try my best to enjoy and bowl the best delivery to him. Also, he’ll be back after a long break, so let’s see how his reaction will be,” Rashid, a pivotal part of the Sunrisers team,  explained. ",sports
Test for Kohli to get Royal Challengers Bangalore going," Virat Kohli, having said that he has never felt as good — “calm” in his words — before an IPL season as this time, will hope his mood doesn’t change after the Royal Challengers Bangalore’s opening game of the tournament against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday.
Kohli’s counterpart, David Warner, has promised that they will give their “best” and is confident that Sunrisers have a pretty “balanced” squad this time.
The pressure will be more on Kohli as he leads a team which is infamous as the perennial under-achievers.
Both teams possess dangerous batsmen who can single-handedly take the game away from the opposition.
Kohli has always led from the front but he knows his search for a maiden title will remain incomplete if the team doesn’t perform in all departments. The addition of Australian limited overs captain Aaron Finch to the squad gives the star-studded batting line-up more firepower. Expectations are also high from highly rated young opener Devdutt Padikal.

On the other hand, Warner, whose exploits in the IPL include winning the Orange Cap thrice and leading his side to a maiden title triumph in 2016, will once again pair up with the dangerous Jonny Bairstow. The formidable opening duo, who shattered multiple records, including the highest opening partnership in IPL history against RCB last season, will hope to emulate the previous edition’s exploits.
Sunrisers also have the batting prowess of Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Mitchell Marsh and Fabian Allen.  
Following a nightmarish 2019 season when they finished last, RCB seem to have much better balance but there ability to hit late in the innings is yet to be tested.
Sunrisers’ blind spot also lies in the lack of depth in their batting order. The franchise has invested in youngsters like Virat Singh, Abhishek Sharma, Priyam Garg and Abdul Samad. 
“We will try our best for that and if it doesn’t happen, will re-work our strategies and hope to go the distance in the IPL,” Warner said during a virtual media interaction. “Every team has a perfect mix of world-class overseas players and quality Indian players. Ours is a pretty good balanced side in all departments.
“The boys have to just go out there and have fun, not take it too seriously.
“Like if you get angry you will tend to repeat the mistakes.”
About the team’s youngsters, Warner said: “Yes, it is good to have a lot of youngsters in the middle-order. They bring a lot of enthusiasm and show the right kind of attitude, too. I have been hearing some very good reports about it on social media and hope they translate their talent into performances.”
A team that is known for its depth and variation in bowling, Sunrisers’ core unit remains unchanged.
Bhuvneshwar Kumar will spearhead the pace department with Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul and Basil Thampi playing secondary roles.
Armed with the presence of the top T20 bowler Afghanistan leggie Rashid Khan and No.1 all-rounder in the format Mohammed Nabi, who was in a terrific form in the recently-concluded CPL, Sunrisers have one of the best spin bowling attacks.
RCB also boast of a potent spin unit, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will again be the key as he has been over the past seasons with Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Adam Zampa and Moeen Ali lending more options. ",sports
Pat Cummins shares wisdom," Being among the top-class bowlers at present in international cricket, Pat Cummins indeed brings the fear factor for the opponents of Kolkata Knight Riders in this IPL.
However, the Australia speedster, ranked No. 1 in Test cricket, knows well enough that he also has a big role ahead guiding KKR’s young pacers, especially the likes of Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi, both of whom have little or no experience in the IPL due to injuries.
Everything that these young quicks do at this stage sets up their foundation block for a long and healthy career, Cummins advised.
“It is really an easy thing to say and think of, but an 18-year-old missing games is actually something very hard to live with. You just need to have the trust that you might miss a season or two at the start of your career, but you might end up playing till the age of 36 or 37, as opposed to 31 or 32,” Cummins, serving room quarantine at present, said in an interview to kkr.in.
“Everything that you do during this time sets up the foundation block for a long and healthy career. Even when I was not playing, I used to hang out with my teammates.
“Ninety per cent of the time I love cricket because I can hang out with my mates.” 
Powerplay overs could be Cummins’ ideal time to bowl, considering the amount of swing he can obtain. But the strike bowler is ready to bowl at any time of the game, also citing why he’s fond of the game’s shortest format.
“The thing I love about T20 cricket is it’s ultra-attacking, or at the death, it’s ultra-defensive. There is no middle ground. So in T20 cricket, if you are an all-out bowler, you get to bowl at any time of the match. That’s why I love the format,” he said.
Talking about his admiration for KKR head coach Brendon McCullum, Cummins said: “The first thing that I am really excited about is that I don’t have to bowl to him anymore... He was one of the best and most feared hitters I have come up against in my career.
“It can be the first ball of the match and he might be hitting over your head for a six. So I am happy that he is in my team as a coach and that I don’t have to bowl to him. ”",sports
Ashwin sustains shoulder injury," Senior India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin experienced dream and nightmare in a space of six deliveries as he scalped two batsmen and then suffered a suspected shoulder dislocation during Delhi Capitals’ IPL XIII opening game versus Kings XI Punjab at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.
Brought in during the final Powerplay over, Ashwin first got Karun Nair and then bowled Nicholas Pooran through the gates, but a needless dive to stop a single off the last delivery of that over saw him land awkwardly on his left arm with the shoulder taking a jerk.
Writhing in pain, Ashwin’s jersey became a temporary sling as he left the field along with Capitals’ head physio Patrick Farhart.
A shoulder dislocation could rule Ashwin out of the tournament, which would then be a massive jolt for the Delhi Capitals.
Ashwin’s figures were 2/2 off the only over he could bowl. Not just by the figures, but the intelligence with which he was bowling could well have made life even tougher for the Kings XI batsmen. The Kings XI were wobbling at 35/3 after six overs when Ashwin was on his way out of the field.

Ashwin looked to be bowling with intent and purpose. But his needless act only allowed Kings XI to regroup, before Mayank Agarwal unleashed those terrific shots that took the game to a Super Over.  ",sports
Kings XI Punjab falter at last hurdle against Delhi Capitals," In T20s, it’s never over till it’s over. And on Sunday, it was only over after the Super Over.
Mayank Agarwal did all the hard work and also enjoyed a slice of luck to play a splendid knock that had almost taken Kings XI Punjab home. But with one run required from last three balls, he faltered and was dismissed off the penultimate ball and eventually the match went into a Super Over. 
Delhi Capitals then prevailed in the Super Over to begin their IPL XIII campaign with a thrilling victory at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.
Innings-wise, Mayank overshadowed Marcus Stoinis whose tremendous batting at the death lifted Delhi Capitals to 157/8, something that looked most unlikely. But it was Stoinis who had the last laugh.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM When all that Mayank needed to do off the final three balls was just take a single, he hit a full toss straight to the lone fielder at sweeper cover. And off the last ball of the match, Chris Jordan played another full toss straight to Kagiso Rabada, who reacted sharply at square leg. Stoinis thus did his job with the ball too and both teams then went into the Super Over with identical scores.
In the Super Over, Rabada, off whose bowling Mayank was let off by Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer in the penultimate over of the game, kept his line and length right to get rid of Kings XI captain KL Rahul and Nicholas Pooran, who suffered the ignominy of bagging a pair of sorts and getting bowled twice in a T20 match.
Delhi Capitals needed just three to win and they reached home with four balls to spare. Also surprising was why the Kings XI didn’t send in Mayank to bat in the Super Over, unless of course he was suffering from cramps or had fitness issues. The game could have been a lot more easier for Delhi Capitals, though, had Ravichandran Ashwin not put in an unnecessary dive that hurt his left shoulder. Ashwin had bowled very intelligently in his first over, striking twice as he removed Karun Nair and Pooran, conceding only two runs.
Captain Iyer, however, is hopeful of Ashwin’s availability from the next match itself although he agreed that the final decision on the matter would be taken by the physio. 
Earlier, Stoinis stole the thunder from Mohammed Shami with a belligerent 21-ball-53 that gave Delhi Capitals a good amount of momentum. Delhi Capitals scored 57 runs in the last 18 balls with Stoinis producing a whirlwind knock that had seven fours and three sixes.Jordan, conceding 30 runs off the last over, thus bowled the most expensive 20th over in IPL, a record he shares with Ashok Dinda.",sports
Gareth Bale praises Jose Mourinho," Tottenham Hotspur forward Gareth Bale is relishing the opportunity to work with manager Jose Mourinho who had unsuccessfully tried to sign the Welshman in the past. Bale completed a loan move from Spanish champions Real Madrid back to his former club Spurs on Saturday, ending a seven-year stay at the Bernabeu.
Mourinho said he tried to sign Bale when he was in charge of Real from 2010 to 2013. The Wales international was also regularly linked with a move to Manchester United when the Portuguese was in charge at Old Trafford.
“He’s spoken to me about a few positions that he would like me to play and obviously I’m happy with that,” Bale, 31, said. “He was a big reason for me coming back here, he’s a household name and a winner. He’s the perfect fit for Tottenham.”

Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu wants peace," FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said he does not wish to have any more disputes with captain Lionel Messi after the Argentinian reluctantly opted to stay at the club this month after failing to force through a move.
“I won’t get into any conflict with him. He’s our captain and the leader of our team,” Bartomeu told Catalan television network TV3 before the team’s 1-0 friendly win over Elche on Saturday. The club’s all-time leading scorer set up Barcelona’s only goal when he made a long pass to meet the run of Jordi Alba, who squared the ball for Antoine Griezmann to score in the third minute.
“I couldn’t let him leave the club, he is the best player of all time and the team needs him. Having Messi is a guarantee of success.”
Messi had complained earlier this month that Bartomeu had not fulfilled a promise to allow him to break his contract unilaterally and leave the club without a transfer fee, also lashing out at the president’s leadership.
But Bartomeu chose not to fire back against Barca’s all-time top scorer, instead praising Messi for turning a page and performing well in the team’s pre-season matches, including scoring twice in a 3-1 win over Girona last week.

“We have seen him do his talking on the pitch and we have moved on from the saga,” Bartomeu added. “We should congratulate ourselves for getting Messi to stay with us...”
Bartomeu said he has no intention of resigning after more than 20,000 club members signed a petition for his and the board to face a censure vote. “No one is thinking about stepping down,” he said.
On Thursday the group of club members wanting a change in the leadership handed in 20,687 signatures calling for a referendum over whether the board should be removed. That surpassed the 16,520 signatures needed to force the vote.                         ",sports
"Nadal out of Italian Open, eyes on French Open"," Rafa Nadal refused to make excuses for his shock defeat by Diego Schwartzman in the quarter finals of the Italian Open, insisting that his focus is now on fine-tuning his game ahead of the French Open which begins on September 27.
The nine-time Rome champion looked well off the pace in his 6-2, 7-5 loss to the 15th-ranked Argentinel.
 “We can find excuses, but I didn’t play well enough. Then we have to think internally, ‘Why? How I can fix it?’” the 34-year-old Spaniard told reporters. “Now is not the moment to find excuses. It’s just to accept that I didn’t play well enough.”
 Nadal, who skipped the US Open owing to Covid-19 concerns, said he would regroup before heading to Paris, where he will bid for a record-extending 13th title.
 “It’s a completely special and unpredictable year. I probably will go back home and then let’s see what’s going on,” the 19-time Grand Slam champion said.
 “I did my job here. I did a couple things well and other things bad. I’m going to keep working and keep practising with the right attitude and try to give myself a chance to be ready.”                                        ",sports

Sadio Mane’s brace as Liverpool overcome Chelsea," Two goals from Sadio Mane just after half-time eased champions Liverpool to a 2-0 win over 10-man Chelsea in the Premier League season’s first heavyweight clash at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
A dull game never threatened to live up to the eight-goal thriller when the sides met in July, and it proved all-too-easy for Liverpool to lay down an early marker although Chelsea were architects of their own downfall.
Chelsea managed only one goal attempt in the first half but were solid enough until Danish defender Andreas Christensen was sent off shortly before the interval for hauling down Mane. Mane headed Liverpool in front five minutes after the interval and four minutes later took advantage of a dreadful error by Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga as the hosts crumbled.
Liverpool gave new midfield signing Thiago Alcantara a debut off the bench but the Spaniard’s first impact was to offer Chelsea a lifeline by fouling Timo Werner to concede a penalty with a little under 20 minutes remaining. Chelsea, however, missed the opportunity.

Danny Ings finished well from a tight angle in the 32nd minute to put Southampton ahead.
Son, with Spurs’ first shot at goal, latched onto a fine first-time pass from Kane before equalising in first-half stoppage time. That same combination unlocked the hosts two minutes after the break, with Son taking advantage of a high Saints defensive line before racing clear to score.

IPL: ‘Old’ warriors fetch Super Kings victory," Age is just a number even for cricket’s youngest format.
That was proved again during the opening game of IPL 2020 between the Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians, in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Thirtyfour-year-old Ambati Rayudu (71) and Faf du Plessis (58 not out), aged 36, came up with performances that helped the Super Kings fly off to a winning start, thrashing the defending champions by five wickets at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium.
Together, Du Plessis and Rayudu stitched a vital 115-run partnership for the third wicket after the Super Kings were reeling at 6/2 in the second over of their reply, in response to Mumbai Indians’ 162/9.
All-rounder Sam Curran played a superb cameo (18 off 6 balls) as the Super Kings reached home with four balls to spare. “You need to send players like Sam up the order so that they can express themselves and intimidate opposition bowlers at the same time,” winning captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said at the post-match presentation. Dhoni was the other unbeaten batsman, though he faced just two balls. He was given out off the first ball he faced, off Jasprit Bumrah, in the penultimate over of the match. But DRS ruled in his favour.
This was also the Super Kings’ first victory over Mumbai Indians after five matches.
Earlier, Dhoni’s astute captaincy was backed up by some brilliant bowling at the back end as the Super Kings restricted Mumbai Indians even after the latter got off to a flying start.
Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (1/21 in four overs) and Curran (1/28 in four overs) made a fantastic first impression, while Lungi Ngidi (3/38 in four overs) and Deepak Chahar (2/32 in four overs) came back brilliantly in the death overs.
“None of our batsmen carried on for us, like Du Plessis and Rayudu did for CSK. It’s something we need to learn,” Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma said.",sports
Quarantine was tough for MS Dhoni," The quarantine period after arriving in Dubai was the toughest phase for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who made a comeback of sorts to cricket in the IPL opener against Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
The Chennai Super Kings squad had to quarantine themselves for almost 14 days after 13 members of their contingent, including two players, tested positive after landing.
“I think first of all, we need to applaud the contribution from each and every member of the squad. It’s the new set of rules…  it’s a very difficult one.
“What makes it more difficult is you spend five months with your family, wife, children, parents and all of a sudden you’re sitting in your room. I felt each and every individual, they used that time well and nobody was really disappointed or frustrated,” Dhoni said after winning the toss.
“After that, whatever time we got with the practice facilities, which were very good, and we made the most of it.”

Dhoni was absolutely relaxed in his first match since announcing international retirement. Reminded about the social distancing norms, he quipped that he had checked with the match referee whether first slip was allowed. “So that’s why I asked the match referee if you can keep first slip, whether it comes under the rules and regulations of social distancing,” he said.
Dhoni, who last played for India during the semi-final loss to New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup, said he worked on his fitness during the pandemic-induced lockdown in India. His bulging biceps were there for everyone to see.
“Had the liberty during lockdown to spend time on yourself to keep fit. Have to applaud every member of the squad for utilising the time well,” he said.",sports
Punter bets on Rishabh Pant impact," Rishabh Pant has been under a lot of scrutiny because of his inconsistent performance but Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting feels there is no extra pressure on the wicketkeeper-batsman. The former Australian captain expects Pant to make a “big impact” on this year’s IPL.
Delhi Capitals open versus Kings XI Punjab on Sunday.
Pant was the leading run-scorer for the Capitals in 2018, with 684 runs at a strike rate of 173.60, while last year, his tally of 488 runs was second only to Shikhar Dhawan’s 521 for the franchise.
“Every season, every game, any of these guys play (it) is always an important game for them — probably more so for the Indian players than the overseas guys,” Ponting said during a virtual media conference. “But as a coaching group at Delhi Capitals, we don’t put any added pressure on any of the guys. As a coaching group, what we are trying to do is take as much pressure off the players as we can.
“Just watching Rishabh train — certainly the last week — I think he has really turned a corner, and I am expecting him to once again have a really big impact on the tournament. We know he is a match-winner and if he can win the same amount of games that he won for us last year, I think that should hold us in good stead.”

Wiser from last year’s experience, Ponting is looking forward to the challenge.

In Morgan 2.0 Kolkata Knight Riders trust," Brendon McCullum and Eoin Morgan were teammates at Kolkata Knight Riders back in the 2012 edition of the IPL. Cut to present, McCullum has retired from international cricket as one of the greats from New Zealand, while Morgan has raised his stocks having led England to their first ODI World Cup triumph last year.
The Knight Riders have brought the two together again — McCullum as the head coach and Morgan as a key member of the playing group. 
In McCullum’s eyes, the England white-ball captain has been the “best middle-order batsman” in the last few years.
“If we look at the first part of Eoin’s career, which was his apprenticeship, he was good at times at the international stage. But what we have seen over the last four or five years is a player who has taken his belief in his game and has led England and completely changed how the whole country play its cricket. He got ultimate success in the form of the World Cup triumph.
“Now when you see him bat, he is completely free, content with his game, understands his game and can play it how he wants to. Now that he’s free, he’s an incredibly dangerous player and probably the best middle-order batsman in the shorter version over the last two years,” McCullum said from Abu Dhabi in response to a question from The Telegraph on Morgan’s growth as both player and captain.

“We are very lucky to have him. His relationship with (captain) Dinesh Karthik throughout the campaign will give us a good opportunity to make an impact in the league.” Promising youngster Shubman Gill could be one of Knight Riders’ top-order batters as McCullum backs him to deal with “tricky wickets early on against fast bowling”.
“Shubman is suited at the top of the order and he is a quality player. Especially if the wickets are going to be tricky early on against fast bowling, you would want your players with the best technique, batsmanship and craft, and he is one of those guys. I see him batting for us at the top of the order throughout our campaign,” the head coach said.
“From a leadership point of view, I’m very impressed with how Shubman carries himself and the way he plays the game. I feel he has got a bit of presence about him even at a very young age.
“What I want to see the most out of him is to grow in his own time and space along with taking those around him,  those who are reasonably inexperienced and helping them grow at the same rate that he is growing in his own career,” McCullum added.",sports
Leeds United record first win in EPL," Newly-promoted Leeds United continued their barnstorming return to the Premier League as they claimed their first points with a thrilling 4-3 win over Fulham at Elland Road on Saturday.
After being on the wrong end of a 4-3 scoreline at champions Liverpool on the opening day, Leeds, back in the top flight after a 16-year absence, produced more vibrant attacking football along with defensive jitters.
Two goals from Helda Costa and one apiece for Mateusz Klich and Patrick Bamford should have made for a more comfortable afternoon for Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.
But Aleksandar Mitrovic’s brace kept Fulham, promoted along with Leeds last season, in the hunt in an absorbing clash played out at a punishing tempo throughout.
For Leeds, the relief was palpable as the final whistle heralded their first top-flight win since April 2004.
“It was a little too close in the end,” Bamford, who also scored at Liverpool, said. While defensive coaches may pick holes in the Leeds approach, there will be few complaints among the Yorkshire club’s fans, or neutrals, if they keep serving up this kind of entertainment.
They needed only five minutes to go ahead as Costa, unmarked at the back post, took a touch and smashed home.",sports
Shambolic Manchester United begin with defeat," Crystal Palace condemned Manchester United to a miserable start to their Premier League campaign as Andros Townsend and a Wilfried Zaha double led the visitors to successive wins at the start of a season for the first time in their history.
After Townsend squeezed a seventh-minute shot into the far corner from Jeffrey Schlupp’s cross, the hosts struggled badly but the game slipped away from them thanks to Zaha’s controversial 74th-minute penalty.
Referee Martin Atkinson used the VAR TV monitor to decide Victor Lindelof had handled inside his own box. But, after David De Gea thought he had saved Jordan Ayew’s spot-kick, Atkinson ordered a retake because the Spain international had moved off his line. Zaha took responsibility for the second attempt and made no mistake.
On his debut, Donny van de Beek pulled one back 10 minutes from time but Zaha struck again against his former club to secure a deserved victory for Palace.
It was their biggest ever win at Old Trafford, the first time they have beaten United away from home in successive seasons. Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez scored his first Premier League goal and Dominic Calvert-Lewin bagged a hat-trick as Everton thrashed 10-man West Bromwich Albion 5-2 at Goodison Park on Saturday.
West Brom opened the scoring through Grady Diangana, but when Calvert-Lewin equalised following an intervention from the VAR, Everton took control.
They scored five goals in 35 minutes as West Brom capitulated following a needless red card for Kieran Gibbs.
Rodriguez whipped Everton in front from the edge of the box, and Michael Keane and Calvert-Lewin ensured it was two wins from two in the Premier League so far this season.",sports
Bayern Munich make a rousing start," The new Bundesliga began in an empty stadium with eight-time defending champions Bayern Munich routing visitors Schalke 8-0 for a record in the league’s opening match. And it should have been more.
Germany winger Leroy Sané starred on Friday and scored on his Bayern debut and Jamal Musiala became Bayern’s youngest ever goal-scorer at 17 years, 205 days, but otherwise it was business as usual as they totally dominated and the visitors tried limiting the damage.
Schalke’s winless run stretched to 17 games, while Bayern extended their winning run to 22.
Serge Gnabry scored a hat trick and Sané set up two of the goals. It was 3-0 by half-time and Bayern missed a host of chances. “Everyone was so hungry. We were all looking forward to the new start and we just wanted to attack,” said Sané, a former Schalke player who joined Bayern from Manchester City in the off-season.
“It was superb from us. Before the game we wanted this to be a game that would define where we are at this stage and my players did it very well,” Bayern coach Hansi Flick said.

The indispensable premier league," No lung-bursting sea of blue and gold at the Wankhede, no electrifying chorus of Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo at the Eden Gardens, no whistle podu army in sync with the yellow band at Chepauk. No fans, no atmosphere, no cricket in India. Covid-19 has cancelled them all. And yet, the IPL is back, having shifted its paraphernalia to the Middle East. In a year that has seen the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, along with a chunk of international cricket, moved to 2021 or postponed indefinitely, the IPL could only be delayed, not denied.

FANTASY CRICKET
“It’s really unusual to come to Bombay, hit a four, and see nobody clapping for you,” mused Rahul Dravid, after representing Royal Challengers Bangalore at the home of Mumbai Indians in the debut instalment of the IPL, all the way back in 2008. I was 10 at the time, barely able to believe that my fantasy teams from the world of book cricket were now playing for real. Ricky Ponting and Sourav Ganguly in the same camp, Western Australia’s Adam Gilchrist captaining a franchise from Hyderabad, Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya opening the batting together, a teenage spinner in Ravindra Jadeja being mentored by Shane Warne at Rajasthan — the IPL took some getting used to. And get used to it I did, along with the rest of the cricketing world.
International series were scheduled to avoid clashing with the IPL, international cricketers were lured in for previously unimaginable contracts, international eyes were glued to a paradigm shift in cricket. No matter their quality or track-record, no player worth his fame could sidestep the burgeoning phenomenon of the IPL.
Once upon a time, playing on the racing tracks of Perth or navigating a summer of English swing was supposed to culminate one’s cricketing education. Now, no cricketing journey could be complete without sporting a glitzy kit, winning a last-ball thriller and grooving to a Bollywood song for the cameras in the carnivalesque realm of the IPL.
MORE THAN CRICKETAINMENT

Yes, the IPL disrupted cricket, sending its measured, protracted pace for a toss. But it also took the sport beyond its zealous cognoscenti by converting the gentleman’s game into everybody’s game.
Should you want to witness Shah Rukh Khan cartwheeling on grass, watch the IPL. Should you want to observe Preity Zinta travel through her entire emotional spectrum inside one over, watch the IPL. Should you want to follow the minutiae of Nita Ambani’s prayer routine, watch the IPL. And, of course, should you want to see the best cricketers slog it out for three exhilarating hours every evening, watch the IPL, too.
So what if the IPL has no place for classical talents like Cheteshwar Pujara? It has a place for a 41-year-old leg-spin debutant in Pravin Tambe. So what if a Paul Valthaty, having produced an unforgettable knock in 2011, is thrown back to cricketing oblivion, gobbled up by the ruthless system that had discovered him in the first place? So what if some sanctimonious Indians cannot accept scantily-clad women gyrating on the field? As long as many more are eager to embrace this novelty.... So what if Lalit Modi, the man who had engineered the whole show, becomes its most notorious outcast, going from pioneer to pariah?
The IPL is not for contempt, critiques, or complacency. It is not merely a hybrid of cricket and entertainment. It is a bubble of its own (now bio-secure but never power-secure) where picture-book cover-drives, toe-crushing yorkers, celebrity stunts, sideline titillations, and cascading reputations do not discriminate against each other, for they are all part of the same product — one that never ceases to amaze. AN INDUSTRY OF EMOTIONS
It is this instinct to amaze that has brought the IPL, against the odds, back to our screens in 2020. An instinct that involves marooning hundreds of athletes, support staff, and media personnel a couple of thousand miles away from Indian shores to produce 50 days of non-stop action, only to pack up and do it all over again next spring.
It does not matter if there is the occasional glitch, if a few bilateral internationals have to be compromised, if egos have to be inconvenienced. The IPL must go on, not because cricket cannot go on without it, but because, having scaled the heights it has, the IPL must repeat itself for its own unquenchable sake.
The relationship between the IPL and cricket had never been forged with any deliberate intricacy — the rewards and the regrets that have transpired between this centuries-old sport and its 12-year-old enterprise have been entirely incidental, a largely beautiful, if sometimes brutal, coincidence.
The IPL was not designed to benefit cricket or to bedevil it. It was designed to be an industry of emotions, to mirror the theatre of life in all its tumultuous tensions and triumphs.
It is only fitting, therefore, that in this most bewildering of years, when so much of what we have known and loved (and occasionally loathed) has evaporated into a mist of uncertainty, the IPL remains —  intact, intriguing, indispensable. An unprecedented event for unprecedented times. With the latest edition of the IPL underway, The Telegraph sheds light on the biggest questions that will shape the course of cricket’s annual festival

ARE ROYAL CHALLENGERS MORE THAN A TWO-MAN SHOW?
Virat and ABD, ABD and Virat. It is impossible to think of RCB without the two most gifted batsmen of their generation. Unfortunately, it has also been impossible to think of the IPL’s most topsy-turvy franchise beyond these two. Out of the 23 games RCB have won in the last four seasons, only nine have produced a man of the match not named Virat Kohli or AB De Villiers. The arrival of Australian powerhouse Aaron Finch should go some way towards addressing this lop-sided dynamic, but RCB will also require established names like Moeen Ali and Parthiv Patel to emerge as match winners. As always, death bowling remains a major issue, with a lot riding on Umesh Yadav and a less-than-vintage Dale Steyn to prevent late game leakages for Kohli and Co. CAN CSK THRIVE WITHOUT SURESH RAINA?
As much as the identity of Chennai Super Kings is tied to the enigma of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the importance of Suresh Raina has been no less in making CSK the most consistent outfit in IPL history. In nine of his 12 seasons for the men in yellow, Raina has scored more than 400 runs, forming a reliable fulcrum around which the rest of the batting revolves. With CSK’s perennial number three backing out of this year’s edition (citing personal reasons), the Raina-sized hole will need to be filled by other frontline batsmen like Ambati Rayudu, Shane Watson, and Faf du Plessis. Surprise inclusions like that of Murali Vijay in the top three remain very much on the cards, as does the possibility of a promotion up the order for Thala himself, as MSD looks to quell the doubts around his batting form in the wake of his international retirement last month.

CAN SUNRISERS RESOLVE THEIR MIDDLE OVERS MUDDLE?
As the only team to have made it to the final four in each of the last four years, it is no wonder to find Sunrisers Hyderabad better organised than most other franchises. But while SRH have the mettle of David Warner and Jonny Bairstow at the top with the bat and the guile of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Rashid Khan at the end with the ball, it is the middle overs that could seal their fate this season. Manish Pandey and Wriddhiman Saha will need to come up trumps with bat in hand and Mohammad Nabi must spearhead the bowlers when Rashid is not there to take charge in the middle of an innings. Having said that, the muddle in the middle could disappear miraculously if a certain Vijay Shankar, frequently maligned since a disappointing World Cup last year, could fulfill his potential with both bat and ball.

WILL PAT CUMMINS LIVE UP TO HIS BILLING FOR KOLKATA?
The costliest buys at the IPL auction have generally struggled to make the expected impact. Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen, Yuvraj Singh, Shane Watson — the list is long and, hopefully for KKR, will not include the name of Pat Cummins at the end of this season. Having paid a whopping Rs 15.5 crore for the Australian paceman, the Knights will rely on Cummins to make early inroads into the opposition batting on a regular basis, before the likes of Lockie Ferguson, Kuldeep Yadav, and Sunil Narine can assert themselves. But, notwithstanding the huge outlay on Cummins, KKR have several other match winners, not least of whom is Andre Russell, arguably the finest all-rounder the IPL has ever seen.

WILL DELHI’S DOMESTIC CORE COME UP CLUTCH?
Delhi Capitals had an impressive outing last season, but fell short at the crucial hurdle of the playoffs. If they are to go one step further under the management of Ricky Ponting in 2020, their excellent core of domestic players will have to fire when it matters most. Apart from skipper Shreyas Iyer, DC boast seasoned Indians like Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, and Ishant Sharma. Add to that the fearless firepower of starlets Prithvi Shaw and Rishabh Pant and DC could conceivably field an all-India 11 and still remain extremely competitive. While foreign talent in the shape of Kagiso Rabada and Shimron Hetmyer will undoubtedly have pivotal contributions, the fortunes of the team from the capital will be determined by whether Iyer can get the best out of those he is most familiar with in the blue of India.

WILL RAJASTHAN BE ABLE TO OPTIMISE THEIR OVERSEAS OVERFLOW?
In an inversion of the scenario at DC, Rajasthan Royals have a plethora of overseas internationals but a dearth of India regulars in their ranks. Thus, choosing the right four in every 11 out of their expansive quota of foreign players will be their toughest challenge. Ben Stokes, Jos Butler, and Jofra Archer are expected to play more often than not, but despite their star power, RR will count on the young brigade of Indians to play their part if they are to reach a first final since winning the whole thing in the inaugural edition. One youngster desperate to impress will be 18-year-old Yashasvi Jaiswal, touted to be the next big thing in Indian cricket. ARE THERE ANY CHINKS IN THE MUMBAI ARMOUR?
On paper, defending champions Mumbai Indians seem virtually flawless. Packed with all-rounders like Kieron Pollard and the Pandya brothers, stocked with the limitless batting abilities of Chris Lynn, Quinton de Kock, and, of course, Rohit Sharma, and blessed with the versatile bowling arsenal of Jasprit Bumrah, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Trent Boult, among others, MI have what it takes to glide along comfortably, at least till the playoffs. The only chink in the Mumbai armour, therefore, could be complacency, though their dismal record in the UAE (from 2014) should guard against any overweening belief. For the fatalists, this will not be Mumbai’s year because 2020 is an even number! But for the realists, not to mention the MI fans, it is difficult to see a heavier favourite at the start of proceedings than the men in blue and gold.

CAN K.L. RAHUL PULL OFF THE MUCH-VAUNTED TRIPLE ACT?
To be wicketkeeper, opening batsman and captain is an unenviable triad of responsibilities in the explosive format of the IPL. But that is precisely what awaits K.L. Rahul at Kings XI Punjab. Never shy of stepping up to the big stage, Rahul has the full backing of coach Anil Kumble as well as the personality to relish the pressure of juggling three demanding tasks instead of buckling under the strain. With question marks surrounding the effectiveness of T20 legends Chris Gayle and Glenn Maxwell, Rahul may have to take some unpopular calls as the season transpires. While the Kings do not start as favourites in anybody’s book, it is not beyond Rahul to take his team all the way, especially if his triple act, like that of Adam Gilchrist for the Deccan Chargers in 2009, comes to the fore. The Telegraph brings to you the most important facts and figures from the incredible history of the Indian Premier League
3: The most number of hat-tricks by a player in IPL cricket, a feat that partly explains why veteran leg-spinner Amit Mishra has been one of the standout performers in this tournament. The only other player to take more than one hat-trick (with two trebles) is, somewhat surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh.

263 for 5: The all-time highest score in the IPL, notched up by a belligerent batting performance from Royal Challengers Bangalore against the now-defunct Pune Warriors India in 2013. This match also featured the IPL’s highest individual score, an unbeaten 175 by Chris Gayle.

6 for 12: The most sensational bowling figures ever registered in the IPL. What is even more sensational is that they came on debut, for last year’s boy wonder Alzarri Joseph against the Sunrisers.

6.55: With such a miserly economy rate, Afghanistan’s talisman Rashid Khan is the most reliable bowler in the IPL when it comes to putting a lid on the scoring.

170: This will only be the third IPL in history (after 2008 and 2018) without the competition’s highest wicket-taker, Lasith Malinga, in action. Behind Malinga’s impressive tally of 170 wickets on the all-time IPL list are three Indian spinners — Amit Mishra, Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla.

4: The most number of titles won by a single franchise, a record held by Rohit Sharma’s Mumbai Indians, with each of their victories coming in odd-numbered years (2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019).

5412: The most number of individual runs in IPL history, belonging to RCB’s Virat Kohli, whose best campaign included a mind-boggling 973 runs (also a record) in 2016, the year Kohli and Co. narrowly lost in the finals on home turf to Sunrisers Hyderabad.

9: The most consecutive wins any IPL team has ever managed, put together by Kolkata Knight Riders during their glorious campaign of 2014.

44: The lowest win percentage among the eight franchises currently in the IPL, held by Delhi Capitals (previously Delhi Daredevils), who are also the only team (still active) to have never reached an IPL final.

109: The number of IPL matches India’s Sundaram Ravi has officiated in as an on-field umpire, more than anyone else in history.

146: The biggest winning margin (in terms of runs) in an IPL game, achieved by Mumbai Indians against Delhi Daredevils en route to a third trophy in 2017.

186.41: The best all-time batting strike rate in the IPL (with a minimum of 100 balls faced). No surprise that the man possessing it is KKR’s Andre Russell.

IPL 2020: best of the best," IPL 2020 begins today. Before the action starts, The Telegraph picks its “Dream XI” from the players on this edition’s roster. As is the norm in IPL, we have kept only four foreign players and so have missed out on many worthy names. Rohit Sharma (MI, captain): With his ability to win matches single-handedly and unleash those big hits effortlessly, Rohit is an automatic choice as an opener. With four IPL trophies to his credit as captain, he gets to lead the “Dream” team as well.
IPL credentials: Matches 188, Runs 4898, Avg.31.60, S/r 130.82, Fours 431, Sixes 194
KL Rahul (KXIP): The most improved Indian batsman of recent times, Rahul will be the perfect second opener. With his stylish, free-flowing game, he can actually hold his own and can even turn out to be a bigger impact player than Rohit.
IPL credentials: Matches 67, Runs 1977, Avg. 42.06, S/r 138.15, Fours 176, Sixes 81 Virat Kohli (RCB): Kohli has evolved into a man for all formats, on all pitches, against all oppositions. Some question his effectiveness in the shortest format, but his IPL record tells a different story. For example, he has hit more fours than Rohit Sharma playing lesser games.
IPL credentials: Matches 177, Runs 5412, Avg. 37.84, S/r 131.61, Fours 480, Sixes 190
Shreyas Iyer (DC): Iyer possesses a compact game, has all kinds of shots in his armoury and knows how to shift gears quickly. He is a tough competitor, someone who can bail out his team in a crisis situation.
IPL credentials: Matches 62, Runs 1681, Avg. 30.56, S/r 126.96, Fours 149, Sixes 67
Jos Buttler (RR, wicketkeeper): He can take the game away from the opposition single-handedly and is especially a precious hand during tough chases. And he can also open the innings if need be. Makes the side over the still-formidable MS Dhoni. Enough said.
IPL credentials: Matches 45, Runs 1386, Avg. 35.53, S/r 150.81, Fours 140, Sixes 61 Hardik Pandya (MI): He has matured into a good medium pacer. He can take the new ball as well if required. His explosive cameos with the bat can be game-changing.
IPL credentials: Matches 68, Runs 1068, Avg. 28.86, S/r 154.78, Fours 72, Sixes 68, Wickets 42
Kieron Pollard (MI):  The Caribbean star is coming off a very successful CPL, having led the Trinbago Knight Riders to the title. He scored 207 runs at an average of 51.75 and took 8 wickets as well. One of the biggest hitters of the ball, he is also a breathtaking fielder.
IPL credentials: Matches 148, Runs 2755, Avg. 28.69, S/r 146.77, Fours 181, Sixes 176, Wickets 56
Ravindra Jadeja (CSK): A spin bowling all-rounder is just what the doctor ordered for the UAE wickets. Jadeja can provide crucial breakthroughs with his left-arm spin and check the run flow as well. He is an explosive batsman and is perhaps the best fielder in the world now.
IPL credentials: Matches 170, Runs 1927, Avg. 24.08, S/r 122.58, Fours 135, Sixes 65, Wickets 108 Sunil Narine (KKR): The off-spinner goes about his job quickly, finishing his spells even before the opposition batsmen can plan against him.
IPL credentials: Matches 110, Wickets 122, Avg. 23.31, Eco 6.67, 4-wicket hauls 6
Rashid Khan (SRH): Arguably the best leg-spinner in the limited-overs formats in the world currently, Rashid has a bagful of skills. He is a decent lower-order batsman too.
IPL credentials: Matches 46, Wickets 55, Avg. 21.69, Eco 6.55, 4-wicket hauls 0 Jasprit Bumrah (MI): The lone specialist pacer in the team, but we have got the best one. The highly-rated bowler, who’s also Virat Kohli's favourite, burst on to the scene in IPL 2013.  He bowls fast, he bowls accurate and is a master of yorkers.

Solskjaer’s support to Greenwood for England dismissal," Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood’s first England call-up ended with him being disciplined for breaking Covid-19 rules, but club manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said on Friday the 18-year-old should not have been part of the squad.
Video footage this month showed Greenwood and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden allegedly inviting women to their hotel rooms after England’s 1-0 Nations League win over Iceland in Reykjavik and both players were sent home.
“I’ve spoken to Mason, what we speak about and discuss will be between the two of us,” Solskjaer told reporters ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash against Crystal Palace.
“The kid had a fantastic season, just come through. I’ve worked and the club worked hard, we gave Mason enough time on the pitch and, exposure in the media.”
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta conceded ahead of Saturday’s game at home with West Ham United that captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang decision to extend his stay with the club was a welcome boost.

Bayern Munich's Thiago comes to Anfield," Liverpool have signed Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich on a long-term contract, the Premier League champions said on Friday.
British media reported the deal will cost Liverpool around £20 million with £5 million in add-ons.
Thiago, 29, spent seven seasons with Bayern and played in last season’s Champions League final victory over Paris Saint-Germain.
Moments after sealing the move, Thiago told liverpoolfc.com: “It’s an amazing feeling. I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here. When the years are passing, you are trying to win as much as you can — and when you win, you want to win more. I think this club describes what I am as well; I want to achieve all of the goals, win as many trophies as possible.
“It also [has] this kind of family (feeling) that I need because we (like to) have a very close relationship with the club and I think I will feel this, I will have this feeling, with this club as well.”
The 29-year-old, who also has 39 caps for Spain, spent seven seasons at the Allianz Arena having transferred to Germany from FC Barcelona, where he began his career.
In total, Thiago has won nine league titles, two Champions Leagues and two Fifa Club World Cups with his respective previous teams.
He added: “I must adapt to the team as fast as I can in the situation and the context that we are living right now.
“Everything is more compact and we started a little bit later, but still it is football and I think we have to mix all the big things up, all the good things we have. I will help the team in a defensive and offensive (way) and also in a mental aspect.
“(The fans) are not more excited than I am, for sure not! It is not about saying words, it is about doing the things. I will give my heart on the field to my teammates, the club and also to the fans.”
Liverpool face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday but Thiago is unlikely to feature in that Premier League match.                     ",sports
Washington Sundar considers himself lucky to be part of tournament," Washington Sundar’s international debut happened quickly as he earned his India cap just around eight months post his IPL debut.
Acknowledging the “wonders” the IPL has done to his life since his maiden season in 2017, the 20-year-old off-spinner considers himself fortunate to be a part of the tournament, especially at a time most of his contemporaries back home are in the dark because of the domestic schedule thrown haywire by the pandemic.
For the Royal Challengers Bangalore bowler, life in the bio-bubble and other restrictions in the UAE aren’t a challenge at all.
“They haven’t been challenging, to be honest. Because, the ultimate thing that matters is playing in the IPL and we have that opportunity now.
“Not a lot of players get this opportunity. We have a lot of them back home who don’t really know what to do, especially in the next few months with very less cricket (likely) to happen. We are all really very lucky that the IPL is finally happening this year,” Washington told The Telegraph from Dubai.

The youngster, as of now, has got a fair amount of chances in T20Is, having made 23 appearances for India. But as far as ODIs are concerned, he has donned the Indian jersey just once.
Striving to cement his place in the white-ball format, Washington had made full use of the lockdown period by working on his skillsets.
“That period was all about motivation for me because I knew for a fact that I had a lot of time to keep getting better at a lot of aspects. I did train a lot and I worked on different skillsets.
“Those five months were really amazing in terms of preparation and I am happy I used them to full potential,” he emphasised.
Among the RCB spinners, Yuzvendra Chahal has been his teammate — even in the Indian team — for quite some time now. What Washington aspires to learn from the leg-spinner is the latter’s “smartness” and the “attitude” he carries.
“I think he (Chahal) is very smart and knows exactly what to do against different batsmen and in different conditions,” Washington stated.
Also, the presence of England spinner all-rounder Moeen Ali and in-form Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa too will be an advantage both for him and RCB, Washington agreed.",sports
Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis breaks 26-year world record," Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis broke Sergey Bubka's 26-year-old outdoor world record.
Duplantis cleared 6 meters, 15 centimeters (20 feet, 2 inches) at the Golden Gala Pietro Mennea meet in Rome with his second attempt, besting Bubka's mark of 6.14 meters (20 feet, 1 1/2 inches) set in Sestriere in July 1994.
Nicknamed Mondo, Duplantis already holds the indoor world record of 6.18 meters (20 feet, 3 1/4 inches) set in Glasgow in February but Bubka's classic outdoor mark was viewed by many as the ultimate test. World record finally! It is so cool, Duplantis said.
I wanted to get over these 6.15 so badly. Everybody kept talking about it, it was a big chip on my shoulder ... When I did it, it was more relief than joy.
The 20-year-old Duplantis, who was born and raised in the United States, came agonizingly close on his first attempt before clearing the bar on his second.

It is crazy, Duplantis said. ""It has been a long time coming. Coming into the season we did not know if we were able to do any competition at all. This world record is really unexpected and I am very grateful.
Duplantis was a child prodigy who broke age-group records on his way to joining the pole vaulting elite. He chose to compete internationally for Sweden, his mother's home country. He won the silver medal at last year's world championships.
World champion Karsten Warholm again narrowly missed out on Kevin Young's 28-year-old world record in the men's 400 hurdles but the Norwegian keeps getting close.
Warholm ran a meet record 47.07 seconds, less than three-tenths of a second off Young's record of 46.78 from the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
It's my third best time ever and you know running low 47s on the regular is awesome, Warholm said.
So I'm really happy and this season has been a good experience for me. Warholm ran 46.92 in Zurich last year and bettered that in Stockholm last month with a time of 46.87.
The toppling of the longstanding record appears almost inevitable.
I'm quite used to the talk now and I just got to love it because it shows that I'm in a really good place, the 24-year-old said.
Just being able to talk about the world record and being that close is an amazing feeling.
Warholm was more than 1.5 seconds faster than Ludvy Vaillant of France, with Estonia's Rasmus M gi third.
No fans were allowed in because of the coronavirus pandemic and that affected the lineups too, with the men's 100 noticeably lacking some of the high-profile names.
Akani Simbine won in 9.96 seconds, ahead of Arthur Ciss and Filippo Tortu, while double Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah won the women's event in a world-leading 10.85.
Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda set a Diamond League record of 7 minutes, 26.64 seconds to win the men's 3,000, beating Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway and Australia's Stewart McSweyn. All three ran personal bests, while Kiplimo and Ingebrigtsen also set national records.
Italy's Edoardo Scotti was first in the men's 400 with a personal best of 45.21. Lieke Klaver of the Netherlands also set a personal best of 50.98 to win the women's race.
Andrew Pozzi of Britain beat American duo Freddie Crittenden and Aaron Mallet in the men's 110 hurdles, while Nadine Visser triumphed in the women's 100 hurdles.
Femke Bol of the Netherlands won the women's 400 hurdles. Britain's Jemma Reekie triumphed in the women's 800 with countrywoman and big favorite Laura Muir only finishing third, behind Hedda Hynne of Norway.
Ukrainian pair Andriy Protsenko and Yuliya Levchenko won the men's and women's high jump, respectively. Nick Ponzio of the United States was first in the shot put.",sports
Indian Premier League: The show must go on. Let’s play," Twelve seasons earlier, the “supranational” Indian Premier League brought about a turnaround that altered the dynamics of cricket forever. It recalibrated the entire economics of the sport as India emerged as the financial powerhouse in world cricket. Twelve seasons on, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s reliance on the money-spinning league continues to grow amid its razzmatazz, celebrity status and the entertainment factor.
So much so that even in a year ravaged by the pandemic, the IPL remains the source of sustenance of not just a handful, but a large part of the sporting community in the country.
A Rs 4,000 crore-loss was what the BCCI simply couldn’t afford and hence decided to shift the league to the UAE once hosting it in India became untenable. The franchises agreed though it did upset their carefully laid plans.
Take the case of Mumbai Indians. The defending champions added seamers Trent Boult and Nathan Coulter-Nile despite having the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Mitchell McClenaghan in their ranks. The prospect of playing in Indian conditions where certain wickets aided seam movement and reverse swing in the evening prompted their decision while leaving them short on the spin front — which could prove to be their handicap on UAE’s slow and dry wickets. Beside Krunal Pandya and Rahul Chahar, they will have to depend on the talented unknowns — left-arm spinner Anukul Roy and leg-spinner Prince Balwant Rai.
Rohit Sharma conceded on Thursday that it would be tough to make up for Lasith Malinga’s absence. Limited spinning options could only add to his worries when it comes to defending small totals.

The extreme heat and humid weather could be another hindrance. AB de Villiers has already voiced his worries about the “challenging conditions”. The players’ fitness will be put to the test and Chennai Super Kings could suffer the most since several of their members are over-35.
Having lost to Mumbai Indians by one run in a last-ball finish last season, the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led franchise has already been handicapped by the exit of Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh.
The slow moving legs could only have got slower this season and it will take a lot of effort from Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Ambati Rayudu, Kedar Jadhav and Ravindra Jadeja to steady the batting line-up.
There’s lot of talk about Ruturaj Gaikwad but he has hardly been tested at this level. Much will depend on Ravindra Jadeja’s versatile abilities and Dhoni’s big stage temperament to see them through. Head coach Stephen Fleming on Friday said Dhoni was in “top shape” and ready to lead the side into Saturday’s opener against Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi.
The Super Kings’ attack will prove to be any team’s envy though the lack of a specialist off-spinner could prove to be their bane.
Leg spin options Imran Tahir, Piyush Chawla and Karn Sharma are best suited for this format while Josh Hazlewood and Lungi Ngidi along with left-arm pacer Sam Curran brings in the sought-after variation to the attack.
Hazlewood and Curran’s participation though is unlikely for the opener in cricket’s ‘El Clasico’ because of Abu Dhabi’s strict quarantine protocols. The duo landed in Dubai from Manchester on Thursday.
Two-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders will largely bank on the combination of new coach Brendon McCullum and skipper Dinesh Karthik. They also have recruited a shrewd cricketing brain in England’s World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, who should be part of the leadership group when it comes to strategy and planning. If KKR decides to have Shubman Gill as opener along with Sunil Narine, they have to quickly sort out Morgan and Andre Russell’s batting positions. Promoting the West Indian will have its advantages but Karthik will also have to play the finisher’s role to perfection. Don’t forget they failed to cash in on some of the big moments, thereby missing out on the playoffs berth last season.
Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav could be KKR’s trump card though they possess a decent pace attack with the inclusion of Pat Cummins.
There’s a lot of interest surrounding Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals and whether they will make the playoffs.
The Royal Challengers certainly have a more balanced look this time besides having a good man-manager in New Zealander Mike Hesson as coach.
RCB possess arguably the most explosive top-order in Virat Kohli, Aaron Finch and AB de Villiers. “We’ve got a great balance of experience, the skill required for T20 cricket and the youngsters in the team who are eager to take up the responsibility,” Kohli said recently.
The Ricky Ponting-coached Capitals remain the only side that hasn’t ever made the final. Ponting put his money on youth by elevating Shreyas Iyer to the helm midway last season.
This time they have added Test specialists Ajinkya Rahane and Ravichandran Ashwin and their fortunes will depend largely on how the pair adjust to the format. Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant and Prithvi Shaw provide the cutting edge along with a varied spin option.
If spin is the flavour of the season, Sunrisers Hyderabad have a potent attack. Rashid Khan, Shahbaz Nadeem and Mohammad Nabi could prove to be handy against quality opposition.
The trio of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow and Kane Williamson form a formidable batting line-up to go with Manish Pandey and Mitchell Marsh in the middle-order. The challenge for coach Trevor Bayliss, under whom Knight Riders won both their titles, will be to find the right combination when it comes to overseas players.
Having finished with the wooden spoon in two of the last three editions, they seem determined to turn the tide this season. The presence of Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini and Chris Morris have bolstered their pace attack. If Moeen Ali and Yuzvendra Chahal can spin a web around the batsmen, it will be tough to restrain Kohli's men.
Rajasthan Royals have carried the unpredictable tag right through, as have Kings XI Punjab. But both have master strategists to guide them — Shane Warne for the Royals and Anil Kumble for Kings.
 The Royals possess stars in Steve Smith, Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler while there’s uncertainty surrounding Ben Stokes’s availability. But with no big names among the homegrown talent, their chances seem restricted this time.
Kumble, the only Indian head coach in this IPL, will be keen to make his mark given his grit and immaculate planning. Kings XI Punjab captain KL Rahul can afford to sit back and relax when it comes to backroom strategy.
With the presence of Glen Maxwell in the middle order they can stun few of the more fancied teams with their depth in batting and bowling. Mayank Agarwal and Rahul can be ominous for the opposition at the top and veteran Chris Gayle can threaten to rule on his day.
The start will be important but maintaining the momentum will be crucial during this 53-day tournament. It will boil down to consistency, persistence and ability to dominate.
The year 2020 has already thrown up umpteen surprises, mostly unpleasant, but a new IPL champion would be a good surprise for the tournament.

Royal challenge for the IPL crown," For a team which has always boasted of a galaxy of stars, the IPL crown has eluded the Royal Challengers Bangalore.
For Rajasthan Royals, it’s time they do an encore of 2008 with the impact players they have in their ranks.
Both teams will bank heavily on their English and Australian recruits as they hope for a change in fortunes in the emirates. Looking at Virat Kohli (above)’s achievements, one can only wonder how the team’s performance, especially in the last three editions, has been so mediocre. To be fair to Kohli, it’s their bowling that has often led RCB down along with some questionable team selections.
Finch’s role
Australia limited-overs captain Aaron Finch will not just galvanise RCB’s batting strength, but lend extra support to Kohli and AB De Villiers in terms of dealing with the spin-friendly conditions.
‘Young AB’ Philippe
After Adam Gilchrist and Steve Smith spoke highly of Josh Philippe, the 23-year-old Aussie keeper-batsman earned accolades from De Villiers too. “I see a lot of similarities with the way he plays and how I used to when I was younger,” said AB.
Effective spinners
RCB have Dale Steyn, Umesh Yadav and young Mohammed Siraj in their pace arsenal, but it’s their spinners who are likely to play a greater role given the conditions. Kohli will bank on Yuzvendra Chahal, Adam Zampa and Moeen Ali to tweak it for him.
Last season: Eighth
Captain: Virat Kohli
Head coach: Simon Katich
Major signings: Aaron Finch, Dale Steyn Royal Challengers Bangalore
Since their triumph in the inaugural edition, a second IPL crown has remained elusive for the Royals, although they did make the play-offs on a few occasions thereafter. Last year was a major disappointment as they finished second from bottom. That too, with the presence of the illustrious quartet of Steve Smith, Jos Buttler (below), Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer in a fair share of matches.
Smith, Stokes availability
A key question is: from when will the Royals be able to field Steve Smith, who is nursing concussion symptoms, and Ben Stokes, away in Christchurch to be with his ailing father, together in the XI?
Surprise picks
The young trio of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Akash Singh and Kartik Tyagi — who were all impressive in the U-19 World Cup — could be the X-factor.
David Miller and Tom Curran should boost the side —  Miller can play the finisher’s role.

"Rohit Sharma, Quinton de Kock to open: Mumbai Indians coach Mahela Jayawardene"," Mumbai Indians coach Mahela Jayawardene has confirmed that Rohit Sharma will continue to open the innings with Quinton de Kock during this edition of the IPL in the UAE. Rohit, however, said that he was ready to bat at any position.
There has been a lot of speculation on this since the defending champions added Chris Lynn to their ranks during the December auction.
“Lynn is a great addition to the squad, but the combination of Rohit and Quinton did a phenomenal job for us last season,” Jayawardene said during a virtual news conference from Abu Dhabi.
“They complement each other well, they’re consistent and both of them are experienced. They’re good leaders as well, so why would you want to fix something that isn’t broken? We will continue to go with that.
“Lynn as an option gives us flexibility in the squad and that’s what we’ve always done. We try and add more value to the team, give more options so that we can be unpredictable when it comes to tournaments and big matches. Quinton and Rohit as a combination have been brilliant.”
Rohit though kept all options open.
“I opened for the entire tournament last year and will continue to do that,” the captain said. “As a team, we keep all options open. I’m happy to do what the team wants. I enjoy batting at the top of the order and I’ve been doing it for a while. But even when I play for India, the message to the management is to not close any door and keep all the options open, so I'll do the same here.”
Rohit and Quinton had opened in 15 of Mumbai’s 16 games last season aggregating 565 runs at an average of 37.66, including five half-century stands.
Rohit felt the conditions would play a crucial role as he expects pitches to “tire down” as the tournament progresses.
“It’s about understanding pitches and conditions, that is crucial so we are putting a lot of emphasis on that,” he said. “Eventually the pitches will play a big part, so understanding and adapting quickly is important.
“The weather is so hot and humid, the wickets will tire down. Having played the Asia Cup couple of years ago here, I certainly experienced that between the first game and the final there was a lot of difference in how the pitch was behaving. We will certainly expect the same here.
“It’s going to be a long tournament, we know how many matches are being played at each venue so the wickets will definitely tire down, and the slowness of the pitch will be a big factor. For us, all the talk happening in our group is based on all of that... We need to adapt how to play cricket on those kinds of pitches, what lengths to bowl, which shots to pick, what will be the percentage shot and ball.
“It’s not just the spinners but I think even the seamers will have a lot of assistance. Not the seam or swing movement, but there will be some reverse swing that we’re expecting. The way I look at it, we’ve got good balance and variety in our bowling attack. The same goes for the batting as well, you need to understand shots that will give you runs on this pitch,” Rohit explained.
He is expecting a “great contest” in the opener against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday. “CSK are probably one of the successful IPL teams and you can’t take them for granted... They will come out all guns blazing. None of us have played cricket for months now, so obviously everybody wants to start on a high.
“So, we will be expecting a great contest between the two and we need to focus on what we need to do as team and get all our bases are covered,” Rohit asserted.
He conceded that the “incomparable” Lasith Malinga, who is IPL’s highest wicket-taker and has opted out this season, will be missed given his “unbelievable” past performances.  
“I don’t think it is easy to come and fill his boots. He has been a match-winner for Mumbai. I have said it many times, whenever we sort of find ourselves in trouble, Malinga was the one to bail us out from that,” Rohit said.
“His experience will be missed, what he did with MI is unbelievable and it is unfortunate that he is not a part of the team this year. We have got the likes of (James) Pattinson, Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohsin (Khan) and these are the names that we are looking to replace Malinga with. But obviously what Malinga did for Mumbai, it is not just comparable.”
The Mumbai Indians captain dismissed talk that they didn’t have quality spinners except for Krunal Pandya, Rahul Chahar and Jayant Yadav.
“We’ve got a youngster in the auction this year... Prince Balwant Rai, he looks quite exciting. Anukul (Roy) has been part of the team for a while so we have a few options. We’ve got some quality spinners in our group. Hopefully they can explore conditions if need be and all these guys have experience playing domestic cricket in India.”",sports
Owe fans some joy: Virat Kohli on IPL," Royal Challengers Bangalore will take the field to bring joy to everyone watching this IPL amid all the tension due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To this end, playing before empty stands don’t really matter, even though it’s going to be “a strange feeling”, captain Virat Kohli stressed.
“Of course, it’s going to be a strange feeling playing in empty stadiums. But that feeling has changed somewhat after having gone through a lot of practice sessions and a couple of practice games as well.
“At the end of the day, you understand that you started playing for the love of the game. Now you have a chance to bring a lot of joy to people. All external factors then become irrelevant.
“The crowds are an amazing part of any sport, but that is not what you play for eventually,” Kohli said during a webinar on Thursday, where his teammates Parthiv Patel and Devdutt Padikkal were also present along with RCB chairman Sanjeev Churiwala.
The skipper maintained there wouldn’t be a drop in RCB’s intensity level because of empty stands. “Our intensity level or passion won’t drop just because there are no crowds. There is a larger reason as to why this is happening and we are going to stay true to that,” Kohli stated.
As a mark of respect for all those who risked their lives in this pandemic, the RCB jersey and the ones they wear during practice will have #MyCovidHeroes inscribed on them. The jerseys will also be auctioned to support Give India Foundation.
Asked about the mental state of players after having been in the bio-secure bubble for quite some time, Kohli said that acceptance is the biggest change that he has experienced in the prevailing circumstances and that has helped him and his teammates stay relaxed.
“Acceptance is the biggest change that I have experienced. Even in this bio-bubble, the first time we spoke was about being appreciative of the things that are in front of us. We have accepted that this is what we need to do. We are part of the bio-bubble and these are things we can afford to do.
“So I think all of us have become really relaxed in this environment now because of that acceptance. I haven’t seen people getting sad or upset here. Everyone has had a smile on their faces,” Kohli said.",sports
High-profile CVs for East Bengal head coach post," Renowned coaches like Sven-Goran Eriksson, José Pékerman, Eusebio Sacristan and Robbie Fowler have applied for the post of East Bengal’s head coach.
The century-old club is all set to become the 11th team of the Indian Super League after it became clear that the consortium of East Bengal and its investors Shree Cement is the lone bidder for a place in the country’s No. 1 league.
Swede Eriksson is a former England coach, while Pékerman managed Argentina in the 2006 World Cup and also guided Colombia to two World Cup finals (2014 and 2018).
The list doesn’t end here. Former India coach Stephen Constantine and Spaniard Mario Rivera, who was Quess East Bengal’s coach in the latter part of the last season, are also in the race.
“More than 10 foreign coaches, who are famous footballing minds, have already mailed their CVs,” one source told The Telegraph.
“The management though is yet to take a final call on the new coach. The investors are happy that famous names have showed their interest in becoming East Bengal’s coach.
“They are now waiting for the official announcement of East Bengal’s entry into ISL. Once that happens, the management will zero in on the coach,” the source informed.
The source added that once the name is finalised, team-building exercise would gather pace.
“After a series of meetings between the club officials and representatives of the investors, it was decided that the coach would be given a free hand in the signing of players,” the source said.
The tricky issue would be how to go about with the players East Bengal had signed before Shree Cement came on board. It’s unlikely that all of them would find a place in the new set-up.
“The new coach will be mailed video footages of the already-signed players. It would be the new coach’s discretion whom to keep and who would be shown the door,” the source said.",sports
Two-match ban for Neymar," Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar has been given a two-match ban for striking out at Olympique de Marseille’s Alvaro Gonzalez in last Sunday’s fiery 0-1 defeat in Ligue 1, organisers said on Wednesday.
The league’s statement added that defender Alvaro was being investigated after Neymar accused the Spaniard of using racist language towards him during the match, in which a total of five players were sent off following a mass brawl in stoppage time.
PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa got a six-match ban, the heaviest sanction of all, while Marseille defender Jordan Amavi was banned for three matches.
Neymar was automatically suspended from Wednesday’s 1-0 win over Metz — Julian Draxler headed home deep in stoppage time.

IPL: Quarantine hurdle for Kolkata Knight Riders," Different sets of quarantine rules in Abu Dhabi and Dubai could frustrate Kolkata Knight Riders’ plans of getting their England and Australia cricketers on board for the first few matches of the IPL.
The players landed in Dubai late on Thursday evening but the Abu Dhabi government has so far refused to relax their 14-day quarantine rule regardless of the result of the Covid-19 tests.
The Knight Riders along with Mumbai Indians are the two franchises which are based in Abu Dhabi. While Mumbai Indians do not have any player on that chartered flight from Manchester, the Knight Riders have Eoin Morgan, Pat Cummins and Tom Banton.
The Dubai government, however, has agreed to relax the rules and those staying there will now have to undergo 36 hours of quarantine after arrival from the United Kingdom provided the PCR test result is negative. The logic behind such relaxation is that the players are travelling from one bio-security bubble to another.
Sources have told The Telegraph that Chennai Super Kings could also face problems in fielding their players coming from the UK since the opener against Mumbai Indians will be in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Sam Curran and Josh Hazlewood are part of the Super Kings’ squad.

The Knight Riders had faced a similar problem on landing there last month but the players were allowed to practise within the bio-security bubble after seven days following negotiations with the Abu Dhabi authorities. It remains to be seen if something similar can be worked out this time too.
The Knight Riders’ first match has been slotted for September 23 against Mumbai Indians in Abu Dhabi.
“The number of Covid cases has been on the rise in Abu Dhabi and the Emirates in the past few days. The Abu Dhabi government doesn’t wish to take any risk. Each emirate has different sets of rules and you can’t do much about it,” said someone in the know of things.
“The Abu Dhabi government has already relaxed a lot of rules for the IPL.
“For example, they have done away with the compulsory border testing procedure for the franchises on match days which has been a huge boost.”
The players who will benefit from the 36-hour quarantine are Jason Roy and Marcus Stoinis of Delhi Capitals; Glenn Maxwell of Kings XI Punjab; Jonny Bairstow, David Warner and Mitch Marsh of Sunrisers Hyderabad; Rajasthan Royals’ Steve Smith, Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler; Moeen Ali, Aaron Finch and Adam Zampa of Royal Challengers Bangalore.",sports
Mourinho coy as Bale pursues return," Jose Mourinho was keen to take the credit Wednesday for Real Madrid signing Gareth Bale. The Tottenham Hotspur manager was more coy on the team’s moves to bring the forward back to London.
Bale’s agent, Jonathan Barnett, has revealed that he is in talks with Tottenham about a deal for the Wales star to play for the club again after seven years away.
“Gareth still loves Spurs,” Barnett said on Tuesday. “We are talking (Spurs, Real and Bale’s camp). It’s where he wants to be.”
Mourinho said he was not involved in any discussions. “Gareth Bale is a Real Madrid player and I don’t comment on players from other clubs,” Mourinho said.
“That is not my job to have contacts with agents. So honestly I don’t want to comment on that — especially regarding players who are players from other clubs.”
Tottenham sold Bale to Madrid in 2013 for 100 million euros (then $132million) — months after Mourinho left the Spanish giants.
“I tried to sign him for Real Madrid which was not possible during my time there,” Mourinho said. “But the president (Florentino Pérez) followed my instinct and followed my knowledge and, the season I left, he brought Gareth to the club. There is no secret on that. Even Gareth knows that.”
Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is trying to find a way of re-signing Bale in a move that could see Madrid attempt to take Dele Alli as part of what would constitute the most eye-catching deal of the transfer window.
One proposal that would interest Madrid is for Bale to return to Tottenham on loan, paying 50 per cent of his wages, with Alli moving in the opposite direction and the Spanish champions paying 100 per cent of his salary.
Whether that interests Levy remains to be seen, but it would allow Spurs to re-sign Bale and pay him £300,000 a week, half of which would be financed by the saving made on Alli’s wages. It would leave open the question of what happens to both players at the end of this season — although that would be shaped by their performances over the next eight months.
Bale endured his worst season at the Spanish club in 2019-20 with only three goals in all competitions.
The Welshman has a contract until 2022 and was set to make a lucrative move to the Chinese Super League last year before the transfer was scuttled when Madrid made a last-minute decision to insist on a transfer fee rather than terminate his contract.",sports
Calm Novak in Round III," World No. 1 Novak Djokovic turned the page on his contentious US Open exit and began his claycourt season with a convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory over wild card Salvatore Caruso in the second round of the Italian Open on Wednesday.
Nine-time champion Rafa Nadal showed little signs of rust when he played his first match in 200 days as he beat fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta 6-1, 6-1.
Djokovic was disqualified in New York after accidentally hitting a line judge with a ball during his fourth round match against Pablo Carreno Busta.
On arrival in Rome, an apologetic Djokovic vowed to be “the best version” of himself on and off the court and he kept his emotions in check against local hope Caruso.
Djokovic broke Caruso’s serve in the eighth game before serving out the opening set. Caruso dropped his serve in a see-saw third game of the second set which lasted nearly 12 minutes.
With momentum firmly on his side, top seed Djokovic broke his opponent for a third time in the match before celebrating victory by blowing kisses into the empty stands at the Foro Italico.
Teenager Lorenzo Musettistunned three-time Grand Slam winner Stan Wawrinka 6-0, 7-6(2).

Maxwell & Carey heroics," Alex Carey (106) and Glenn Maxwell (108) stitched a magnificent 212-run partnership that helped Australia snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and also clinch the ODI series 2-1 at Old Trafford on Wednesday.
Courtesy the two centurions, Australia, reeling at 73/5 at one stage in pursuit of 303, shocked England to win the game by three wickets.
This was Maxwell’s second ODI hundred, while for Carey, it was his maiden century in the 50-over format.
Both batsmen, though, had their stroke of luck. Carey, when only on nine, was taken comfortably by Adil Rashid at third man with the team total being just 87 in the 20th over. Unfortunately for England, Jofra Archer, who had a forgettable time out in the middle, had overstepped.
Maxwell too was dropped, by Buttler, when on 44 off Rashid’s bowling. England would only look back and rue those missed chances, which went on to cost them the game.
England still didn’t give up, getting both Maxwell and Carey out as Australia needed 10 off the final over for victory. But Mitchell Starc hit the first ball of the deciding over, bowled by Rashid, for a maximum over long-on. And Australia just couldn’t lose from there.
Earlier, Jonny Bairstow struck a brilliant 112 and underpinned another innings rebuild with Sam Billings as England recovered from losing two wickets from the first two balls to set Australia a daunting target.
Starc removed Jason Roy and Joe Root off successive deliveries to leave England in early turmoil on a glorious afternoon, while both Eoin Morgan (23) and Buttler (8) also departed cheaply.
From 96/4, Bairstow and Billings (57) put on 114 runs for the fifth wicket to bring England right back into the match — just as they did in the first ODI last Friday when sharing a stand of 113 in defeat.
Brief scores: England 302/7 in 50 ovs. (J. Bairstow 112, C. Woakes 53 n.o.; M. Starc 3/74, A. Zampa 3/51). Australia 305/7 in 49.4 ovs (A. Carey 106, G. Maxwell 108; C. Woakes 2/46). Australia won by 3 wickets.",sports
Khawaja hits out," Australia batsman Usman Khawaja believes criticism of him as a “lazy” player is rooted in racial stereotypes and thinks cricket needs to do more to attract players from more ethnically diverse backgrounds.
“I always had that ‘lazy’ undertone when I was growing up and I think part of that was my relaxed nature but part of it was also because I was Pakistani, and subcontinent people were seen as lazy, not doing the hard yards and what not,” he told cricket.com.au.
Khawaja has been asked to join a Cricket Australia working group looking at increasing diversity in the game.
“When it comes to diversity ... I think we’ve been okay at it but we’re still just not quite there,” he said.
“The racism has been both overt and casual but I had the confidence to speak up when something didn’t feel right, and I know not everyone does,” said Khawaja.

AB wary of the heat," AB de Villiers believes the biggest challenge for all teams in this IPL will be adjusting to the hot and humid conditions in the UAE.
In an interview on the Royal Challengers Bangalore Twitter handle, the South African star said: “I am not really used to these kind of conditions.
“It’s very hot... Reminds me of a Test match we played in Chennai once where Viru (Virender Sehwag) scored 300 (319, in March 2008). It was one the hottest weather conditions I’ve experienced in my life.
“The humidity here is similar to that, even at 10 in the night. When I arrived here, I checked the weather conditions of a few months and it seems to be getting better.
“It is definitely going to play a part and you have to make sure you have the energy for the backend of the innings or last five overs of your bowling spell.”
Playing before packed houses in India is something De Villiers said he would miss very much.
“All of us are used to playing in front of crowds at the big stage. There’s certainly an amount of adrenaline that gets pumped into you when it gets really loud, especially at the Chinnaswany when the RCB fans gets going. It’s difficult to stop the RCB team then. No doubt we’ll miss the crowd.
“But I won’t say I am not used to playing before empty stands. In fact, I have played a lot of cricket in empty stadiums. I grew up like that.
“It’s only in my international career that I have played in front of crowds,” the former Proteas captain said.
Asked whether there could be a drop in the standard with players returning after a long break owing to the pandemic, De Villiers replied: “Not at all. In the 3TC (in South Africa), I’ve faced some of the best bowling in the last three to five years. The bowlers were churning out yorkers and showed some great skills with pace, variations.
“I think they are all very hungry.”",sports
Samson fixed on job ahead," At the first-class level for almost nine years and making his international debut in 2015, Sanju Samson has so far donned India colours on just four occasions.
All four of his India appearances have been in T20Is. After his debut versus Zimbabwe in Harare, the 25-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman from Kerala had to wait for almost four-and-a-half years for his next international game.
Impressive knocks at the domestic circuit did earn him India berths. But he had to remain as a back-up keeper-batsman most of the time before being finally picked in the XI for a home T20I versus Sri Lanka and two inconsequential matches against New Zealand earlier this year.
Samson, though, is in no mood to crib as all that matters to him at present is a good, successful IPL, where he has been a consistent performer for Rajasthan Royals since last year. And to make his case stronger for more opportunities in India’s final XI, he knows he needs to keep scoring runs in the IPL as well as in other competitions.
“Well, playing for India on a regular basis is obviously my goal and to be there I know I need to score as many runs as possible across competitions. The IPL happens to be the tournament I’ll be playing now and it’s also a really competitive one.

“So it’s important I score runs in the IPL or anywhere else and give myself the best possible chance,” Samson told The Telegraph from Dubai.
Having Jos Buttler as a teammate in Royals is well and truly a privilege for Samson as he does look forward to learn more from the Englishman who’s one of the best keeper-batsmen today in the white-ball format.
“It’s wonderful to have been around someone like Buttler and he has been really kind to talk to me about a lot of things regarding the game and a few other things outside cricket too.
“I have observed him a lot and learnt several things regarding how he prepares himself and his response to pressure situations in the game. This season again, I hope to gain a lot from his presence and work together for the Royals,” Samson emphasised.
Samson is also not too concerned with the stiff competition he could face from other keeper-batsmen in this IPL, especially Kings XI Punjab captain KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant of Delhi Capitals.
“See, I don’t believe in comparing myself too much with others. I just want to focus on my own game and maintain good momentum in the tournament,” he explained.
Adapting to the slow wickets in the UAE, Samson agreed, will be a challenge. But he’s game for it.
“I’m always looking to adapt to the situation of the game. However, I do like to play my strokes. So, it’ll be a challenge to bat on those surfaces. It’ll be vital to be mentally switched on at all times and keep my head in the right space.”",sports

"Knights to Kings, test for coaches"," The last time the IPL was held in the UAE, in 2014 when 20 matches were held in the emirates, KKR claimed the title under Gautam Gambhir’s leadership. Five years on, the franchise is hoping for a repeat of that.
KKR have finished in the IPL playoffs four times and reached the final — and won —  twice, in 2012 and 2014.
The Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise has since undergone a massive transformation with Brendon McCullum taking over as head coach this year and Dinesh Karthik stepping into his second season as captain.
McCullum’s role
The former New Zealand captain is coming fresh from his success with the Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League. McCullum shares a special relationship with the Knights having scored the tournament’s first century in 2008 for them in the opener, and there’s a belief that his aggressive mindset will rub off on the players.
There’s no doubt that KKR planned their side to perfection during the December auction, having roped in Eoin Morgan and Pat Cummins. Both have the ability to swing things their way though the slow wickets could prove to be a hindrance for the Australian fast bowler.
The Morgan factor
England’s limited overs captain has a T20I strike rate of almost 140 and his prowess was evident during the series against Australia. No wonder he will be the perfect lieutenant to Karthik.
KKR’s main problem will be slotting their four foreigners to give proper balance to the side. Andre Russell is a certainty as is Narine, and they will have to choose two from Morgan, Tom Banton, Cummins and Lockie Ferguson.
Finisher’s role
Russell and Karthik can provide impetus in the middle overs but the former’s role in the batting order will be tricky and could be the deciding factor. There’s already talk that Russell will be allowed to bat up the order but then KKR will need someone to play the finisher’s role to perfection. KKR has often been guilty of loosening the grip in tight situations and someone has to step up to avoid this.
Spin options
Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav are expected to be match winners on the slow surfaces. If Narine can stifle the batsmen and Kuldeep provides the breakthroughs, there will be no stopping KKR. That in no way can undermine their pace battery. Besides Cummins and Ferguson, Kamlesh Nagarkoti can surprise the batsmen with his raw pace.
Last season: Fifth
Captain: Dinesh Karthik
Head coach: Brendon McCullum
Major signings: Eoin Morgan, Pat Cummins The franchise has perennially borne the “underachievers” tag despite having a balanced side. Faulty planning and under performance of their players have been the reasons behind them reaching the play-off stage only twice, in 2008 and 2014.
Mentor Kumble
They are once again being touted as the underdogs because of the subtle mix of youth and experience and the presence of a brilliant support staff led by the master tactician Anil Kumble.
This will be Kumble’s first coaching assignment since his unceremonious exit from the national team. New captain KL Rahul has already made it clear that Kumble will be doing most of the planning.
Rahul’s batting
The captain has been a consistent performer for the franchise during the last couple of years and will be their batting mainstay. Rahul has been in prime form smashing 659 runs at an average of 54.91 in 2018 and 593 runs in 14 matches in IPL 2019.
He is adept at attacking against both spin and pace and his form will determine KXIP’s progress in the tournament. Their best two overseas players are Nicholas Pooran and Glenn Maxwell along with Chris Gayle though there remains a big question mark over the Universe Boss’s form at almost 41.
There will also be Mayank Agarwal at the top of the order. The Karnataka opener will be keen to prove himself in this format after his exploits at the Test level. Sarfaraz Khan can be a handy batsman too. The talented youngster was in superb form in last season’s domestic circuit, and if he can continue in the same vein, Kumble can surely breathe easy. Assistant coach Andy Flower’s presence could also work to his advantage.
Good attack
Not just the batting, their bowling is fairly balanced with Mohammed Shami and Sheldon Cottrell to lead the attack. Bengal pacer Ishan Porel’s addition has been good with his wicket-taking abilities at the domestic level. Chris Jordan will also come in handy to fill in when required. The spin attack includes Mujeeb-ur Rahman, the Caribbean Premier League’s second highest wicket-taker. Ravi Bishnoi, the young leg spinner, will also be under the spotlight.

Tiger aims to roar back," Tiger Woods hopes to snap his run of lacklustre performances at the US Open this week, nearly a year after his last PGA Tour victory.
Woods has yet to finish in the top 10 of any tournament since the sport returned after being suspended due to the novel coronavirus, while his last victory came at the Zozo Championship last October when he equalled Sam Snead’s record of 82 PGA Tour wins.
“This year I really haven’t putted as well as I wanted to, and the times I did make a few swing mistakes, I missed it in the wrong spots,” said Woods.
“I’ve compounded mistakes here and there that ended up not making me able to make pars or a birdie run, and consequently I haven’t put myself in contention to win events.”
The 44-year-old has enjoyed one of the more enduring careers in golf, despite four back surgeries that had once put his future in the sport in doubt.
Woods, who has 15 Majors — three short of Jack Nicklaus’ all-time record, said last month that he was looking to clean up his game ahead of the US Open — which was pushed back from June to September due to the Covid-19 outbreak
He told reporters on Tuesday, however, that he was not trying any radical new approaches to putting.
“I have changed the routine and some of the things that I’ve done over the years, but I still go back to what my dad always taught me, which is obviously putt to the picture,” said Woods.
“Whatever I’m working on at that particular time, once I get out there and I putt, just putt.”
Woods got his first Major after an 11-year drought at the Masters last year, showing he remains a contender on the sport’s biggest stages.
Yet Winged Foot Golf Club will offer little relief should the three-time US Open champion slip up and there will be plenty of contenders ready to pounce if he does, including world No. 1 and 2016 champion Dustin Johnson, as well as No. 2 Jon Rahm.
“The winning scores here have never traditionally been very low. The golf course is going to be hard,” said Woods. “It depends on how difficult they want to set up these pins, give us a chance at it.”",sports
Players with spark who fizzled out," The wicketkeeper-batsman from Goa made 311 runs from 9 innings at 34.55 in the Rajasthan Royals’ triumphant journey in the IPL’s inaugural season in 2008. But in the next season he collected a meagre 98 runs from 8 matches and gradually fizzled out. From being Shane Warne’s trump card in the Royals to captaining Goa’s Ranji Trophy team to courting match-fixing controversy in 2010-11 (he came out clean though), Asnodkar has had quite a ride.

Present day: Last heard, the 33-year-old is still trying to make a comeback into the Punjab Ranji Trophy side.
IPL career: Matches 44, Wkts 40, Best 3/13, Avg. 27.15, Eco 7.02 In the 2009 IPL, this left-arm pacer made headlines for his slinging action and toe-crushers. As an 18-year-old then, he earned Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne’s trust and famously bowled the last over of a match against KKR, with the opposition needing 7 to win. He conceded 6 runs and the match went into a Super Over, the first ever. But he struggled in the following seasons because of his controversial bowling action. He last played in the IPL in 2011.

Frank Lampard praise for Reece James & debutant duo Timo Werner and Kai Havertz," Chelsea manager Frank Lampard heaped praise on defender Reece James and said he was happy with the debuts of Germany forwards Timo Werner and Kai Havertz after a 3-1 win at Brighton & Hove Albion on Monday.
Chelsea looked shaky at times in their opening Premier League match of the season but a superb goal by 20-year old James to make the score 2-1 soon after the break swung the contest and had Lampard purring with delight.
“It had me off my seat and we needed it, we weren’t at our best in that period,” Lampard told Sky Sports. “Reece has got that in him, he is a player of such quality. You try and get him in areas where he can be a threat.
“If you analyse the fact that we’ve been together as a team for four days, to expect everything to click on Day One is difficult. We showed determination and that is a game we might have dropped points in last year.”
Chelsea were on the backfoot for much of the first half but took the lead against the run of play after Werner showed a glimpse of his talent, racing past Mat Ryan to win a penalty as the Brighton keeper fouled him.

Jorginho converted the spot kick, and after Leandro Trossard equalised, Chelsea enjoyed a moment of magic from under-21 international James to restore their lead before Kurt Zouma’s deflected shot sealed the contest.
Havertz, who worked hard in a three-pronged line behind Werner which included Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount, was substituted in the 80th minute but Lampard was happy with the former Bayer Leverkusen forward.
“I liked Kai Havertz,” said Lampard. “It’s not a game where you come away with some vintage moments and there’s a lot on his shoulders but you saw glimpses of what he can do.
“Everything I have seen from him is spot on and his quality will come through. He’s hugely talented.”
Lampard pointed out that despite the wealth of their attacking talent, Chelsea were still a work in progress and unlikely to challenge champions Liverpool for the title.",sports
Eye on Smith for decider," Steve Smith is recovering from his head injury but is no certainty to be recalled for Australia’s ODI series decider against England, head coach Justin Langer said on Tuesday.
Smith missed the first two matches after being hit on the head by a ball at nets last week. The decider is on Wednesday at Old Trafford.
“He (Steve) is definitely tracking in the right direction and we are hopeful he will be right for Wednesday,” Langer told reporters in an online interaction.
“He did all his running, some high speed running, worked hard as part of the protocols. He has ticked every box at the moment.”
England won the second ODI on Sunday by 24 runs to level the three-match series after the visitors, chasing a modest target of 232, suffered a dramatic collapse.

Australia opener David Warner has struggled for form, scoring six, six and nought in his last three innings of the white-ball tour. He has been dismissed in all four matches he has played by Jofra Archer, who has now taken the lefthander’s wicket seven times in 10 internationals, including three in last year’s Ashes.
“It’s been a great contest, isn’t it?” said Langer. “Davey, he is a superstar. He is an incredibly important part of our side, so I am sure he is working over-time to certainly be up for the decider.”
The penultimate ODI also underlined that this England side has a lot of character to clinch victory from any position, no matter how tough it is.
“We have earned respect across a four or five-year period. I think teams do realise we can reel them in from any position and the game’s not done until they get over the line.
“We have found that in this series and also in the T20I series. We have got that respect, I suppose,” all-rounder Chris Woakes emphasised.
“We have that character and belief in the dressing room that we can win from any position. A few years ago, we probably felt we could only win from that position with the bat whereas now we can do it with the ball as well.
“There have been times in this series when we feel we haven’t played our best cricket across the two games. So hopefully, we can put in a full, big performance in the final game,” Woakes added.
It has also been a wonderful summer so far for Woakes, as he has performed across all formats. “I’m pretty pleased with how it’s gone, to be honest,” he said.

‘Fear’ of Cummins holds key for Kyle," Kyle Mills played international cricket for three more seasons after Pat Cummins made his debut in 2011. The duo have never been on-field rivals, but that hardly matters for the New Zealander.
Mills, the current bowling coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders, is concentrating on the positives that Cummins brings to the group and the way he could inspire the young quicks in the side.
The Aussie speedster also evokes the “fear factor” for the opposition, considering how he has been bowling since his comeback to international cricket, Mills emphasised.
“Pat’s a very good cricketer. He came on the scene very young, picked up a lot of injuries and was out of the game for quite some time. But obviously, he went away and made himself fit and got focused, and turned himself into a No. 1 (Test) bowler. And we have got him at his peak... at his prime,” Mills told The Telegraph from Abu Dhabi.
“Pat has a good 18 months or two years at the top of world cricket and I certainly feel he’s still there without any question. He brings a presence to this group and he also brings fear factor for the opposition because they know he is the premier fast bowler in world cricket right now. That’s not just exciting for us, but also something for our young bowlers to look up to,” the former New Zealand pacer, who played 19 Tests, 170 ODIs and 42 T20Is, stressed.

Cummins’ story and how he bounced back after being laid low by injuries time and again is a perfect example for KKR’s young pace brigade, particularly Prasidh Krishna, Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi, Mills believes.
“I really enjoy working with young cricketers, for I always find they’ve got more scars. Quite often even experienced cricketers also have scars, and whether they have learnt from those and then made amends in their careers determines if they can become great cricketers.
“Pat has been through so many ups and downs — in terms of form, injuries — and now he is the No. 1 (Test) bowler in the world and has been amazing in the past 24 months. Young guys can learn a lot from him. It’s early days in their careers,” Mills said. Like Cummins, all-rounder Andre Russell too is expected to play a pivotal role for the two-time champions. Mills, however, reminded that it’s important to manage Russell’s workload and not put much pressure on his shoulders.
“We all know big Andre carried a few niggles last year. He is so important to the group in terms of batting, bowling and fielding. He is a great fielder as well. But we need to manage his workload and shouldn’t put too much on his shoulders... Because if you do that, people break. We need to keep him fresh and in the zone.” Talking about Kuldeep Yadav, who would also play a crucial part on the slow wickets in the UAE, Mills feels bigger boundaries in Dubai and Abu Dhabi could make matters easier for the left-arm spinner.
“Just like any cricketer who comes in the breakout season, people become aware of your strengths and weaknesses. They research and work out what you can and can’t do. So Kuldeep has been going through those challenges and it’s a good time for him to make a mark again.
“Barring Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi grounds have bigger boundaries than the ones in India. I think that will help Kuldeep,” Mills said.",sports
Is the next-gen ready to take over the Big Three of men’s tennis?," Hushed whispers had started since 2016 and that’s when I first remember curiously looking up two new names — Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem. Who were they? Could they finally break the monopoly of the tennis trinity comprising three excellent vintages in the form of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic? I remember sitting in Mumbai then with my friends and placing my usual bet on Federer for Wimbledon 2016 amid other wagers on the Djoker (Nadal was out with an injury) and Andy Murray — the losers had to treat the winner to Keema Pao from Kyani’s and pastries from Theobroma. That’s when I first took note of Zverev and Thiem when one of my friends insisted on adding their names — he didn’t hope to win the bet but he wanted it to be known that time was nigh for the fall of the old guard.
Since then, these two names have been joined by the likes of Stefanos Tsitsipas, 22, and Daniil Medvedev, 24, more recently, as the most promising candidates to take over the spots of the usual suspects who have dominated the pro-tennis scene until now. And 27-year-old Thiem’s victory at Flushing Meadows on Monday morning (IST) against Zverev, 23, has added some credence to that conjecture. Sure, it took four years since catching the public eye for one of them to win a Grand Slam and six years for the world to get a new champion other than Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, Murray and Stan Wawrinka, but it must be noted that they had started forging this path earlier than that.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Austrian Thiem had broken into the top 10 in 2016 and the 6’6” German Zverev, within the next 10 months. Thiem has lost two French Open finals to Nadal in 2018 and 2019 before losing to Djokovic at this year’s Australian Open. The Russian Medvedev had made it to the US Open final last year, where he eventually lost to Nadal in a thrilling five-setter, while the Greek Tsitsipas won the ATP Finals last year. Most importantly, one must note that each of the members of the holy trinity have faced defeat in the hands of the aforementioned next-gen talents. Perhaps these facts are what famously made Federer say this last year during the ATP Finals — “What I like is that I’m seeing big improvements now. Not like there were none beforehand, but now they are playing with the big boys and really able to challenge us, beat us, having good rivalries also within each other, which I think is important for them to improve as players.”
Tsitsipas’s single-handed backhand, crisp forehand and propensity for the net are all things that often get him compared to the much older Federer but are also things that can come in handy for him to forge a legacy akin to the Swiss someday. Thiem is already regarded as a probable second-best clay court player after Nadal and is known for his power-packed forehand. His performance on Monday’s final in New York also showed his stamina, despite limping towards the end of the four-hour affair from a cramped knee as he managed to hold it together to win the match from being two sets down. Meanwhile, Zverev has a huge serve and is quite agile on his feet. If New York could be a lesson for the German, then let it be that he needs to probably work on keeping it together during those crucial points and the importance of maintaining his serve. Medvedev is building himself up as a gritty baseliner who uses the depth of the court for strong strokes. And apart from these four promising younger talents, there’s also the case for Israeli 21-year-old Denis Shapovalov and 25-year-old Aussie, Nick Kyrgios — if he cared enough, that is. 
Having said all of that, it might not be far-fetched to surmise that tennis pundits and fans alike, including yours truly, might still not be jumping to anoint Thiem or Zverev as anyone’s heir apparent just yet, given how Federer and Rafa both skipped this year’s US Open and Djokovic’s disqualification from the tournament. But I am still willing to give the next generation the benefit of the doubt, simply because of their sure and steady performances till now. Many might also regard the French Open this year as the actual litmus test as King of Clay Nadal vies for his 13th Roland-Garros title and a surely-seething Djokovic takes a go at redemption. Apart from the excellence derived from experience, one key element that has always deterred the younger group of players from claiming the tennis throne is possibly their trouble with fitness. In fact, it is ironic that Federer at 39, Nadal at 34 and Djokovic at 33, despite perhaps taking longer to recover after marathon matches, are still better at holding their game and serves (and nerves) better during such high-pressure scenarios.
If Thiem manages to feel his legs again in time for the French Open, he will be walking on to the clay courts with both the familiarity of having been there for two consecutive finals and the unfamiliarity of the weight of the world watching to find out if he can only win a Grand Slam sans Nadal, Djokovic and Federer in the fray. As a fan of the sport though, I sincerely wish for tennis to have as bright a future as its present and past for which it is pertinent to be optimistic for the young ’uns. Maybe it’s a tad too early to say that riding on Thiem’s shoulders, the new era has finally arrived but the US Open Men’s Singles final 2020, if not anything else, surely heralds one.",sports
Dominic Thiem wins US Open," A US Open unlike any other finished unlike any other — with an unprecedented fifth-set tiebreaker as Dominic Thiem became the first man in 71 years to win the final after dropping the opening two sets.
In a wild comeback that seemed improbable, Thiem, a 27-year-old Austrian, vanquished Germany’s Alexander Zverev, 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (6).
Thiem edged out Zverev, 23, in a fifth-set tie-breaker that capped a four-hour marathon that included golden opportunities for the German to win and left both men battling cramps in the final moments.
Thiem won his first Grand Slam tournament in his fourth major final. A critical factor was that this time neither Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal nor Novak Djokovic stood on the other side of the net.
The Austrian, one of a group of promising younger players who have long failed to topple those aging giants, became the first currently active player in his 20s to win a Grand Slam event. He is the first new Grand Slam champion in six years.

With Zverev serving for the match at 5-3 in the fifth set, Thiem won the first two points to put the big German on the ropes. He then forced him into one too many errors as Zverev could not close the door for the championship.
Although this tournament may always be known for the absence of Federer and Nadal and Djokovic’s disqualification for unintentionally hitting a line judge with a ball, Thiem’s name will be etched in the same font as past champions. There was no discount on his $3 million winner’s check.
But a victory in these circumstances does leave a lesser impression. What made Naomi Osaka, who claimed the women’s trophy on Saturday, such a star is, in large part, that she won her first major title against Serena Williams, one of the greatest players of this era.
Thiem, though, doesn’t view it this way. “I achieved a life goal and a dream I had for many, many years,” he said.
The game’s ultimate pressure cooker, a fifth set tie-breaker, was a microcosm of the match itself. Zverev took an early lead, Thiem battled back to take control, then Zverev fought off two match points to knot it at 6-6. But Thiem slammed one last searing forehand winner and Zverev sent one last backhand wide to give Thiem the championship.
A weary Thiem dropped to his back way behind the baseline and covered his face with his hands.  When he arose, he was met by Zverev, who walked around the net to clasp hands, then embrace his friend and foe, two sights rarely seen in this era of social distancing. Thiem then rested his head on the shoulder of the taller Zverev.            
“I wish we could have two winners today,” Thiem said. “I think we both deserved it.” He is the first man to win the American Grand Slam tournament after trailing 2-0 in sets in the final since Pancho Gonzalez did it against Ted Schroeder in 1949 at an event then known as the US Championships.
Zverev broke into tears during the trophy ceremony. “It’s just tough you know,” he said. “I wish one day that I can bring the trophy home.”
For years, the leaders of the sport and its fans have wondered what tennis will look like once the storied careers of Djokovic, Federer and Nadal finally end. If Sunday was an indication, there will be an endless, nerve-jangling brawl to see who can fill their shoes.
No one can, of course. It is unlikely that tennis will ever have three players vying for the title of the sport’s greatest playing at once. But under a clear sky and an unfortunately empty Arthur Ashe Stadium because of the coronavirus pandemic, Zverev and Thiem showed that the next phase of this sport will not be short on the high-stakes drama and test of nerves that have defined the game for decades.
On paper, the match was Thiem’s to lose. His blistering backhand became the shot no one could answer, the one that left the best players in the world shaking their heads, their spirits crushed as yet another winner whizzed down a sideline.
Zverev, on the other hand, had looked eminently beatable, especially during his error-filled semi-final, when he was down two sets and hitting 75 mile-an-hour second serves into the net. He somehow escaped — and laughed when he did — not quite believing he could have played so poorly and still landed in a Grand Slam final.
If Thiem can walk in less than two weeks, when the French Open begins, he will be among the top three favourites there as well, along with the 12-time champion Nadal and world No. 1 Djokovic.
While Osaka’s victory was a reflection of the present in women’s tennis, Thiem’s victory is a projection of the future in the men’s game.",sports
Power play of success for Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings," Mumbai Indians are the most successful team in the IPL with four title wins, a testimony to their years of planning and ability to manage their resources intelligently. However, they have been found wanting when it comes to defending the title. While Chennai Super Kings have successfully done it in 2010 and 2011, Mumbai have never managed to win on two consecutive occasions.
That will be Rohit Sharma’s biggest challenge going into the 13th edition of the IPL.
They certainly possess firepower at the top with the signing of Chris Lynn, who had shown some glimpses of his hard-hitting abilities during his days with Kolkata Knight Riders. With Rohit for company, the pair can threaten to often decide the outcome of a contest in the Powerplay overs itself. For variety, there will also be Quinton de Kock’s ability to execute some stunning innings.
If the withdrawal of Lasith Malinga came as a shock, Nathan Coulter-Nile’s addition this season will provide potency in the death overs.
Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult can be vicious with their pace and accuracy; there’s also Mitchell McClenaghan and Hardik Pandya. McClenaghan, the left-arm pacer, proved last season that he thrives on bowling at the death.
Mumbai Indians though have limited spin options. Rahul Chahar and Jayant Yadav would be the specialists with Krunal Pandya chipping in at times. This could hurt them given the pitches are likely to get slower as the tournament progresses.
The franchise is always known to back young talent and this time the focus will be on three signings — batsman Mohsin Khan, pacer Digvijay Deshmukh, and all-rounder Prince Balwant Rai .
Their all-rounders comprising the Pandya brothers and Kieron Pollard provide Mumbai Indians with balance. Pollard’s ability as a finisher was on display during the recently concluded Caribbean Premier League.
If Mumbai Indians are to retain their title, the onus has to be on Rohit’s form and his tactical acumen in guiding this high-profile franchise.
Last season: Champions
Captain: Rohit Sharma
Head coach: Mahela Jayawardene
Major signings: Chris Lynn, Nathan Coulter-Nile A SWOT analysis of Chennai Super Kings will reveal that a majority of their key players are above the 30-year bracket. The impetus may not be on youth but there’s no dearth of experience or desire to win matches.
How else would you describe a side that has been filled with some stalwarts in the game’s shortest format — Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Imran Tahir, Dwayne Bravo... Besides winning the title thrice, they have reached the play-offs in each of the ten seasons they have participated.
They will be handicapped by the absence of Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh this season but a lot will depend on Dhoni to help them tide over this crisis.
A lot will also depend on Watson at the top of the order. Be it in the 2018 final where he made 117 not out against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final or last year’s title showdown against Mumbai Indians when he was run out for 80, he has a habit of turning up for the big games.
CSK will also bank on Jadeja’s all-round abilities and Bravo’s penchant to turn the tide from seemingly lost positions. 
Australian Hazlewood’s impeccable accuracy with the new ball and how he combines with Deepak Chahar and Bravo will determine their fate on the slow and insipid wickets of the UAE.
CSK are known to rebound after a hesitant start and Dad’s Army, as they have affectionately been called, can never be discounted with. As Dhoni has always mentioned, age is just a number.
Last season: Runners-up

5 youngsters who have to shine bright in IPL," Devdutt Padikkal (RCB)
He has the numbers to speak for him. Padikkal, the 20-year-old left-handed top order batsman from Karnataka, finished as the top scorer in both the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last season. A tall frame who likes to drive and pull, Padikkal accumulated a total of 1838 runs from 33 matches across all formats last season. Simon Katich, who is a part of the RCB coaching set-up, has already said that Padikkal’s talent “excites” them. It’s up to the youngster now to impress us.
T20 record: Matches 12, Runs 580, Avg. 64.44, S/r 175.75 Ravi Bishnoi (KXIP)
Another 20-year-old who is rated highly by experts. His exploits for the India U-19 team at the World Cup earlier this year was breathtaking — 17 wickets in 6 matches. He was almost unplayable. Will he get a chance to play in this IPL? Well, with Anil Kumble as the head coach of KXIP, wrist-spinner Bishnoi will surely get the right tips to present his case. The wickets in the UAE will suit the spinners and that should help Bishnoi, who is armed with a subtle googly. That he is a good fielder as well is an added advantage.
T20 record: Matches 6, Wkts 6, Avg. 23.00, Eco 6.57 R. Sai Kishore (CSK)
You may not have heard about him much, but this left-arm spinner could be the dark horse in IPL 2020. Sai Kishore is a no-nonsense bowler and is mighty efficient in his job — he picked up 20 wickets at an economy rate of 4.63 for Tamil Nadu in last season’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he was the leading wicket-taker as well. With Harbhajan Singh opting out of this IPL, CSK might turn to Sai Kishore for the spin job. And Mahendra Singh Dhoni surely knows how to use his spinners. An MBA, this 23-year-old means business.
T20 record: Matches 22, Wkts 25, Avg. 16.76, Eco 5.45 Yashasvi Jaiswal (RR)
He was lapped up by the Rajasthan Royals for a neat Rs 2.4 crore. The 18-year-old left-handed batsman was the top scorer in the U-19
World Cup earlier this year. But make no mistake, the kid has it in him to be successful at the top level also. He was the youngest to score a List A double century when he smashed 203 off 154 balls playing for Mumbai against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He hit 17 fours and 12 sixes in that innings, enough indication that he has the firepower needed to light up T20 cricket.
T20 record: Hasn’t played yet. Kamlesh Nagarkoti (KKR)
He was a hot property post his performance in the 2018 U-19 World Cup. But despite being roped in by KKR at that young age, pacer Nagarkoti almost receded into oblivion after being plagued by injuries. KKR captain Dinesh Karthik says a fit-again Nagarkoti is clocking “150 clicks” and that his fielding is “on par with Ravindra Jadeja”. Nagarkoti no doubt is precious to his franchise. It needs to be seen how his explosive pace works on the usually-lifeless UAE tracks, but this is one young lad who would be mighty hungry to prove himself.

Novak: Will move on but default a big lesson," Novak Djokovic learned “a big lesson” after being disqualified from the US Open for unintentionally hitting a line judge in the throat with a ball.
The incident eight days ago marked a stunning end to Djokovic’s 29-match winning streak and his bid for an 18th Grand Slam title.
 “I’m working mentally and emotionally as hard as I am working physically,” Djokovic said on Monday at the Italian Open. “I’m trying to be the best version of myself on the court and off the court and I understand that I have outbursts and this is the kind of personality that I have and the player that I have always been.
“I’m going to take this in as profound as possible for me as a big lesson. I’ve been thinking about it. I’ve been comprehending. I’ve been talking to my team. It’s just one of these things that is just unfortunate and happens. You have to move on.”
The disqualification came during Djokovic’s fourth-round match against Pablo Carreño Busta. As he walked to the Arthur Ashe Stadium sideline for a changeover, trailing Carreño Busta 6-5 in the first set, Djokovic — who was the top seed — angrily smacked a ball behind him. The ball flew right at the line judge, who dropped to her knees at the back of the court and reached for her neck.

“It was totally unexpected and very unintended as well,” Djokovic said. “When you hit a ball like that you have a chance to hit somebody that is on the court. The rules are clear. So I accepted it. I had to move on and that’s what I did.
“I don’t think I’ll ever forget about it, because it’s one of those things that stays in your memory for the rest of your life. But I don’t think I’ll have any major issues coming back to the tour and being able to perform well and hit the tennis ball.”
Djokovic has an opening-round bye in Rome. Nine-time Rome champion Rafael Nadal is on the opposite side of the draw. Nadal has offered some sympathy for Djokovic after his shock default.
“The consequences have been always the same. Nothing new on that. Novak was unlucky. The rules says clearly that’s a default,” Nadal said at a news conference.
“Sorry for him. He had an opportunity there. It’s very unfortunate, very unlucky situation. But it’s important to have the right self-control on the court.”                                ",sports
Ligue 1: Neymar among five sent off in stoppage time," Neymar was among five players sent off in stoppage time as Marseille beat bitter rivals and Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain for the first time in nine years.
PSG star Neymar got a straight red in Marseille’s 1-0 win following an altercation with centre half Alvaro Gonzalez on Sunday.
Neymar was sent off following a video replay showing he aimed a jab to the back of Gonzalez’s head. As he went off, Neymar told officials that he had been racially abused.
“It’s a serious wrongdoing if that’s the case but I don’t think so,” Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas said. “What we saw, what was visible, is that (Angel) Di Maria spat (on Gonzalez).”
With apparent reference to Gonzalez, Neymar later tweeted: “The only regret I have is not hitting the face of this idiot.” .

In a later tweet, Neymar said: “It is easy for the VAR (video review) to see my ‘aggression’” and added he was subjected to offensive insults of a racist nature.
 “Neymar told me that it was a racist insult. I didn’t hear anything on the field,” PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said. “Racism in life, in all domains, in sport, should not exist.”
Alvaro denied the allegation in a post of his own on Twitter. “There is no place for racism,” he wrote. “Clean race and with many colleagues and friends on a daily basis. Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field.”
In a statement on Monday, PSG urged the French league’s governing body (LFP) to investigate the matter.
“Paris St Germain strongly supports Neymar Jr who reported being subjected to racist abuse by an opposing player,” the club said.
Winger Florian Thauvin scored in the 31st minute of a tense game featuring more than a dozen yellow cards and which descended into chaos deep into stoppage time as punches and kicks were exchanged.
It was Marseille’s first victory over PSG since a 3-0 home win in November 2011.
PSG have now lost three straight games 1-0, including the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on August 23 and away to promoted Lens last Thursday.
PSG lost their opening two league games for the first time since the 1984-85 season and Tuchel may find himself under early pressure.
The game ended with PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa and Marseille counterpart Jordan Amavi sent off for fighting in the seventh minute of injury time at Parc des Princes.
PSG’s Leandro Paredes and Marseille’s Dario Benedetto soon followed before Neymar’s expulsion.
“The fight is something very serious. We will deal with that internally with our players,” PSG sporting director Leonardo said.              ",sports
Formula One: Lewis Hamilton fears for drivers," Six-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has called for a rethink on how races are re-started behind the safety car because he fears drivers are being put at risk.
Sunday’s Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello was stopped twice due to crashes, the first time after a four-car pile-up when backmarkers accelerated too soon.
Valtteri Bottas had been leading for Mercedes and controlling the pace, backing the pack up and delaying his getaway for maximum effect.
Hamilton, who took his 90th career win at the Italian circuit, told reporters the safety car lights were being turned off, effectively handing over control to the race leader, later and later.
“They’re obviously trying to make it more exciting but ultimately today you’ve seen they’ve put people at risk, so perhaps they need to rethink that,” said Hamilton, who felt Sunday was “a little bit over the limit.”

Ferrari-owned Mugello was being used for the first time as a Grand Prix venue.
Bottas said Mercedes had expressed some concern before the race, but to no effect.
“They said basically they’re going to keep doing it because it’s better for the show. I think that was the reply,” added the Finn.    ",sports
Life in bubble fine for Jofra Archer," Jofra Archer would have spent 87 days in the bio-secure bubble in England since the Tests versus West Indies that marked the resumption of international cricket.
The pacer, adjudged Man of the Match for his superb bowling in England’s series-levelling 24-run win versus Australia in the second ODI on Sunday, isn’t too concerned for having to go into another bubble — in the UAE — owing to his IPL commitments with Rajasthan Royals.
Rather, he views the IPL as a welcome change where the bio-bubble would not be “as mentally draining”. “We’ve been playing Test cricket for two months, so to get a chance and see some fresh faces and a different challenge and the prospect of not being out there for the whole day is good.
“We got a break and went into a different format (T20Is and ODIs versus Australia), so you don’t go crazy in your mind doing the same thing day in day out. The change was much welcome.
“We’ve got two more days in the bubble. Some people have some time off and some go into another bubble (IPL) as well. This in itself is another change and it won’t be as mentally draining,” Archer was quoted as saying by a cricket-specific website.

About England’s strategy while bowling, Archer said: “We’ve been versatile with the ball. It was a slower deck, so we just need to bang it halfway down without being too funky.”
The strategy worked. Australia pacer Pat Cummins said the 24-run loss was a “tough one to get your head around” with his team letting the hosts off the hook twice in the game.
“...We gave them an extra 40 or 50 runs,” he said.",sports
Giving you the low-down on all the eight IPL teams in the fray," They are the reigning champions and the most successful side in the tournament with four titles. Mumbai Indians will be aiming to become the first side since Chennai Super Kings in 2011 to retain the crown. The Men in Blue, led by “Hitman” Rohit Sharma, undoubtedly have one of the strongest sides in the tournament.
New signings: They made two star signings this season — Chris Lynn and Nathan Coulter-Nile. Though they haven’t been in the thick of things recently, both of them can become match-winners on their day. Coulter-Nile will give Rohit an alternate option in the pace attack that comprises Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult and Mitchell McClenaghan. However, the absence of Lasith Malinga is a major concern for Mumbai.
Strength: The all-rounder trio — Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya and Krunal Pandya — has made MI a pretty balanced side. Pollard’s devastating form in CPL, where he led Trinbago Knight Riders to their fourth title, will be a big boost for Mumbai. Hardik has had his fair share of injury troubles since the conclusion of the World Cup 2019 and he would be keen to get back his old self. The best thing about the franchise is they have kept the core of their team intact. Rohit, Bumrah and Hardik will remain the foundation of their charge along with overseas stars such as Pollard and Quinton de Kock. If Lynn and de Kock get going, MI won’t have to bother about flying starts.
Weakness: The only area of concern for Rohit Sharma can be the spin department. Rahul Chahar is a quality leg-spinner but if he has an off day, Mumbai will have to depend on off-spinner Jayant Yadav and part-time spinner Krunal Pandya who are yet to establish themselves as match-winners.
Key player: Rohit Sharma. The India opener has matured as a captain since he first took over as Mumbai Indians skipper from Ricky Ponting in 2013. He has four IPL titles (2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019) under his belt and though he has played many valuable knocks up the order, it’s his captaincy that has become more crucial for Mumbai. He understands his own game very well and his calmness will play an instrumental role for MI.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Sunrisers have established themselves as one of the most consistent teams in the league since their maiden title triumph in 2016. They reached the play-offs in all three years after that and became runner-up in 2018. The Hyderabad franchise has reinstated David Warner as their captain and replaced Tom Moody with Trevor Bayliss as head coach. Bayliss won the title in 2012 and 2014 with KKR.
New signings: They didn’t go for big names this time except Aussie all-rounder Mitchell Marsh. Instead they have bought a host of young talents such as India under-19 captain Priyam Garg, batsmen Virat Singh and B Sandeep, West Indies spinner Fabian Allen, and all-rounders Sanjay Yadav and Abdul Samad. Priyam has already proved his potential and might find a place in the squad to boost the middle order. Marsh can be a perfect replacement for Shakib Al Hasan, who was released by the franchise.
Strength: Their biggest strength is the opening pair — Warner and Jonny Bairstow. Together they amassed 1,137 runs last season, with four century partnerships and two 50-plus stands. Sunrisers also have a strong middle order comprising Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey and Mitchell Marsh. However, skipper Warner might have to choose between Bairstow and Williamson if he wants to take advantage of the all-round ability of Marsh. The franchise also has great variety in the bowling department led by Bhuvneshwar Kumar. They have quality Indian seamers in Sandeep Sharma, Basil Thampi and Khaleel Ahmed besides a reliable spin attack with Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Shahbaz Nadeem in the squad.
Weakness: Losing nerve in crunch ties is something Sunrisers have to overcome. In the last three years, they lost twice in the Eliminator and once in the final. Inconsistency of their pacers is also an area of concern. Sandeep Sharma and Khaleel Ahmed often proved expensive last year.
Key player: David Warner. Warner is undoubtedly one of the most explosive batsmen in the shorter format of the game. On his day, Warner can destroy any bowling attack. He is the go-to man for Sunrisers. He has hit over 500 runs in each season he’s played since his IPL debut in 2015 and he’s the only player in IPL to have won the Orange Cap thrice. Super Kings have already suffered a few setbacks after landing in Dubai. But with ‘Thala’ Dhoni at the helm, they will always remain a serious contender for the title. They are the most consistent performers in the history of IPL. The franchise has claimed three titles and made eight appearances in the finals with a 100 per cent qualification record to the play-offs. They are the only side to have successfully defended a title.
New signings: CSK picked up Josh Hazlewood, Sam Curran and Piyush Chawla in the last auction to bring more balance in the squad. Hazlewood can form a lethal pace attack with Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur, while the all-round ability of Curran and Chawla can come handy for Chennai.
Strength: The biggest strength of the Chennai side is their ability to bounce back and win games from almost impossible situations. Dhoni has always relied on his veteran players and it has paid him rich dividends. The 2018 edition, when CSK returned to the IPL after a two-year ban, showed how experience matters in winning big matches. Mahi’s boys might feel at home in the UAE as the pitches in the Arab country can turn out to be slow just like the one they have at Chepauk. They have a strong spin department that boasts of Imran Tahir, Ravindra Jadeja and Mitchell Santner. The addition of Piyush Chawla will only add variety to their attack. However, they will surely miss Harbhajan Singh, who has ruled himself out of the tournament.
Weakness: Batting might be a point of worry for MSD as his batsmen were less consistent than usual last season. Most of CSK’s batting mainstays are past their prime and haven’t been in good form recently. The franchise got the biggest jolt when Suresh Raina opted out of the tournament. The Men in Yellow would like to see the power and flair of Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis again for a steady start to the innings. A lot will also depend on how the out-of-form Ambati Rayudu and Kedar Jadhav fare this time.
Key player: M.S. Dhoni. All eyes will be on ‘Captain Cool’ as always. He has not played any competitive cricket since India’s semi-final exit against New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup. Of late, a lot of questions were raised regarding his batting and he would surely love to answer all those with his bat as he did time and again. The fact that he has retired from international cricket might help him play freely and bring back the “greatest finisher of all time”. The Knights have always been one of the biggest entertainers at the IPL. On one hand they scripted many dramatic wins, while on the other hand they failed terribly on occasions when it mattered the most. Consistency always appears to be a problem for them. They won the title twice but it has been six years since their last triumph in 2014. The job will be more difficult this time as they won’t get to hear the ‘KKR… KKR…’ roar and Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re chants from a packed Eden Gardens in home matches. Can they match the feat of their Caribbean counterparts, Trinbago Knight Riders, who clinched the CPL last Thursday? Fingers crossed!
New signings: Knight Riders made the best use of last year’s auction to bolster their squad. They picked up Pat Cummins for a record Rs 15.5 crore that made him the most expensive overseas buy in IPL history. They also roped in England’s World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan and in-form youngster Tom Banton. Banton can provide a good start to KKR’s innings, which was an area of concern last season because of Chris Lynn’s poor form.
Strength: The Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise probably has the best ensemble of overseas players. They have two brilliant all-rounders in Andre Russell and Sunil Narine, two explosive batsmen in Morgan and Banton and two fearsome pacers in Pat Cummins and Lockie Ferguson. There will be a healthy competition among them for the four slots in the first XI. Besides the overseas stars, the Calcutta franchise has some exciting young talents such as Shubman Gill, Nitish Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi. Except Nagarkoti, all of them were impressive in the last IPL. Gill has the potential to become the middle-order mainstay, while Krishna can take more responsibility with the new ball this season. Now all that skipper Dinesh Karthik and new coach Brendon McCullum have to do is find the best combination for the team.
Weakness: Too much dependence on Russell and Narine and the lack of experienced India players have been plaguing KKR for long. Narine has suffered an injury during CPL recently and it might trouble the Knights. Middle order remains a concern as Morgan might not always find a place in the XI if Banton opens the innings. Kuldeep Yadav also has to get back his form if Knights want to take advantage of the slow pitches in the UAE.
Key player: Andre Russell. When Russell fires, KKR wins — this almost became an adage last season. The fact that the Caribbean star got the Most Valuable Player award even when the Knights failed to make it to the play-offs says it all. Knights would love to see the Jamaican all-rounder start from where he left last season. His whirlwind knocks and crucial breakthroughs with medium pace bowling are key to KKR’s success. Some of the best T20 players have played for the Kings, but they are yet to lift the title. They finished as runner-up to KKR in 2014 and since then, they haven’t even reached the play-offs. Last year they ended up at the sixth position despite starting off the campaign well. The Punjab franchise would look to turn the tide this time with new captain K.L. Rahul and new coach Anil Kumble. They have also appointed Jonty Rhodes as fielding coach and Wasim Jaffer as batting coach.
New signings: Kings have done a great job in the auction as they roped in limited-overs specialists Glenn Maxwell, Chris Jordan and James Neesham. They also picked up in-form fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell and a few exciting young talents such as Ishan Porel and Ravi Bishnoi.
Strength: They have a strong top order and a balanced middle order in the batting line-up. The opening combination of KL Rahul and Chris Gayle was a big hit last season. If Gayle struggles, they have rising star Mayank Agarwal as another good option for the opening slot. Nicholas Pooran, Maxwell, Neesham, Sarfaraz Khan, Karun Nair, Mandeep Singh and Deepak Hooda — they have plenty of choices for the middle order too. Big hitters such as Maxwell and Neesham can play the role of finishers perfectly. In the bowling department, Kings now have some quality options in terms of pace attack as they have Cottrell and Jordan to partner with Mohammed Shami.
Weakness: Since they have released Ravichandran Ashwin, the lack of experienced spinners might worry the Kings. Mujeeb Ur Rahman has to lead the spin attack now with young talents Ravi Bishnoi, K. Gowtham, and J. Suchith for company. None of them have proven themselves as match-winners yet. Death bowling is another area that has been troubling KXIP for a long time. Though they have Jordan this time, but there is no other death-over specialist in the side. Mohammed Shami was not much successful in the death overs last season.
Key player: KL Rahul. Rahul is in the form of his life. The opening batsman was the top scorer for the franchise in the last two seasons. He scored 593 runs in 2019 and 659 in 2018, averaging over 50 in both editions. He has the ability to play full 20 overs and finish the match. He would keep finding the gaps and hitting the boundaries as long as he stays in the middle.
However, this time he has an added responsibility of leading the side. It can just bring out the best in him. They are the perennial underachievers, reaching the play-offs only four times in 12 seasons and never making it to the finals. However, thanks to a bunch of talented youngsters such as skipper Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw and Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals revived themselves last season and were considered a dark horse. But Chennai Super Kings halted their dream run in the play-off. The franchise would like to continue their impressive show this time too.
New signings: They have made some smart buys in the last auction. They picked up in-form all-rounder Marcus Stoinis, explosive batsman Shimron Hetmyer, wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey and experienced India players Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane. Their strategy was to make a nice blend of young and experienced players because relying only on youngsters cost them dearly against Super Kings in the play-offs last year.
Strength: The Capitals’ strength is their batting. Senior India campaigner Shikhar Dhawan and young turk Prithvi Shaw can make a formidable opening combination. They have a steady middle order comprising Iyer, Pant, Hetmyer and Rahane. Stoinis will give depth to their batting order and make the side pretty balanced. Their spin department also has veterans such as Ashwin and Amit Mishra, who can take advantage of the slow pitches in the UAE.
Weakness: The only point of concern for the Capitals is the lack of in-form India pacers to assist speedster Kagiso Rabada. Ishant Sharma is injury-prone and Mohit Sharma is past his prime. If Rabada has an off day, their bowling might look vulnerable.
Key player: Marcus Stoinis. Stoinis will be the man to watch out for in this IPL. The Aussie all-rounder has been impressive in the recent series against England. He also had a fantastic season in Big Bash League early this year. Stoinis amassed 705 runs in 17 matches for Melbourne Stars in the BBL, at an average of 54.23 and a strike rate of 136.62 with one century and six half-centuries, the most by any batsman in a BBL season. If he continues his form, Delhi Capitals can be a team to beat. They always boast of one of the strongest squads in the league but could never live up to the expectation of their passionate fans. The Bangalore franchise has two of the greatest white-ball batsmen in skipper Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers alongside a host of extraordinary talents, but they are yet to claim their first title. They have, in fact, made it to the play-offs only five times in 12 seasons. The last three seasons have been miserable for them to say the least.
New signings: RCB’s bowling department, especially the pacers, put up a pathetic performance last season. So the franchise left no stone unturned to boost up the seam attack during the last auction. They signed Dale Steyn, Chris Morris and Isuru Udana to put an end to the bowling woes. RCB also roped in Aaron Finch who can give them a solid start to the innings.
Strength: RCB will surely be a threat with the presence of Kohli, Finch and de Villiers in their batting line-up. All of them can singlehandedly take the team to victory. South African all-rounder Morris might be the X factor for them this season. He can play the role of a strike bowler and a death-over specialist. He can also bat responsibly in middle order. In-form Moeen Ali will only add to their strength. The spin department comprising Yuzvendra Chahal, Washington Sundar and Pawan Negi can work wonders on the slow pitches in the UAE.
Weakness: Sudden batting collapse and inconsistent bowling performance have been the major drawbacks for Bangalore. They need to find reliable finishers and strike bowlers. It’s not possible for Kohli or AB to win all the matches for them.
Key player: Virat Kohli. As always, RCB will rely heavily on their skipper. Despite achieving so many feats in international cricket, Kohli hasn’t yet tasted much success both as a batsman and a captain in the IPL. The India skipper has struggled with bat of late and his biggest challenge now is to get back his form. Kohli has to lead his team from the front if he wants to lay hands on the trophy that has been eluding him for the last 12 years. The Royals, led by legendary Shane Warne, were the first champions of the IPL in 2008. But since then they qualified for the play-offs just thrice in nine editions they played. Last year they had a forgettable campaign as they finished seventh. They made a lot of changes to the side during the auction in December, hoping to see a turnaround.
New signings: They added as many as 11 players in the auction last year. They picked up England pacer Tom Curran, South African limited overs specialist David Miller and bought back Jaydev Unadkat and Oshane Thomas to strengthen their pace attack that also features Andrew Tye and Jofra Archer. They made a smart move by taking former Knight Robin Uthappa and India’s under-19 star Yashasvi Jaiswal.
Strength: The Royals have a strong batting line-up with some big match-winners in skipper Steve Smith, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler. However, the uncertainty over Stokes’ participation in IPL remains a point of bother for the franchise. Though Smith is now not at his best in limited-overs cricket, he can hit a match-winning knock any day. Moreover, his leadership skills would surely be a big boost for the Royals. Buttler can open the innings with Uthappa or Sanju Samson. Smith might bat at number 3, which seems to be his preferred position. Teen talent Yashasvi might get a place in the XI. David Miller will also provide a depth in the batting order. However, it will be tough to fit him in the playing XI.
Weakness: The bowling department doesn’t seem to have enough firepower despite having a decent pace attack with the likes of Archer, Tye and Unadkat. The lack of quality spinners might haunt them on the slow tracks in the UAE. They have to rely mainly on Shreyas Gopal in the spin department. The main problem for Rajasthan Royals is they have too many overseas stars and very few experienced India players. Thus finding the right combination might be a difficult task for them.
Key player: Jos Buttler. Buttler has been in fine form for England in the Australia series and he has to take the responsibility of laying the foundation of a big total for the Royals. He can give the side a flying start with his ability to find the gap and hit any good length ball to the fence. He is undoubtedly one of the best openers in limited-overs cricket at present.",sports
Dominic Thiem comes back from two sets down to beat Alexander Zverev and win the US Open," In a wild comeback that seemed improbable and predictable, Dominic Thiem battled from two sets down to win the United States Open on Sunday night over Alexander Zverev, 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (6).
Thiem edged Zverev in a fifth-set tiebreaker that capped a four-hour marathon that included golden opportunities for Zverev to win and left both men battling cramps in the final moments.
Thiem, a 27-year-old Austrian, won his first Grand Slam tournament in his fourth major final. A critical factor was that this time neither Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal nor Novak Djokovic stood on the other side of the net.
The game’s ultimate pressure cooker, a fifth set tiebreaker, was a microcosm of the match itself. Zverev took an early lead, Thiem battled back to take control, then Zverev fought off two match points to knot it at 6-6. But Thiem slammed one last searing forehand winner and Zverev sent one last backhand wide to give Thiem the championship.
Thiem collapsed when it was over. Minutes later, Zverev broke into tears during the trophy ceremony as he thanked his parents. “It’s just tough you know,” he said. “I wish one day that I can bring the trophy home.”

“We both deserved it,” Thiem said.
Because of the pandemic, the U.S. Open went from a raucous celebration of the game to a quirky display of tennis purity, played without ticket-buying spectators in cavernous empty stadiums. Without crowds creating the usual ambient rumble, matches played out amid the rattle of Long Island Rail Road trains roaring past the stadium and the beep-beep-beep of trucks going in reverse in the parking lot.
Thiem, who had cruised through the tournament with frightening precision, struggled to find his rhythm at the start of the match, missing long and wide on shots that had pasted the lines for nearly two weeks.
And then everything began to go sideways for Zverev.
Zverev’s game began to show cracks late in the second set, when he served for the set and missed an easy volley and then double faulted. He took the set on his next service game, but the faltering reminded Thiem (if he indeed needed reminding) that Zverev had never closed one of these Grand Slam finals before. In fact, he had not played one.
Early in the third set, Zverev missed another easy volley on a break point and Thiem had his lifeline. Swinging with the freedom of someone with his back against the wall and nothing to lose, he began finding his targets and forcing Zverev to win points on his own.
Eight games later, Zverev double faulted at deuce and sent a soft forehand into the middle of the net that allowed Thiem to serve for the fourth set.
Quickly, it was tied up. But just when it looked like Thiem was going to run away and hide, breaking Zverev in the first game of the fifth set, he struggled with prosperity, as Zverev battled then seemingly broke away, giving himself a chance to serve for the match at 5-3. The fun of course was just starting. Capitalizing on Zverev’s twitchy serve and tentative play from the baseline, Thiem knotted the match at 5-5.
What ensued was that mix of grace and tension, of power and nerves that few other sports provide. The only question remaining was who would crack last.
With a soft ball floating around his eyes along the left sideline, Zverev did what all modern players do, running around his backhand and aiming a big forehand straight down that line. Once more, he fumbled the chance, sending the ball far beyond the baseline.
Now it was Thiem’s chance to finish it off, serving at 6-5. He did not handle prosperity all that well either, dropping the first two points and giving Zverev two chances to force a tiebreaker. He needed both, and on the second one he ripped a forehand winner to send this match to its fitting end.",sports
Hamilton’s 90th in dramatic Tuscan Grand Prix," Lewis Hamilton celebrated the 90th win of his Formula One career, one short of Michael Schumacher’s all-time record, after a crazy crash-strewn Tuscan Grand Prix on Sunday that was twice stopped and re-started.
The six time world champion’s Finnish teammate Valtteri Bottas completed the one-two for dominant Mercedes at the Ferrari-owned Mugello circuit in central Italy.
Red Bull’s Thai driver Alexander Albon, whose teammate Max Verstappen retired in the gravel at the second corner, took third place.
The race was Ferrari’s 1,000th championship Grand Prix but the best the struggling Italian team could manage was eighth for Charles Leclerc.
The first ever Tuscan Grand Prix at the Ferrari-owned Mugello circuit was stopped twice after a spate of crashes and three safety car deployments.
The red flag first came out when Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi, McLaren’s Carlos Sainz, Haas’s Kevin Magnussen and Williams’ Nicholas Latifi collided at the end of a safety car period.
Bottas had been leading for Mercedes at that point.
As the Finn prepared to accelerate away, the back-markers reacted as if the leaders had already re-started. Sainz hit the back of Giovinazzi’s car as the Alfa swerved.
“I think people were going before you’d gone,” Mercedes told Bottas.
 Sainz reported that he and the others were OK.“The crash was really scary,” he said.
 “It felt like at the back of the grid where I was that everyone in front of me thought the race was going and we were all flat out until someone realised the race was not on,” added the Spaniard.
 “It’s definitely not a nice feeling to do 280kph and suddenly find three cars in the middle of the straight.”
 The safety car was immediately deployed again and the race then halted before a standing re-start.
 The red flags came out again with 13 laps remaining, and Hamilton leading, when Canadian Lance Stroll suffered a puncture and crashed his Racing Point.
Frenchman Pierre Gasly, shock winner of last Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix at Monza for AlphaTauri, brought out the first safety car after a crash that also took out Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.
 It was the second race in a row to be red-flagged.
 Only 12 cars remained in the race.",sports
Won’t be miserable for long: Azarenka," US Open runner up Victoria Azarenka, Having clawed her way back after years of setbacks in her career and personal life, said on Saturday that she wouldn’t let her three-set loss to Naomi Osaka in the final keep her down for long.
 “I’m not necessarily disappointed. It’s just painful. It’s painful to lose. That is what it is,” the twice Australian Open champion said. “Am I going to think about it too long? Not at all. I’m not going to sit here and be miserable.”
The former world No. 1 has plenty to be happy about: After securing her first WTA title in four years at the Western & Southern Open last month, Saturday marked her first Grand Slam final appearance in seven years.
Azarenka, a US Open runner-up in 2012 and 2013 as well, returned from maternity leave in 2017 only to have a bruising custody battle with her former partner that kept her from competing in that year’s Flushing Meadows campaign.
 The unseeded Belarusian was not expected to be a top contender this year, but defied the odds nonetheless.

 “I’m a human being that has doubts, that has fears, that has different kinds of emotion which are so normal,” she said.“It’s just the difference that those emotions are not going to stop me from doing what I’m going to do.”
The 23,000-plus seats in the main arena were not entirely unclaimed, just mostly so — while fans were not allowed to attend, dozens of people who worked at the tournament attended — and the cavernous place was not entirely silent, just mostly so.
 “I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play in front of millions of people watching on TV,” Azarenka said. “Unfortunately, they're not here.”
Azarenka has scarce time to soothe the sting of defeat, hopping on a plane to Rome on Sunday, where she will face the seven-time Grand Slam title holder in the Italian Open, where she was granted a wild card entry.
 “I’m looking forward to play on clay. It’s going to be a quick turnaround, but it’s going to be fun,” she said.",sports
"Points made and won, masked warrior Osaka lifts US Open singles trophy"," Naomi Osaka had just come back to secure her second United States Open singles title. She had tapped rackets with Victoria Azarenka, thanked the chair umpire and consulted with a WTA Tour media official about the commitments to come.
Only then did she take a moment for herself, returning to the blue court where she became a star in 2018 and gingerly dropping to its surface, lying on her back, hands folded and eyes blinking as she gazed up through the open roof — all alone — for nearly 20 seconds.
“I was thinking about all the times I’ve watched the great players sort of collapse onto the ground and look up into the sky,” she said. “I’ve always wanted to see what they saw.”
Osaka, still just 22, is undoubtedly a great player already, and there was much for her to savour on many levels over the last three weeks. Much to ponder, as well, as she took on not only some of the toughest tennis players in the world but some of the thorniest social issues, as well.
She handled the pressure on both fronts and returned to the fore in women’s tennis with Saturday’s gritty 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory. She wore seven masks with different names for each of her matches to honour Black victims of violence. She said it motivated her — “I wanted more people to say more names” — and she walked on court Saturday with a mask bearing the name of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy shot and killed in Cleveland by a white police officer in 2014.
“The point is to make people start talking,” Osaka said at the award ceremony.
Osaka — with her talent and increasingly confident voice — seems to have that effect.
Her time at the top has been short but impactful, and Saturday’s victory came in radically different conditions than her first title run in New York in 2018.
In that final, she defeated Serena Williams in a tumultuous straight-set match that turned ugly when Serena clashed in Arthur Ashe Stadium with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, who called three code-of-conduct violations against the American.
The crowd, unclear on the rules and upset at the treatment of Serena, booed during the awards ceremony, leaving Osaka in tears shortly after her first Grand Slam singles title.
But Ashe Stadium was nearly empty on Saturday, as it has been throughout this unusual US Open where fans were not permitted because of the coronavirus pandemic.
What little crowd there was in attendance never became a factor, and though Osaka started very slowly against Azarenka, she gradually found her range and became the first player in 26 years to win a US Open women’s singles final after losing the first set.
The last player to manage it was Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, who rallied to defeat Steffi Graf in 1994.
Osaka, 22, who represents Japan and is based in the United States, is 3-0 in Grand Slam singles finals. With her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and improved fitness, she appeared ready to take command of the women’s game when she won the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open and became No. 1.
But she surprisingly split with her coach Sascha Bajin shortly after that victory in Australia and struggled to recapture the same sparkling form.
Last year, as she defended her US Open title, Osaka was beaten in the fourth round by Belinda Bencic. At the Australian Open in January, she played an error-filled match and was upset in the third round by Coco Gauff, then 15, an American whom Osaka had beaten in straightforward fashion at the 2019 US Open.
Osaka was in evident disarray, but then came the five-month tour hiatus because of the pandemic. Osaka, the biracial daughter of a Haitian father and Japanese mother, became deeply involved in the social justice movement, attending a rally in Minneapolis and speaking out on social networks and elsewhere. She also worked intently on her game and her fitness in her new base in Los Angeles with new coach Wim Fissette, a Belgian who has helped Azarenka and many other leading players win big titles.
“The quarantine definitely gave me a chance to think about a lot of things, what I want to accomplish, what I want people to remember me by,” Osaka said. “I think it definitely helped me out.”
Azarenka, 31, from Belarus, lost to Serena in classic US Open finals in 2012 and 2013 but rallied to defeat the 38-year-old in a ferociously contested semi-final on Thursday and started just as convincingly on Saturday.
Azarenka was unseeded and had not won a tour match in nearly a year before arriving in New York, but she is hardly a tennis outsider. She was No. 1 for 51 weeks in 2012 and 2013 and won two Australian Open singles titles before Serena reasserted herself at the top of the women’s game, and Azarenka dropped back.
She would have been the first mother to become a Grand Slam singles champion since Kim Clijsters won the Australian Open in 2011.
As Azarenka dominated the opening set, hitting nearly every first serve in play and controlling the rallies, it appeared she might win in a hurry. Osaka threw her racket at one stage in frustration as her unforced errors piled up.
“I just thought it would be very embarrassing to lose this in under an hour,” Osaka said, explaining that she told herself to “stop having a really bad attitude.”
Her mood and game improved dramatically as the final progressed, while Azarenka failed to sustain her level of play. After losing the second set and falling behind 1-4 in the third, Azarenka made one more surge, battling through a five-deuce game to hold serve and then breaking Osaka’s serve in the next game to close the gap to 3-4.
But at 30- 15 on Azarenka’s serve in the next game, the match turned for good as Azarenka started hitting shots that failed to penetrate.
Osaka won a high-velocity rally to get a break point and then converted it as Azarenka lined up a forehand, went for an inside-out winner and missed just wide. By such tiny margins are Grand Slam titles lost and won.
Osaka then closed out the victory by holding serve as Azarenka’s last shot, a backhand, struck the net to end a 13-shot rally. Osaka tapped rackets with Azarenka at the net — another sign of these changed times — and then lay on her back.
“I always see everyone sort of collapse after match point, but I always think you may injure yourself, so I wanted to do it safely,” she explained.
That seemed fitting at a tournament where staying safe was the priority, as players were tested for the virus regularly and restricted to their lodging and the tournament site.
 A champion again, Osaka made her point unmistakably on the court and off.
The sky, which she gazed at so peacefully on Saturday, is the limit.

Muskan Sethi on playing poker professionally and acing it," For a long time, poker was a game solely associated with men, especially in India. Keeping up, however, with the changing tides of inclusivity and increasing participation of women in sports among other activities, poker now boasts of an increasingly large number of female stars and role models. Trailblazing the phenomenon in India is the country’s first sponsored female professional poker player Muskan Sethi, who not only promotes it to be a mind sport but also inspires women to play their cards right. She is now the brand ambassador of the popular online poker card room, PokerStars India. The Telegraph caught up with the national award-winning poker star after a brief session on the nitty-gritty of the game, where she spoke about her journey, her routine and her decision to becomes a professional poker player. Excerpts...

Other than the lack of role models, poker is also often seen in a negative light in India. Did it prove to be a hindrance in the early stages of your career?
I got a lot of strange reactions when I started out. Even though poker was associated with gambling, the reactions that I received were never negative. Maybe the upcoming generation is more well-informed about the game because when I travel to different cities in the country, people know about me, they recognise me, they have an understanding of poker, they follow the games online and are up-to-date with the international championships too.
Another thing that I have noticed along my career is that it is never about any particular generation. People who are as old as our grandparents already play games like bridge and rummy. So, when they find out about poker, they have a sense of respect about the game, they know it is hard to master and not ‘just another card game’. I know a lady who is in her 60s and is so active on PokerStars that her husband always complains about her not having time for him (laughs).
The perception of the game is mixed. Our country is so diverse that I find it wrong to generalise the feelings around any one particular topic. The respect and recognition of the game are almost everywhere in the country. Yes, there are some pockets that don’t have a clear understanding of poker but that is solely because of the lack of awareness which, in turn, results in the lack of role models for them.

Your poker journey started with family card games before moving on to online poker games and then eventually turning pro. What was the shift like?
It wasn’t just casual games; we used to play strategic games more often, to be honest, because I was very competitive in nature mainly because I was into sports growing up. I was introduced to poker by my father and I took to it pretty quickly because, after a point of time, I was craving for that challenge that the game provided. That’s really how my journey with the game really started. From there on, I started playing online on Zynga Poker and then eventually on PokerStars. I found the transition from playing in real life with people in front of me to playing online in real time with people all around the world pretty smooth and seamless. In fact, I would say that the two complement each other — online poker can help you connect and play with and learn from players around the world, which hones the skills that you can use in live tournaments and even win a lot of cash! (Laughs) Plus, it also taught me many valuable lessons, like how people think and react under pressure and how important it is to be a good thinker as poker is a game of incomplete information that we have to make sense of and use to our advantage.

Poker has come a long way in terms of acceptance as a sport. What according to you do we still lack when it comes to picking it up as a profession?
You see, poker as a game in India is only about a decade old, and yet there are already a good number of people playing it professionally. I don’t think too many sports have this kind of a growth curve. So, while it’s on the right path, only when there’s enough awareness about the game, only then more people will understand the skill involved and then see how they can potentially make a living of it, which will then result in a higher number of professional players.
Poker not only requires meticulous thinking and quick decision-making but also an overall fitness of mind and body as sessions could last for several hours. What is your training regimen like?
To be able to see the same situation from every possible angle, and decipher it with an open mind is the most important part of poker. Apart from the technical skills and love for the game, poker players must have patience, discipline and persistence to go a long way. Becoming a professional player requires you to study the game more than, sometimes, even playing it. I have a mind coach who helps me separate thought from action, which helps me play my right game on the table. It’s very important to have a sharp mind when playing, to rid yourself of distraction and emotions when you play. I also have hypnosis sessions along with meditation to help with this. I have a fitness coach too, as stamina is very important along with a good diet that sharpens my mind and gut. Finally, a poker coach who I can discuss my strategies with. Every game, nowadays, is recorded and run through software that goes through each move and is analysed as to how differently the game could have been played.

What would be your advice to someone who wants to take up poker professionally?
It requires a dedicated approach to be a successful professional poker player. It’s easy to start but tough to sustain. Everyone’s already a poker player but not everyone can be a pro. From mastering the game, working on strengthening your mind, to keeping health in the best shape to learning from your mistakes to aiming to always be better than before, the grind never stops. But if you have the discipline and clarity, nothing can stop you.

Who are the up-and-coming Indian poker players we should look out for?
There are many players in the scene now. Look out for the players who are regularly streaming poker because they’re not just learning and growing but also helping others to grow along with them.",sports
"For Azarenka, disappointment again, but plenty of hope"," For Victoria Azarenka, a surprise U.S. Open run began to unravel in the seventh game of the second set, the 14th game of a Saturday afternoon final that had been nearly perfect for her from the start.
Her flawless first set began and ended with service breaks as Naomi Osaka came out looking like a shadow of the player who had blasted her way through her first six matches.
Tentative? Scared? Who knew?
To Azarenka, it mattered little.
The tennis court has been a place of calm over the past month for Azarenka, 31, in a life that has been full of tumult. She has spent much of the past two years embroiled in a custody fight for her 3-year-old son. Her country, Belarus, has descended into chaos after an election, criticized as fraudulent, in which the longtime president, Alexander Lukashenko — a leader Azarenka has been close with — claimed to have won 80% of the vote.
Azarenka did not touch her racket for five months and had no intention of playing in this tournament if her family situation had not been settled. “I was ready to stop,” Azarenka said of her tennis career.
In New York, though, she spent her time at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center with an all-business approach she hadn’t displayed in years. She won 11 straight matches after not having won in a WTA Tour competition in a year. She won the Western & Southern Open, the U.S. Open tuneup, when Osaka pulled out of the final with a sore hamstring.
At night, Azarenka retreated to a home she had rented on Long Island. Her mother cooked dinner. Her coach, Dorian Descloix, talked to her about life and parenting. She played in the backyard with her son, Leo. She spoke of finding joy in a game that had once left her with mostly anger and frustration and disappointment, even as she won two Grand Slam titles and ascended to the world No. 1 ranking.
And early Saturday, it looked as if this was going to be a coronation for the unseeded Azarenka, more than seven years removed from her last Grand Slam title. She had been so close at the U.S. Open before, twice losing three-set finals to Serena Williams, once when she was just two points from the championship.
“I thought the third time was a charm, but I guess I will have to try again,” Azarenka said.
Azarenka dominated the first set, 6-1, giving Osaka few openings. Instead of slugging away as she had against Williams in the semifinal, Azarenka befuddled Osaka with a mix of spins and cut shots, even the occasional moon ball, and a series of deadly angled winners that kept Osaka from digging in and playing the power-against-power game she loves.
Osaka’s first serve, so powerful and accurate in the semifinal against Jennifer Brady — and for much of the tournament — was missing in action. For a set and a half, Osaka won just 40% of points on her first serve. She swatted forehands long and batted backhands into the middle of the net. The wheels that sent her jetting across the baseline and chasing down drop shots could never get out of first gear.
And then came the seventh game of the second set. Like someone turning out the lights, the consistency that had brought Azarenka 12 points from the championship was gone. On break point, with an easy floating forehand in the middle of the court, Azarenka pushed the ball wide.
For the first time, Azarenka was on her back foot. That steady flow of free points from Osaka was gone. Osaka’s aggression was back. She aimed for the sidelines and began hitting her targets far more than she missed them. Now Azarenka was the one giving chase from corner to corner.
Two games later, it was even. Azarenka would not lead again.
Two nights earlier, it was Azarenka who had come out flat. She was behind a set against Williams in less than 30 minutes, only to storm back and knock off the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. Now Azarenka was the one whose fist pumps and high-volume self-talk could not reverse the tide.
In defeat, Azarenka was philosophical in a way that she had not been in the past, when losses ate at her self-esteem. She played hard, missed some shots she wished she had made and got beat by Osaka, now a three-time Grand Slam champion. This result, she said, does not hurt her belief in what she is capable of.
Next up is the Italian Open in Rome. She leaves New York on Sunday. After that, it’s Paris for the French Open, which begins in three weeks. She is hopeful, even if clay has never been her best surface.
“I’m very proud of the last three weeks,” she said. “I’m not going to sit here and be miserable.”

Hamilton grabs pole," Mercedes’ Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton took pole position for the first Tuscan Grand Prix at Italy’s Mugello circuit on Saturday with team-mate Valtteri Bottas joining him on the front row. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen qualified third with team-mate Alexander Albon fourth.
Charles Leclerc kept Ferrari’s head up for their 1,000th world championship grand prix, qualifying fifth at a track owned by the Italian team. Sebastian Vettel will line up 14th in the other Ferrari.
The pole was the 95th of Hamilton’s career and seventh in nine races this season, continuing Mercedes’ 100 per cent record in qualifying.
Bottas had every right to be disappointed, after lapping fastest in every practice session and then being denied a chance to go faster when Renault’s Esteban Ocon spun and brought out yellow flags late in the session.
Hamilton had secured provisional pole already with a lap of one minute 15.144 seconds, which was ultimately good enough for the top slot, while the best Bottas could manage was 0.059 slower.

"US Open: Thiem vs Zverev to give Grand Slam a new look, a new champion"," Dominic Thiem has certainly paid his dues in the long-running era of the Big Three. And on Sunday, with Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer all out of the picture, Thiem will get his next and best chance to win his first Grand Slam singles title.
He truly earned it on Friday with a 6-2, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (5) semi-final victory over Daniil Medvedev at the United States Open that was much more grinding and suspenseful than a typical straight-set affair.
“Was probably the toughest straight-set win I ever had,” said Thiem, looking drained but content at his post-match news conference.
Thiem, the No. 2 seed from Austria, had to rally from a service break down in each of the final two sets against the unpredictable Medvedev and had to save a set point in the second-set tiebreaker.
But despite pain in his right Achilles’ tendon and two falls in the match that left him shouting about his shoes, Thiem was the more balanced and reliable threat, and he will now face Alexander Zverev, the No. 5 seed, in the final on Sunday. The winner will be the first new Grand Slam singles champion in the men’s game in six years.
[Thiem and Zverev will also contest for the honour of becoming the first male Grand Slam singles champion born in the 1990s.]
It will be the first major final for Zverev, a 23-year-old German who has long been considered a superstar in the making. It will be the fourth major final for Thiem, 27, who has lost the last two French Open finals to Nadal and lost a taut five-set Australian Open final to Djokovic earlier this year.
“If I win I have my first,” Thiem said. “If not I probably have to call Andy Murray about how it is to be 0-4.”
Murray, the British star, lost his first four major finals before finally breaking through to win the US Open in 2012.
Thiem has beaten all three of the Big Three (and Murray) on multiple occasions, but throughout his career, they have blocked his path at the Grand Slam tournaments. “Definitely they are also a part of the player I became now,” Thiem said.
But this time he did not have to face any of them and will be the favourite on Sunday against Zverev, whom he has beaten seven times in nine matches, including all three of their Grand Slam duels.
Thiem defeated Zverev in their most recent match: a four-set semi-final at this year’s Australian Open.
“It’s all or nothing,” Thiem said. “The last one we had was an amazing one in Australia: two tiebreaks for me, super, super close. And I guess the main thing I have to focus on is to return good. His first serve is out of this world: so fast and so precise. So just try to get that back in play. It’s a great friendship, a great rivalry I feel with him. I’m looking forward to playing that first major final with him.”
Zverev beat Pablo Carreño Busta 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 in the first semi-final earlier Friday.
It was the first time in Zverev’s relatively short career that he had won a match after losing the first two sets. But what mattered most to Zverev was taking one more giant step toward a major title.
Zverev had never come back from being down two sets to none. Now, he is in the United States Open final.
“I think a lot of players would have gone away,” Zverev said. “Sometimes you have to dig deep. Today I dug deep, dug very deep.”
Thiem and Zverev, along with Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, are all in their 20s and have rightly been considered the most likely candidates to succeed the Big Three.
Thiem is a full-throttle competitor: a 21st-century version of his Austrian compatriot Thomas Muster, who rose to No. 1 and won the French Open in the 1990s. His beautiful one-handed backhand with its baroque follow-through gets much of the attention, but his forehand does most of the damage, and that proved true once more under duress against Medvedev.
Thiem repeatedly found an extra gear and a brighter idea that Medvedev, creative to a fault on Friday, could not match.
Zverev looked anything but likely to win on Friday in the early sets as he mistimed groundstrokes, struggled to win quick points with his heavy serve, double-faulted into the net and spread his long arms wide and looked imploringly at members of his team in the sparsely populated stands.
“I was actually looking at the scoreboard when I was down two sets to love,” Zverev said. “I was like, I can’t believe it. I’m playing in a semi-final where I’m supposed to be the favourite, and I am down two sets to love, and I have no chance, I’m playing that bad.
“So I knew I had to come up with better tennis and knew I had to be more stable.”
Zverev has proved himself in five-set matches: He is now 14-6 in them.
 But Zverev, born in Hamburg in 1997, will clearly need to play a much more complete match against Thiem than he did against Carreño Busta if he is to pose a serious threat in the final.
“I couldn’t be happier,” Zverev said of his big comeback. “But there’s still one step to go for me.”
Thiem knows that too well.
“From the moment Novak was out of the tournament, it was clear that there’s going to be a new Grand Slam champion,” Thiem said.
“From that moment on, that was also out of my mind. I was just focusing on the remaining guys left in the draw.
“Now it’s Sascha remaining, the last one.”

24th major eludes Serena again," If age, as Serena Williams keeps saying, is just a number, then so is 24. That has been her clearly stated target since she returned to the game in 2018, after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia.
She was one tournament victory short of it then, and she remains one short of it after her latest setback: a 6-1, 3-6, 3- 6 loss to Victoria Azarenka in a jewel of an US Open semi-final on Thursday night.
But whether she ever matches or surpasses Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles seems increasingly unimportant.
She has achieved plenty, and inspired many, in the nearly four years since she won her 23rd at the 2017 Australian Open, when she was two months pregnant.
“If 24 is Serena’s goal and motivation then that’s great, but she doesn’t need it,” said Chanda Rubin, a former top 10 player who is now a Tennis Channel analyst. “Her record speaks for itself. Serena has the most majors in the Open era. But she’s the kind of player who looks forward.”
Even Serena will eventually run out of runway. She turns 39 on September 26 and intends to celebrate in Paris by playing the French Open.
But her new rivals, like Naomi Osaka, are improving, and her old rivals, like Azarenka, are emboldened.
It is not a coincidence that nine of the 11 matches that Serena has played since the tour resumed last month have stretched to three sets, not an accident that she has won just one tournament since 2018 and is 0-4 in Grand Slam finals during that span, or that she failed to reach the final at this US Open even with six of the top 10 players missing from the draw.
“I think the chances get dimmer with each Slam that goes by, because of time and because, to me, she can’t play the defense she needs to play anymore,” said Pam Shriver, an ESPN analyst and former leading player.
Serena’s edge has diminished, even if her competitive fire has not. Her fight was unmistakably visible and audible in her last three matches at this strange, symbolic US Open as she scrapped and screamed and alternated stretches of full-power, full-stretch brilliance with rough patches of off-target, late-to-the-ball frustration.
It was so very hard to know what was coming — even for her, it seemed. The old cues no longer apply, but it was still quite a sight to see her try and try.
“I think it’s amazing,” Azarenka said. “There’s no other thoughts: someone who is an amazing champion going for what she wants to do. All admiration from my side.”
Serena was full of the same for Azarenka, her friend and fellow working mother.
When she lost to Serena’s sister Venus in the opening round of the WTA event in Lexington it appeared that the game might have passed her by. But she has tapped into something transcendent in a hurry: winning the Western & Southern Open, with Osaka withdrawing before the final, and now winning six straight matches in the US Open, often in grand style.
“She’s had a lot of, I would say, downs in her career,” Serena said. “She started on a lot of highs. I don’t know how she stayed positive, to be honest, so that’s a good lesson for all of us. No matter what, you just got to keep going. Hopefully she keeps living her dream.”
In her earlier years, Azarenka was so overwrought in competition that she would sometimes break into tears midmatch. But though she swore like a sailor at one point on Thursday as she failed to hold serve amid the one-way traffic of the opening set, she found positive energy when she needed it and, also, peace when she needed it.
Early in the second set, she was urging herself on and bouncing in place like she was ready to run to Manhattan if necessary. On changeovers, she closed her eyes, and she did the same when Serena took an injury timeout for an ailing left Achilles’ tendon early in the third set.
Serena’s level did drop after her brilliant first set, but above all, Azarenka’s level rose.
When it came time to serve for the match at 5-3 in the third, she double faulted to make it 30-all. Demons galore could have surfaced after all her close losses to Serena. Instead, she smiled, exhaled and came up with a service winner and an ace to finish off the greatest player of the era.
The difference this time?
“I was young, my ego was way too big, and now it’s a little smaller, and the results are coming,” Azarenka said.
She lost to Serena in the 2012 and 2013 US Open finals in this same stadium, when it was full of roaring fans instead of empty seats.
But they filled the void together on Thursday, their grunts of effort, frustration and triumph reverberating under the closed roof.
It was that kind of night: all about intensity and resilience. And in the end, there were three winners: Azarenka and Osaka, who will meet in the final on Saturday, and tennis itself.
Osaka’s 7-6 (1), 3-6, 6-3 victory over Jennifer Brady in the first semi-final was just as engrossing: full of clutch serves, controlled power and suspense.
“I always said I was going to remember this year’s US Open until the day I died,” said Shriver, who was a US Open singles finalist as a 16-year-old in 1978. “It was within inches of not happening so many times, and with what New York has been through, that they’ve been able to bring all these international athletes together has been a miraculous effort. We all want this so much to finish in a positive way and not another 2020 nightmare, and today and tonight was crazy great.”
Serena helped make it happen by committing to the tournament early. But Osaka and Azarenka will carry the load the rest of the way. They deserve it, just as Serena deserves to chase whatever she wants to chase on the courts of the world, for as long as her body and spirit are willing.

Sofia Kenin: Reigning women’s singles Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin looked sporty and chic in Fila, featuring a tank top with a striped piping and a short skirt with an overlap detailing. This year, the traditional Fila tones of red and navy are complemented by pops of green. 2. Naomi Osaka: Two-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka chose a quirky colour-blocked Nike ensemble for Flushing Meadows, part of the brand’s attempt at a ’90s throwback. With two sets of colours for the day and night matches, Osaka has been winning in style so far. She also revealed new kicks with “Home Is Where the Heart Is” written, along with her signature on them. However, what must be noted is that after becoming the first pro tennis player to suspend her game in solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement, she has brought with her to New York, seven masks (assuming she plays till the finals) with the names of seven victims who have faced atrocities due to their race in America. Her comment about it: “It’s quite sad that seven masks isn’t enough for the amount of names.” 3. Angelique Kerber: The German dressed in a white Adidas tunic with coral and pink accents, and a micro-pleated skirt, making this a simple and clean look, compared to the colours of the other brands.   4. Denis Shapovalov: In designing the neon kit for men, Nike clearly had Andre Agassi’s image in mind and Shapovalov was their best bet, considering his penchant for that ’90s baggy fit. With neon sleeves, loose fit and a hint of print on the shorts, Shapovalov carried it off well. 5. Novak Djokovic: The 17-time Grand Slam champion chose a royal blue Lacoste T-shirt and white shorts for the night and the opposite during the day for his forgettable outing in New York that got him defaulted out of the tournament. With the wide stripes on his T-shirt, the look was reminiscent of the quintessential US jersey style. 6. Coco Gauff: The youngster stepped out in a spunky flourescent-meets-burnt orange dress by New Balance, accented by silver polka dots on the skirting in continuation of the player’s #CallMeCoco line. 7. Serena Williams: The 23-time Grand Slam winner debuted an all-red look, covering everything from her hair accessories to her sweatbands and Nike set in a cherry red shade. She finished it off with a custom pair of Nike tennis shoes in shades of red, plum and white. For her day matches, she wears the same foot-to-toe style in peach, which coincidentally, is quite similar to what her sister Venus was wearing.  ",sports
Thiem predicts a ‘great match’," Second seed Dominic Thiem delivered a sublime performance to dismantle Australian Alex de Minaur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 on Wednesday and canter into the semi-finals of the US Open.
 Thiem needed a little over two hours to record the win under the closed roof of Arthur Ashe Stadium despite being put under constant pressure by De Minaur, who is nicknamed ‘Demon’ and known for his never-say-die attitude and speedy court coverage.
De Minaur advanced to the net at every opportunity to disrupt Thiem’s baseline game and while the plan worked initially the 27-year-old Austrian adjusted and started finding winners past his advancing opponent.
De Minaur’s serve was vulnerable all night and Thiem, who amassed 43 winners, converted seven of his 13 breakpoint opportunities. De Minaur could take only two of the seven chances he had to break Thiem’s serve.
Thiem will meet Russian Daniil Medvedev for a place in his fourth Grand Slam final.

Medvedev powered into the semi-finals with a clinical 7-6(6), 6-3, 7-6(5) victory over childhood friend Andrey Rublev.
 The first Russian duo in the quarter finals of a Grand Slam since Igor Andreev and Nikolay Davydenko at Roland Garros in 2007, Medvedev showed no fear during a ruthless display that sent him through to the last four without losing a set.
 No player in the Open Era has won the US Open men’s title without dropping a set.
 With Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal missing, and top seed Novak Djokovic having been disqualified for hitting a line judge with a ball, Medvedev showed why he is now the bookmakers' favourite to win in New York.
 According to Thiem: “It’s going to be really, really difficult (vs Medvedev). But I’m looking forward to that one. I think it’s going to be a big stage, a great match even if it's without fans. It’s going to be a great semi-final.”
A loose and confident Victoria Azarenka overpowered Elise Mertens 6-1, 6-0 to advance to the semi-finals where she will face a familiar foe in Serena Williams.
 Azarenka, smiling and bobbing her head along to music being played during changeovers, spread the court with 21 winners to dominate 16th seed Mertens in their first career meeting.
 She took the first set after the normally rock solid Belgian sent a forehand wide for her 13th unforced error of the frame.
 And the 31-year-old Belarusian did not take her foot off the gas in the second, running Mertens around the court and sealing the win when her opponent dumped a backhand into the net.
 Azarenka, who won her first title in four years at the Western & Southern Open last month, said she is appreciating her time on the court more than ever.
 “I don’t think I have ever enjoyed tennis, to be quite honest,” she said.
 “I felt that it was a job and something you were meant to do. Winning, you enjoy it. Losing, I was so upset and for a couple of days I couldn’t function normally. Now nothing bothers me. I can say I am feeling the moment.”
The win saw the two-time Grand Slam champion advance past the quarter finals at a major for the first time since 2013.

Vettel, winner of 53 Grands Prix, has had a tough time at Ferrari since the arrival of Monegasque Charles Leclerc, with the youngster beating him on wins, podiums, points and poles last season.
Ferrari have struggled this year but announced in May, before the season had even started, that Vettel would be leaving at the end of the year. He will be replaced by Spaniard Carlos Sainz from McLaren.
Mercedes-powered Racing Point are fourth overall after eight races, with Ferrari sixth.
 “Happy to know you’ll be around next year! Let’s finish this doing our best together,” commented Ferrari on their Twitter feed.
Sunday’s race will be Ferrari’s 1,000th world championship Grand Prix and also the 250th of Vettel’s career.
At Aston Martin, Vettel will join Canadian Lance Stroll — whose billionaire father Lawrence owns the team and is executive chairman of the British-based luxury sportscar maker famed for its association with fictional secret agent James Bond.
Vettel will not be the first world champion to have driven for the Silverstone-based team, who started out as Jordan in 1991 and have gone through various incarnations.
Michael Schumacher — Vettel’s boyhood idol, compatriot and eventual seven-time world champion — started out at Jordan in 1991.

Looking back at some of the most shocking sporting exits," Having sailed through the initial rounds at the 2020 US Open, world number one Novak Djokovic met Pablo Carreno Busta for a place in the quarters. Djokovic had started imperiously, before a series of uncharacteristic mistakes allowed the Spaniard back in, with the inflection point arriving as Djokovic fell, hurt his shoulder, and lost his serve to end up 5-6 down in the opening set.
Lashing out in frustration, Djokovic took a ball out of his pocket and thrashed it behind him, which ended up hitting a line judge on her neck. Realising his inadvertent blow, a remorseful Djokovic promptly checked up on his unsuspecting victim. Fortunately for the woman, no major damage was done. Unfortunately for Djokovic, it was damage enough. Deemed to have violated the grand slam rulebook for “negligent disregard”, Djokovic was disqualified. A peeved Novak left Flushing Meadows without speaking to the press and then put up a carefully worded apology online.
A part of me felt mildly sympathetic for Djokovic, but the bigger part saw this as another faux pas for the hugely gifted Serb. An apparent anti-vaxxer, an organiser of a tennis junket without social distancing, a pioneer of a men-only association for leveraging players’ interests, and now, a disqualified top seed at a grand slam where he was the firm favourite to win. Just another event in the scandal-happy life of the Djoker.
As Novak contemplates what might have been in New York, here are 10 other instances from the world of sport featuring similarly ludicrous ways of leaving the stage. AN INFAMOUS McEN-ROW
Before Novak Djokovic was polarising tennis fans, there was John McEnroe. In his most (in)famous outburst, the mercurial American was disqualified for a hat-trick of offences during the fourth round of the 1990 Australian Open. In the dead heat of his match against Mikael Pernfors, McEnroe received his first code violation for intimidating a lineswoman (by giving her a close, cold stare while juggling balls), which was swiftly followed by another when he threw his racket in anger. Then, in typical McEnroe fashion, the volatile southpaw confronted the umpire and the match referee, hurling swear words at them.
The result was a foregone conclusion, with McEnroe punished with elimination via a default.

THE “BITE FIGHT”
In this blockbuster summer showdown from 1997, Mike Tyson squared off against fellow heavyweight Evander Holyfield for the world championship in Las Vegas. Desperate for revenge, a reckless and bloodied Tyson, while locked in a clinch, bit off an inch of cartilage from Holyfield’s right ear, leading the latter to jump out in agony. Curiously, the fight still went on, with Tyson wasting little time to stick his teeth into Holyfield’s other ear, at which point the brutal affair was stopped, with Tyson finally getting disqualified. Subsequently, the self-proclaimed baddest man on the planet was fined 3 million USD and had his boxing license temporarily revoked.

ON THE WRONG TRACK
Field running has to be among the least complicated sports on the planet. Dash off, follow your track, and reach the finish line. Fairly simple, right? Not quite, at least not for the five world-class athletes running in the 400-metre heats at the 2019 IAAF World Indoor Championships. After one runner (Bralon Taplin) had committed a false start, the remaining four, including previous year’s silver medallist Abdalelah Haroun, were all disqualified for lane violations. Thus, none of the runners starting the race managed to finish it, as for the first time in the history of world championship races the entire field had been DQ-ed. RONALDO HITS A ROCKET, THEN SEES RED
Cristiano Ronaldo had scored within moments of coming on as a substitute in the first leg of the 2017 Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona. A missile of a shot that nestled into the top corner had put Real Madrid in a commanding position. But CR7 hadn’t made his point yet. Following his goal, Ronaldo took off his shirt and held it aloft in front of the Barca fans, mock-copying Lionel Messi’s celebration from a few months ago on Real’s home turf. Inevitably, Ronaldo got a yellow card for his theatrics, only to pick up another minutes later when the Portuguese was alleged to have dived in search of a penalty. Red-faced and red-carded, it was quite the cameo from Cristiano.

SHOAIB AKHTAR PICKS UP THE BAT
During a dressing room disagreement at the inaugural edition of the World T20 in South Africa, sparks began to fly between Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akhtar. Incensed by Afridi’s verbal abuse, Akhtar, bat in hand, charged towards Afridi and took a swipe with the willow. The fiery fast bowler was immediately banned from the competition and sent home, and later apologised for his conduct. Afridi, though, had escaped unscathed, as the bat swung by Akhtar had missed its target by landing on the thighs of teammate Mohammad Asif instead!

TWIN TROUBLE
Twin sisters Madeline and Margaret de Jesús were both present for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Only one, however, in Madeline had qualified to compete, for the long jump and the 4x400-metre relay. But Madeline had injured herself in the long jump event, jeopardising her participation in the relay. Step up, Margaret, who casually filled in for her twin sister, helping Puerto Rico to the finals, undetected. Well, almost. An eagle-eyed journalist had sensed something fishy after noticing a “birthmark” distinguishing the twins. The sisters were duly banned. Madeline, though, was back for the long jump at the Olympics four years later, or was it Margaret? PLAYING TO LOSE
The 2012 London Olympics witnessed a gross betrayal of sportsmanship when eight badminton players — from China, South Korea, and Indonesia — attempted to lose their games in a bid to face easier opponents in the upcoming rounds. Serving into the net on purpose and competing at a pedestrian pace without exerting themselves, the players were greeted by a chorus of jeers from the audience, before the Badminton World Federation disqualified them all on grounds of demeaning the sport.

HAND-IN-HAND IN GUILT
Britain’s Jessica Learmonth and Georgia Taylor-Brown had placed first and second, respectively, at the 2019 World Triathlon Olympic Qualifier in Tokyo. And then, they hadn’t. Just before crossing the finish line, out of mutual solidarity in the midst of a searing heatwave, both Jessica and Georgia had clasped hands and ended the race with their palms locked in embrace. Rule 2.11.f of the International Triathlon Union wasn’t warmed by the gesture, as both athletes were disqualified for trying to contrive a tied finish.
PUTTING ON A SHOW
With Brazil leading 1-0 and Chile needing to win at the Maracana in 1989 to make it to the next World Cup, Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas collapsed to the floor, bleeding, in the 67th minute, complaining of getting hurt by a flare thrown by Brazilian fans. With Rojas’s end of the goal clouded in smoke, the Chilean team left the pitch in protest as the officials pondered over awarding Chile a victory by disqualifying the home team. But the next day completely altered the complexion of the game with numerous pictures from media outlets definitively showing that the flare in question had landed well away from Rojas and could not have hit him. How, then, had Rojas managed to bleed? In a sensational confession, Rojas admitted to having cut himself with a blade (concealed in his goalkeeping glove!) as part of a strategy by Chile to have the contest nullified. To nobody’s surprise, Chile were forbidden from participating in the 1990 World Cup and Rojas was banned “in perpetuity”.",sports
Team shares Lewis blame," Formula One leader Lewis Hamilton should not have blamed himself for an error that denied him a 90th career victory at Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix, Mercedes said on Wednesday.
The six-time world champion entered a closed pitlane at Monza after Kevin Magnussen’s Haas was stranded nearby, a mistake that changed the race.
Hamilton, who had led from pole, finished seventh after a penalty dropped him to last and AlphaTauri’s French driver Pierre Gasly took a shock win instead.
The Briton told reporters he had not seen electronic warning boards but Mercedes said that was to be expected.
Trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said Hamilton, who leads teammate Valtteri Bottas by 47 points after eight races, had not been best placed to spot something that should have been picked up by the team.

“The team takes responsibility for it. We’ll put systems in place to make sure we don’t do this again,” said Shovlin. “He (Hamilton) will always want to improve and to put it right himself and that was probably why he took the blame for this but really we need to put it on our shoulders.”
James Vowles, strategy director at Mercedes, said the closed pitlane message came 11 seconds after the safety car was deployed. Hamilton, comfortably ahead, entered the pitlane 10 seconds later.
Vowles said the key message was not noticed by the team, who had only seconds to react, until it was too late.
“We can hear from other team radio that it took them about 10 seconds to notice it as well,” said Vowles. “And that 10 seconds was the crucial period where because Lewis was so far in the lead of the race he was just able to come in.”
He said Mercedes would make software changes to ensure critical messages were seen faster.",sports
Serena rallies to halt Pironkova," Serena Williams was forced to dig deep to secure a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 US Open quarter final victory over unseeded Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova on Wednesday, keeping alive her latest bid for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title.
Serena, a six-time champion in New York, struggled with Pironkova’s slice forehand early and was at risk of her earliest US Open exit in 14 years until she used her experience to find a way back.
For Pironkova, who dropped to 0-5 in career head-to-head meetings with Serena, the loss marked the end of a surprise New York run, given this was her first professional tournament since Wimbledon in 2017.
On Tuesday, Naomi Osaka’s sharp serving and superior return game helped her past American Shelby Rogers 6-3, 6-4 and into the semi-finals as the Japanese continues her quest for a second title at Flushing Meadows.
Osaka, who was 0-3 lifetime against Rogers coming into the match, broke at love to take a 5-3 lead in the first set where Rogers hit 16 unforced errors to Osaka’s five and held serve to claim the set.

The fourth seeded Osaka broke again early in the second set for a 2-1 lead and sealed the win when Rogers dumped a forehand into the net on match point for her 28th unforced error.
“Honestly, I felt like she had the upper hand because I’d never beaten her and those memories are stuck in my head,” said the 22-year-old Osaka, who last faced Rogers in 2017.
“So, yeah, I consider this a little bit of revenge.”
Osaka once again had tape wrapped around her left thigh but said it was just as a precaution. Next up for Osaka is in-form American Jennifer Brady, who beat Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva in 6-3, 6-2 earlier in the day.
The 28th-seeded Brady, who has yet to drop a set at this year’s US Open, used her massive forehand and impressive court coverage to deny Putintseva in her bid to become the first Kazakh woman to reach the final four of any major.
German fifth seed Alexander Zverev survived a stern test of nerve to reach his second Grand Slam semi-final this year with a 1-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(1), 6-3 victory over Croatian Borna Coric.
After a slow start, Zverev raised his game and showed more poise in the crucial moments against the 27th seed to become the first German to reach the last four at the US Open since Boris Becker in 1995.
“I just started playing maybe a little bit more aggressive because if I would’ve played the way I played (at the start), it’s not the level for a quarter-final match at a Grand Slam,” said Zverev.
Pablo Carreno Busta outlasted an erratic Denis Shapovalov 3-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(4), 0-6, 6-3 in a seesaw battle lasting over four hours to advance to his second US Open semi-final.
The 29-year-old Spaniard, the oldest of the men’s quarter finalists at Flushing Meadows, looked to be heading for his first loss on hardcourts to his Canadian opponent after Shapovalov served him a bagel in the fourth set.
However, after getting some treatment to his lower back, 2017 semi-finalist Carreno Busta fought back gamely to seal the deciding set.
After spending just an hour on court in his previous round when world No. 1 Novak Djokovic was disqualified, Carreno Busta was understandably drained.
“I’m destroyed, but you know I’m very, very happy,” he said in his on-court interview.
“After this fight, this battle, it’s hard to say, but it is incredible to be back in the semi-finals again.”",sports
"Pool ace, now taller, ready to make a splash"," Srihari Nataraj knows how to swim against the current. And that is why the ace India swimmer claims to have emerged a better person from the lockdown, which otherwise has turned the world topsy-turvy, certainly for most athletes who were robbed of practice while locked up at home.
Speaking from Dubai, where he is training along with Kushagra Rawat and Sajan Prakash, Srihari, 19, told The Telegraph: “Look, when the lockdown started, I told myself that there’s no point fretting and worrying. Instead, let me make the most of this time. And I did!
“I’ve never had a five-month break in my career and this was my first vacation in a decade.
“I put my feet up, watched movies all the time, slept a lot, learnt how to play the guitar and did sundry other things which I wanted to but never had the time for.
“The last season,” continued Srihari, “was very tiring and today, after the break, I am refreshed and a completely different person.

“We, the swimmers, have been requesting the government to open the pools. But the government must have had its reason to hold on to the permission. So, I saw no point in cribbing,” he added.
How is the training in Dubai, organised by the Sports Authority of India and Swimming Federation of India, going?
“The training is going well and am happy to be back where I belong — in the pool. I am gradually getting back to my peak. Here my hours of practice are the same as they were at home in Bangalore, two hours in the morning and two in the evening.
“The pool’s good… Not much can be different in this sport, can it be — a pool’s a pool,” he laughs.
The past five months, the backstroke specialist has been using the gym equipment he has at home to keep himself fit.
As for what the next step is after the two months in Dubai, Srihari is unsure. “We are trying to work things out but, as of now, cannot give you a definite plan.”
Srihari has breached the B qualification mark for the Olympics in the 100m backstroke and intends to achieve the A standard.
“For which I, naturally, have to swim faster,” he grins. “I am 19 now and in five months my physique has changed, I have grown a little taller. I’ll know exactly where I stand after I take part in a race or two.”
Srihari will have to achieve the A mark in a Fina accredited tournament, but he doesn’t know which one yet because no one is sure of the calendar right now. Till then, he knows what to do. Swim.",sports
Brady races into semis," American Jennifer Brady continued her surprise surge at the US Open with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva on Tuesday to reach her first Grand Slam semi-final.
The 28th-seeded Brady used her massive forehand and impressive court coverage to deny Putintseva in her bid to become the first Kazakh woman to reach the final four of any major.
On Monday, Sofia Kenin said she was already done crying over her one-sided loss to Elise Mertens in the fourth round and the second seed will instead focus on the positives.
Australian Open champion Kenin, 21, had not dropped a set, won 26 of her 28 service games and was the highest surviving seed at Flushing Meadows coming into Monday’s match. But an error prone performance from Kenin meant the 16th-seeded Mertens barely felt any pressure during a 6-3, 6-3 win
Victoria Azarenka had a huge smile on her face after reaching her first Grand Slam quarter final in more than four years by beating Czech Karolina Muchova 5-7, 6-1, 6-4. The former world No. 1 had to rally from a set down to set up a last eight date with Mertens.

Unseeded Tsvetana Pironkova has not seen her son in two weeks and the tearful Bulgarian dedicated her astonishing run to her two-year-old after she advanced to her first ever quarter final in New York. On Monday, Pironkova battled past France’s Alize Cornet 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-3 and then choked back tears while talking about her son Alexander.
Among men, second seed Dominic Thiem edged a first-set tie-break before turning up the heat to romp into the quarter finals with a 7-6(4), 6-1, 6-1 victory over Canadian youngster Felix Augur-Aliassime.
 Daniil Medvedev stormed into the quarter finals with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 win over a listless Frances Tiafoe. The Indian challenge came to an end with the loss of Rohan Bopanna and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov in the men’s doubles quarter finals event here.

Novak urges compassion for line judge," Novak Djokovic has pleaded for compassion for the line judge he inadvertently struck in the throat with a ball at the US Open on Monday after the female official faced a backlash from fans of the world No. 1 on social media.
The Serb was disqualified in the fourth round after he hit a ball to the back of the court in frustration after dropping serve in the first set against Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta, sending the official to the floor.
A section of Djokovic’s fans took to social media to hurl abuse at the official after her Instagram username was carried by Serbian media.
“Shame on you. Old lady full of evil,” read one of the messages left on her Instagram account, while other users accused her of faking the injury and “bad acting”.
Djokovic on Tuesday defended the official on Twitter, while thanking fans who had left him positive messages of support.
“Please also remember the linesperson that was hit by the ball last night needs our community’s support too. She’s done nothing wrong at all. I ask you to stay especially supportive and caring to her during this time.
“From these moments, we grow stronger and we rise above. Sharing love with everyone. Europe here I come.”
With the line judge screaming out in pain as she fell to the ground, a horrified Djokovic ran over to her and apologised.
A tournament spokesman said later that the line judge appeared to be okay and was not brought off-site.
Tournament referee Soeren Friemel came out on to the Arthur Ashe Stadium and spoke to chair umpire Aurelie Tourte and Andreas Egli, the Grand Slam supervisor, before a long chat with the three-time former US Open winner.
Djokovic pleaded his case for 12 minutes but the Grand Slam rules are clear, and his fate was already sealed.
Britain’s Tim Henman, who suffered a similar fate in 1995 at Wimbledon, said Djokovic would learn from the experience.
“Djokovic has had plenty of examples in the past where he has cut it pretty fine on the court,” Henman told The Times. “Unfortunately for him he has got it wrong this time and suffered the harshest penalty. I think he will take this on board because he is a bright individual.”                 ",sports
Messi and FC Barcelona have come to share a toxic dynamic," Break-ups can be ugly, acrimonious, devastating. But worse still is a relationship that is so fundamentally flawed, so irreparably broken, that the ones in it cannot even agree upon a way out. After two decades, some unforgettable football, and 33 trophies, this is precisely the kind of relationship that Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona have come to share — a toxic dynamic that continues simply because it cannot let go, even if it wants to.
Going… going… not gone
On August 25, the unthinkable happened. Messi sent a burofax (the latest buzzword for a legal notice) to Barcelona stating his desire to terminate his contract and leave for free. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City seemed in pole position to snap up the six-time Ballon d’Or once Barcelona had accepted Messi’s wish, which, of course, they did not.
In fact, Barcelona replied to Messi’s transfer request by stating their own interpretation of Messi’s complicated contract, declaring that Messi could only leave once City or any prospective buyer had paid Barcelona the barely imaginable sum of 700 million euros. The clause for the payment of this fee was deemed to have expired according to the Messi camp, but not according to Barcelona and their beleaguered president Josep Bartomeu.
What followed was utter pandemonium. Thousands of Barcelona fans, pandemic notwithstanding, marched into the Camp Nou premises protesting against Bartomeu and his board. A mural popped up in the Catalan capital depicting Messi as a Che Guevara-esque rebel with the words, “Hasta Siempre, Comandante” (until forever, commander). For those who believed that Messi’s move was a cleverly timed act of power play to force Bartomeu to resign, a sporting revolution was underway. Former Barcelona player and ex-captain Carles Puyol expressed support for Messi’s choice to leave, as Man City tried to do the math to negotiate the biggest switch in football history. Messi did not show up for training under new manager Ronald Koeman, while Jorge Messi, Leo’s father and agent, travelled all the way from Rosario to Barcelona for talks with Bartomeu.
By the first couple of days of September, it was evident that Messi was not trying to engineer a coup. He wanted to leave for good. Having joined Barcelona’s youth academy as a 13-year-old prodigy, Messi, now 33, had never played for any other professional club. But all that was about to change, a Messi-less future had nearly dawned in Catalonia.
And then, on September 4, it all began to unravel. In a volte-face that would have pleased the best absurdist playwright, Messi gave an interview to goal.com, whose definitive purpose was to communicate that he would stay.
The reason: Bartomeu would not let him leave without the 700 million euros payment, and Messi had no intention to drag Barcelona to court. The only way out of the stalemate was for the club’s greatest player to give in to the club’s most scandalous president. From the nouveau riche clutches of Man City, Barcelona had managed to retain the services of Messi.
The end of modern football’s weirdest transfer saga, but not the end of modern football’s most topsy-turvy love story.
Delaying the inevitable
Even before the sheer ludicrousness of recent events, the cracks had begun to appear between Messi and Barcelona. Three gut-wrenching exits from the Champions League in three years — the latest of which came in the form of an 8-2 hammering by Bayern Munich in the middle of August — had proven beyond doubt that Barcelona not only had a on-field crisis, they had an institutional one, too.
Shoddy business in the transfer market, a scattergun approach towards managerial appointments, and above all, an inexcusable complacency towards Messi, assuming that he would never leave, ensured that conditions were ripe for Messi to do just that, leave, and “look for a new challenge elsewhere”. Even if that meant, by Messi’s own admission, “a brutal drama” at home, with his wife and three children reluctant to shift.
It is not as if Messi had not tried his utmost to keep Barcelona competitive. But since the departure of Neymar in 2017, there had simply been too much for him to do, as both creator and goalscorer-in-chief. With their rich philosophy crumbling with every mistimed run, every stray pass, and every defensive debacle, the Barca way had become very similar to the Argentina way — give the ball to Messi, and hope. Just like for the Albiceleste, and despite Messi’s genius, such a plan was never going to produce sustained results.
To add to his weight of carrying the Barcelona team on his shoulders, Messi had to tackle the steadily growing narrative that he was the ultimate puppet master at the club, that his friendships with players defined transfer policy, that his entourage put the club under commercial strains, and that in an era where the whole has never been greater than the sum of its parts across Europe’s elite teams, Messi had become bigger than Barcelona.
The truth, as it turns out, is not that Messi is some diminutive dictator at Barcelona, but that for all his talent and clout, he is only as powerful as the Barcelona board want him to be.
Having said that, in keeping him against his wishes for at least one more year, Bartomeu and Co. have probably just delayed the inevitable — the arrival of the day when the best player in the world is no longer at Barcelona.
The two roads from here
As both a Barca and Messi fan, the last few weeks have been my worst nightmare. To imagine Messi in different colours was painful enough, but to know that he would be leaving Barcelona after playing his last match in front of an empty stadium and on the receiving end of the club’s heaviest defeat since 1946, was straight out of the fiercest depths of footballing hell.
And yet, the news of him staying is no cause for celebration, at least not yet.
There are two ways things can go from here. The first, and the more likely scenario, being that Messi wanders in and out of matches next season as part of a transitional team that is trying to exorcise the failures of past campaigns. Barcelona arrest their decline but do not offer the “winning project” that Messi desperately wants. Come next summer, Messi leaves, most plausibly for Man City, while Barcelona finally flip the first page of the post-Messi era.
The second scenario being that Koeman works a few instant miracles, and out of nowhere, Barcelona are transformed, reawakened as a continental giant. Messi pretends, like Barcelona’s official website, that he never intended to leave, and extends his stay indefinitely. Bartomeu is replaced by a new and more principled president (elections are due in March 2021), and everything is hunky-dory once more.
Of course, neither of these scenarios will materialise instantly. The next few months, possibly the rest of 2020, will unfold with questions hovering like ballistic drones — does Messi still care (even if he says he does), how will the fans react, will the rest of the squad get along with their captain?
Amidst these queries, there are bound to be moments when Barcelona struggle, when Messi shrugs his shoulders and looks to the heavens, reaffirming that Barcelona ought to have learnt how to let go.
But such is the nature of football that alongside these bits of despair, there is also the certainty of fresh, if only temporary, hope. The certainty of Messi dropping his shoulder, playing a one-two, deceiving a defender (or two or three) and curling the ball into the top corner of the net, celebrating once more in the shirt of the Blaugrana. Producing moments when, against both reason and recent history, we are led to believe that Messi and Barcelona are still made for each other.",sports
Serena Williams books US Open quarters berth," Serena Williams booked a place in the quarter-finals of the US Open on Monday with a hard-fought, three-set win over 15th seed Maria Sakkari. Serena required two hours and 28 minutes to defeat the 25-year-old Greek player 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3.
Earlier, Australian Alex de Minaur tamed Canada’s Vasek Pospisil 7-6(6), 6-3, 6-2 to ease into his first Grand Slam quarter final.

"Djokovic: reckless & needless, a double ‘fault’"," Novak Djokovic’s default from the US Open after hitting a line judge in the neck with a ball that he struck toward the back of the court in frustration is perhaps the most costly one in tennis history.
It fell under the Grand Slam rule book’s definition of “physical abuse,” which states that players “shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site.”
The rules subject a player to a fine of up to $20,000 for each violation of this rule, with the possibility of escalation if it is deemed a “major offence.”
“In circumstances that are flagrant and particularly injurious to the success of a tournament, or are singularly egregious, a single violation of this section shall also constitute the major offence of ‘Aggravated Behaviour’ and shall be subject to the additional penalties hereinafter set forth,” the rule book says.
At its harshest, “aggravated behaviour” can trigger “a fine of up to $250,000 or the amount of prize money won at the tournament, whichever is greater, and a maximum penalty of permanent suspension from play in all Grand Slam tournaments.”
Djokovic had earned exactly $250,000 for reaching the fourth round of the US Open.
In a statement, the United States Tennis Association said: “In accordance with the Grand Slam rule book, following his actions of intentionally hitting a ball dangerously or recklessly within the court or hitting a ball with negligent disregard of the consequences, the US Open tournament referee defaulted Novak Djokovic from the 2020 US Open. Because he was defaulted, Djokovic will lose all ranking points earned at the US Open and will be fined the prize money won at the tournament in addition to any or all fines levied with respect to the offending incident.”
Despite the clarity of the rules, Djokovic pleaded his case for several minutes, saying that the line judge would not need to go to a hospital. A tournament official on court responded to him that the consequences might have been different had the line judge not collapsed to the ground and stayed there for a prolonged time in clear distress.
Incidents of tennis players striking officials are rare, but not unprecedented. There were two high-profile incidents of similar defaults in men’s tennis, though none as significant as the disqualification of a top-seeded player at a Grand Slam.
With Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer not competing, and Marin Cilic and Andy Murray having lost in the first week, Djokovic’s exit leaves the tournament without any men who have previously won a Grand Slam title. There will be a first-time Grand Slam singles champion in men’s tennis for the first time since Cilic at the 2014 US Open.
Djokovic is not the first decorated champion to have a tournament end in controversy. At the 2009 US Open, Serena Williams was given a point penalty while down match point, ending the match, after threatening to shove a ball down the throat of a line judge who had called her for a foot fault.
At the 1990 Australian Open, John McEnroe was defaulted from his fourth-round match.         
New York Times News Service",sports
McEnroe: Djokovic will be the ‘bad guy’," Novak Djokovic will have to get used to being the “bad guy” following his disqualification from the US Open for striking a line judge with a ball, American great John McEnroe has said.
The world No. 1 was defaulted after a ball he swiped in frustration hit a female official in the throat on Sunday.
McEnroe, whose own behaviour frequently landed him in hot water with officials during his playing career, said Djokovic had buckled under pressure.
“The pressure just got to him. I think a lot has been going on off the court,” McEnroe told ESPN.
“It’s obviously affected him and whether he likes it or not, he’s going to be the bad guy the rest of his career.

“If he embraces that role, I think he could recover. He’s got a lot of things going for him, but this is a stain that he’s not going to be able to erase.”
After the premature end to his bid for an 18th Grand Slam, Djokovic left the grounds without attending a news conference and McEnroe, a four-time US Open champion, said the Serb should have faced the music instead of apologising on social media.
“You got to man up. It made no sense to me. In the past I’ve seen him take responsibility when he’s blown it. In this case it makes it even worse,” he said. “So what if he apologised on Twitter... that’s not good enough.”",sports
Novak out of US Open after accidentally hitting line judge," Novak Djokovic, the top men’s player in a sport with its share of meltdowns and misbehaviour, became the first No. 1 disqualified from a Grand Slam singles tournament after he inadvertently struck a line judge with a ball hit in frustration at the US Open on Sunday.
Djokovic’s sudden ouster from the country’s premier tennis tournament immediately made a bizarre US Open even more strange. It has been staged during the coronavirus pandemic, with players sparring with local health officials over contact tracing and the top women’s doubles team abruptly disqualified on Saturday. This was also the latest misadventure for Djokovic in 2020, a year in which he has expressed personal hesitation about vaccines, organised an exhibition tournament that led to coronavirus cases, including his own, and sowed division in the tennis world by forming a potential breakaway players’ organisation.
Djokovic lost his cool when trailing 5-6 in the first set in the fourth round against Pablo Carreño Busta, having lost several recent points. He had just lost a game while serving after being treated for pain in his left shoulder earlier in the game, giving Carreño Busta the upper hand.
After losing the final point of the game, he pulled a ball from his pocket and smacked it with his racket toward the back of the court. It hit a line judge, standing about 40 feet away, in her throat. She cried out and crumpled to the ground, and Djokovic rushed to her side to check on her condition.
She later walked off the court, still visibly in distress, and was treated by a tournament physician. But after a lengthy discussion with tournament referee Soeren Friemel at the net, Djokovic was defaulted, as disqualifications are known in the sport.
“This whole situation has left me really sad and empty,” Djokovic said in an Instagram post in the evening. “I checked on the linesperson and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling ok. I’m extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So unintended. So wrong.”
Djokovic continued: “I need to go back and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being. I apologize to the US Open tournament and everyone associated for my behavior.”
Djokovic’s exit delivered an immediate blow to the tournament, which was considered unlikely to take place when New York was one of the epicentres of the coronavirus. The tournament is being held without spectators for the first time and with players and their teams tested daily and restricted to their lodging and the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
Djokovic was the only member of the “Big Three” in men’s tennis to play the event this year, with Roger Federer out for the season after two knee surgeries and reigning champion Rafael Nadal choosing to remain in Spain and prepare for the rescheduled French Open and other clay-court tournaments.
Djokovic only decided to come to New York last month after lengthy negotiations with tournament officials over quarantine rules. But his default deprives the men’s event of the only player remaining who has won a Grand Slam singles title.
Djokovic has won 17 major singles titles. Men’s tour officials have been eager for a new champion to emerge to challenge the dominance of the Big Three, but this was certainly not the way anyone expected it would happen.
Some television viewers expressed puzzlement online at how a mere gesture of frustration, without intent to harm anyone, could lead to a disqualification when so many of the tournament’s historic losses of composure, like one involving Serena Williams in the 2018 US Open final, carried penalties that were less severe. Williams received a series of conduct violations — for coaching, for racket abuse and for verbal abuse of the chair umpire — and was docked a point and then a game but not defaulted.
The Grand Slam rules bar players from the abuse of balls as well as unsportsmanlike conduct, and tournament officials have the authority to disqualify a player immediately if they deem a case sufficiently serious.
Players can be defaulted for “hitting a ball or throwing a racket without intent to harm” if someone is injured on the court, said Gayle David Bradshaw, a retired ATP Tour vice-president for rules and competition. “In this case, there was no intent, but there was harm, and the officials had no choice but to do what they did,” he said.
Officials have some latitude in deciding how serious an offence might be, but Friemel said Sunday’s ruling was clear-cut. “Based on the fact that it was angrily, recklessly hit, and the line umpire was hurt clearly and in pain, he had to be defaulted.” Friemel said. “We all agree he didn’t do it on purpose, but he hit her, and she was hurt.” During a warm-up tournament for the US Open that was staged at the same site, Aljaz Bedene, a Slovenian player, inadvertently hit a cameraman with a ball that he tapped in frustration and received a warning but was not defaulted because the cameraman immediately made it clear that he had suffered no injury.
Carreño Busta, from Spain, advanced to the quarterfinals with the default. Djokovic left the stadium without speaking to news reporters.
“If it would have landed anywhere else, we’re talking about a few inches, he would have been fine,” said Alexander Zverev, who was watching inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.
In a statement, the United States Tennis Association said that because of the default Djokovic would be fined the prize money he would have earned in addition to any fines that will be levied because of the incident. He faces a fine of up to $20,000 for skipping his mandatory post-match news conference.
Djokovic, 33, has won five of the last seven Grand Slam singles titles and had dropped just one set in his first three matches at the US Open. But the first set against Carreño Busta was a tight affair. At one stage earlier in the set, he smashed a ball in frustration toward the side of the court, hitting no one.
He failed to convert three set points on Carreño Busta’s serve in the 10th game, But when serving at 5-5, Djokovic fell hard on the second point and got up wincing and grabbing at his left shoulder. He returned to the court trailing by two points and then lost the game, still looking uncomfortable with his two-handed backhand and resorting to a one-handed drop shot twice.
Miffed, he smacked another ball in frustration, then extended his left arm in apology toward the line judge as soon as he saw she had been struck. Goran Ivanisevic, Djokovic’s coach, slumped in his seat in the players box in the cavernous, nearly empty stadium, seemingly aware of the implications.

Djokovic out of US Open after hitting line judge with ball," Novak Djokovic was kicked out of the US Open for accidentally hitting a line judge in the throat with a tennis ball after dropping a game in his fourth-round match Sunday, a stunning end to his 29-match winning streak and bid for an 18th Grand Slam title.
As he walked to the Arthur Ashe Stadium sideline for a changeover, trailing Pablo Carreno Busta 6-5 in the first set, Djokovic -- who was seeded and ranked No. 1 and an overwhelming favourite for the championship -- angrily smacked a ball behind him. The ball flew right at the line judge, who dropped to her knees at the back of the court and reached for her neck.
During a discussion of about 10 minutes near the net involving chair umpire Aurelie Tourte, tournament referee Soeren Friemel and Grand Slam supervisor Andreas Egli, Djokovic appeared to be pleading his case. But eventually, he walked over to shake hands with Carreno Busta.
Tourte then announced that Djokovic was defaulted, the tennis equivalent of an ejection.
""I was a little bit in shock, no?"" Carreno Busta said later at a news conference done via video conference.
Djokovic left the tournament grounds without speaking to the media.
Asked whether Djokovic should have been allowed to continue to play, Carreno Busta shrugged and replied: ""Well, the rules are the rules.... The referee and the supervisor (did) the right thing, but it's not easy to do it.""
Indeed, the US Tennis Association issued a statement saying that Friemel defaulted Djokovic ""in accordance with the Grand Slam rulebook, following his actions of intentionally hitting a ball dangerously or recklessly within the court or hitting a ball with negligent disregard of the consequences"".
The USTA went on to say Djokovic forfeits the ranking points and USD 250,000 in prize money he earned in the tournament -- ""in addition to any or all fines levied with respect to the offending incident"".
Djokovic began the day 26-0 this season and with an unbeaten run that extended to his last three matches of 2019. He had won five of the past seven Grand Slam tournaments to raise his total to 17, closing in on rivals Roger Federer, who has a men's-record 20, and Rafael Nadal, who has 19.
With reigning US Open champion Nadal, who cited concerns about travelling amid the pandemic, and Federer, sidelined after two knee operations, not in the field, the 33-year-old Djokovic was expected to claim a fourth trophy in New York and gain on them.
But it all came apart so suddenly Sunday, even if it was clear that Djokovic did not intend to hit the line judge. He wasn't looking in her direction when his racket made contact with the ball, and there was concern written on his face as soon as he realized what happened.
But players who hit a ball out of anger and make contact with an on-court official have been defaulted in the past.
In 2017, for example, Denis Shapovalov the 21-year-old Canadian scheduled to play his fourth-round match Sunday night was defaulted from a Davis Cup match against Britain when he accidentally hit the chair umpire in the face with a ball.
At Wimbledon in 1995, Tim Henman hit a ball into the head of a ball girl and was defaulted from a doubles match.
""I think the supervisors and all them are just doing their job, but very unlucky for Novak,"" said Alexander Zverev, the No. 5-seeded man, who reached the quarterfinals by winning Sunday.
""If it would have landed anywhere else we're talking a few inches he would have been fine.""
Among the many oddities about the 2020 US Open, the first Grand Slam tournament since the outset of the pandemic, is that there are no spectators.
Another is that only the two largest arenas -- Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadium -- have full complements of line judges making calls at matches. At other courts, chair umpires are aided by an electronic line-calling system.
Djokovic's mood had soured over the preceding few minutes Sunday. In the prior game, he wasted three consecutive break points and after the last, which Carreno Busta won with a drop shot, Djokovic whacked a ball off a courtside advertising sign.
Then, on the second point of what would become the last game at this year's U.S. Open for Djokovic, he stumbled while chasing a shot and fell to the ground, clutching his left shoulder.
Play was delayed for a few minutes while a trainer checked on him.
On the second point after they resumed, Carreno Busta hit a passing winner to break Djokovic's serve. That's when Djokovic got himself into trouble.
His departure means there is no man left in the field who has won a Grand Slam singles title. Whoever emerges as champion will be the first first-time major trophy winner in men's tennis since 2014, when Marin Cilic won the US Open.
Plus, each of the last 13 Grand Slam trophies had been won by a member of the Big Three of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.
""Going to be a new Grand Slam champion, (that's) all I know. No Grand Slam champions left in the draw. Now it gets interesting,"" said Zverev, who beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-2, 6-2, 6-1. ""Now I think is the time when it gets really interesting.""",sports
Gasly wins ‘crazy race’," France’s Pierre Gasly won an astonishing Italian Grand Prix thriller for Italy-based AlphaTauri on Sunday in a topsy-turvy race packed with suspense and none of the usual top teams on the podium.
McLaren’s Spaniard Carlos Sainz finished a close second at Monza after a nail-biting chase to the flag, with Racing Point’s Lance Stroll third on a podium of youngsters.
Mercedes’s championship leader Lewis Hamilton finished seventh after starting on pole and dropping to last following a 10-second stop/go penalty for entering the pit lane under a red light while leading.
Despite the setback, the six-time world champion retained his 47-point lead at the top — now over teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was fifth, after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen retired.
It was the first time since 2013, when Kimi Raikkonen triumphed with Lotus in Australia, that a team other than Mercedes, Ferrari or Red Bull had won a race.

“It’s unbelievable,” gasped Gasly, who was dropped by Red Bull’s main team last year but has come on in strides in the strangest of seasons. “It was such a crazy race and we capitalised on it.”               ",sports
Authentic triumphs," There has been no Indian horse racing since March 13, when it was abruptly halted because of the pandemic, but the wheels of fortune keep spinning for one Gaurav Rampal, an International bloodstock consultant. Rampal’s horse, Authentic, won the richest race in the world, the Kentucky Derby, in the wee hours of Sunday.
Rampal, an Indian, is in syndicate ownership of the winner, a 8/1 shot, who literally made it a start-to-finish affair over the 2,000m Derby trip, taking an easy measure of the 6/10 hot favourite, Tiz The Law.
“The race was originally billed for May 2 and I was a non-starter from the very start because of the International travel restrictions,” said Rampal from his Mumbai residence.
“The bloodstock specialists normally don’t own horses but Authentic was an exception,” he said.
The horse was trained by Bob Baffert, his record sixth win in the Derby. The deadly combination was provided by jockey John Velazquez who also boasts of his third win in the prized event.",sports
"Mummy rises, a Serena show"," In danger of her earliest exit at the US Open since her debut 22 years ago, Serena Williams turned things around and took over against Sloane Stephens.
Serena emerged from the third-round match-up between two Americans who are past champions at Flushing Meadows — she’s won six of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles at the place — with a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over 2017 winner Stephens on Saturday.
Afterward, Serena’s three-year-old daughter, Olympia, wore a mask and waved at mom while sitting on her father’s lap in a front-row seat. On her way to the locker room, Serena waved back. “I hope,” Serena said, “that she saw her mama fighting.”
Serena did it, as she so often does, with her best-in-the-game serve, hitting 12 aces at up to 122 mph, and an ability to re-calibrate her groundstrokes that were so awry early and so superb down the stretch.
 “She served a lot better,” said Stephens, now 1-6 against Serena, although they hadn’t played each other since 2015.

“Obviously she has one of the greatest serves in the game. It’s really difficult to read.”
Serena collected 10 of the last 12 games by lifting her level, to be sure. But it helped that Stephens went from playing nearly perfectly to missing more and more.
Following mistakes, Stephens would look over at her coach, Kamau Murray, or smack her right thigh with her palm so loudly that it echoed through a nearly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium.
“In that first set, I don’t think she made any errors, honestly. She was playing so clean. I said, ‘I don’t want to lose in straight sets’,” said Serena, whose only career US Open loss before the fourth round came in the third against Irina Spirlea in 1998 at age 16.  Serena, who turns 39 in three weeks, said she told herself Saturday: “OK, Serena, just get a game. Get a game.”
Asked Saturday what the positives are about still being active on tour as a parent, Serena said: “One day, your daughter can say she was there. Whether she remembers or not, we can always have pictures. But other than that, it’s just (a) minus, like: I’m not with her, ‘'m not around her. It’s hard.”
Serena has reached the finals at four of the past seven major tournaments, losing each time. She is four wins from adding to her Grand Slam trophy count, which has been at 23 since she won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant.
Serena next faces 15th seeded Maria Sakkari.
Second seed Sofia Kenin overcame a sluggish start to surge past Tunisian Ons Jabeur 7-6 (4), 6-3 on Saturday and move into the fourth round of the US Open for the first time.
In Sunday’s matches, Jennifer Brady produced a fearless brand of tennis to topple 2016 champion Angelique Kerber 6-1, 6-4 and reach the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the first time.
In men’s action, 2019 runner-up Daniil Medvedev and another semi-finalist from a year ago, No. 6 Matteo Berrettini moved on, as did No. 10 Andrey Rublev, No. 15 Felix Auger-Aliassime, No. 21 Alex de Minaur and Vasek Pospisil.
Pospisil eliminated No. 8 Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and next face another five-set winner, De Minaur, who defeated No. 11 Karen Khachanov 6-4, 0-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1.
Second seed Dominic Thiem staved off a spirited fightback from Marin Cilic to beat the former champion 6-2, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 and reach the fourth round. India veteran Rohan Bopanna and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov stunned sixth seeds Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies in a hard-fought three-setter to advance to the quarter finals of the US Open men's doubles event here.

IPL schedule out: Mumbai take on Chennai on September 19," Ending days of anxious wait, the BCCI on Sunday released the schedule for the upcoming IPL, and in keeping with tradition, defending champions Mumbai Indians will take on runners-up Chennai Super Kings in the opener in Abu Dhabi on September 19.

Moved out of India due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the upcoming edition of the world's biggest T20 league will be held in the three venues of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the UAE.

After the tournament-opener, Dubai will host its first game the next day when Delhi Capitals take on Kings XI Punjab followed by the third match on Monday between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore.

The action will then shift to Sharjah on September 22 when Rajasthan Royals will host Chennai Super Kings.

There will be 10 double headers, with the first match starting at 3:30pm IST and the second 7:30pm, according to the BCCI release.

In all, 24 matches will be held in Dubai, 20 in Abu Dhabi and 12 in Sharjah.

Venues for the playoffs and the IPL 2020 final will be announced later.
The final is slated for November 10.
The IPL operations team, which is currently in Dubai, took time to finalise the schedule because of different quarantine rules in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The schedule was finalised after the Abu Dhabi government changed its quarantine rules for visitors allowing them to enter the emirate within 48 hours of a negative Covid-19 test.
That Chennai Super Kings players have passed the additional two tests during their extended quarantine period also helped in finalising the schedule.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s men have already started practice.",sports
"Tsitsipas loses way, Naomi Osaka survives a scare in US Open"," Russian Daniil Medvedev rolled through the US Open third round by demolishing American J.J. Wolf 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 on Saturday. The third seed seized the early momentum, breaking Wolf’s serve for a 3-2 lead in the first set in which he committed just two unforced errors in a show of near-flawless play.
Maria Sakkari reached the fourth round at her second consecutive Grand Slam tournament after needing just 55 minutes to eliminate mistake-prone American teen Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 6-1. The 22nd-seeded Anisimova finished with 28 unforced errors and just four winners. Sakkari made eight errors.
On Friday, Croatian Borna Coric saved six match points as he rallied from 1-5 down in the fourth set to stun Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4-7) and send the fourth seed tumbling out of the US Open in the third round.
In the sort of late drama that would on any other year have had the Flushing Meadows crowd baying for more, Coric staged a remarkable comeback at an empty Louis Armstrong Stadium to reach the fourth round after the fifth set tie-break.
 The gritty 27th seed had looked down for the count when Tsitsipas twice served for the match in the fourth set but the 22-year-old Greek faltered with victory in his grasp.

 Coric again had to come from a break down in the fifth but looked indefatigable even after 4 1/2 hours on court and secured a famous victory on his second match point.
Top seed Novak Djokovic continued his dominance of Jan-Lennard Struff with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win to advance to the fourth round.
Djokovic was never really pushed by the German, who has taken just one set off the Serb in their five career meetings. The only drama came early on when Struff had break point opportunities but could not convert against Djokovic’s serve in the first game.
The players stayed on serve until Struff sent a forehand wide on break point to give Djokovic a 5-3 lead. The Serb held to love the next game after firing an unreturnable serve to take the first set and coasted the rest of the way.
Seventh seed David Goffin was made to work hard by Serbian Filip Krajinovic before clinching a 6-1, 7-6 (5), 6-4 win, moving into the fourth round for the fourth consecutive year at Flushing Meadows.
Alexander Zverev secured a 6-7(4-7), 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 win over Adrian Mannarino in a match delayed almost three hours due to Covid-19 protocols.
Former champion Naomi Osaka survived a third round scare before grinding out a 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2 victory over Ukrainian teenager Marta Kostyuk to reach the last 16.
The Japanese fourth seed was forced to dig deep to secure victory after two hours and 33 minutes against an 18-year-old making her US Open main draw debut.
 The two-time Grand Slam champion Osaka said her left leg, which was heavily taped following the hamstring injury that forced her to withdraw from the final of a tune-up event last week, was still not 100%. India’s Rohan Bopanna and his Canadian partner Denis Shapovalov advanced to the second round of men’s doubles event after a 6-2, 6-4 win over  Ernesto Escobedo and Noah Rubin. The Indo-Canadian pair will next play sixth seeds Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies.",sports
Band of mothers marches ahead," Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka and Tsvetana Pironkova made up a ‘Band of Mothers’ who marched into the third round of the US Open on Thursday.
Serena, Azarenka and Pironkova were among the nine mothers who started in the singles competition. Six of them —Kim Clijsters, Vera Zvonareva, Tatjana Maria, Kateryna Bondarenko, Patricia Maria Tig and Olga Govortsova — have already been ousted.
But unranked Bulgarian Pironkova — playing her first tournament in three years after a break to have her first child — prolonged her participation with a 7-5, 6-3 upset of Spanish 10th seed Garbine Muguruza.
Former world No.1 Serena Williams also advanced late on Thursday with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Russia's Margarita Gasparyan.
Serena and Pironkova were later joined by Azarenka, another former world No. 1 who beat Belarussian compatriot and fifth seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-1, 6-3.
Pironkova, who gave birth to her son Alexander in April 2018, says motherhood has given her a new perspective to her tennis career. “Your priorities have nothing to do with what they were before,” she said. “Having the opportunity for him to watch me also makes me really happy. I don’t know how to explain it.
“It’s  just great to be playing without that extra pressure that I had on myself before. Before it was almost a life-and-death situation for me to win a match. Right now it’s not really like that. It’s just enjoyment to be on the court.”
Pironkova believes successfully combining motherhood with the life of an elite tennis player requires planning and motivation.
Only three women — Belgium’s Clijsters and Australians Evonne Goolagong and Margaret Court — have won Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era after having children.
Azarenka, meanwhile, said she hoped she could inspire working parents everywhere.“Pretty incredible, right?” she said, when asked to comment on the nine mothers who started the tournament.
“Everybody has their own priority, they have their own list... but it’s not just being a mother. Your life doesn’t stop.”                                                 ",sports
Murray return run ends," Germany’s Angelique Kerber advanced to the last 16 of the US Open with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 20-year-old American Ann Li at the Louis Armstrong Stadium on Friday. Kerber, a three-time Grand Slam champion who won the title at Flushing Meadows in 2016, converted four break points while Li — who is ranked 128 in the world — was let down by 28 unforced errors.
In another match, Croatian eighth seed Petra Martic survived another sloppy display to see off Grand Slam newcomer Varvara Gracheva 6-3, 6-3 and reach the US Open round of 16 for the second consecutive year.
On Thursday, Serena Williams battled her way through to a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan in the second round, as she continued her bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title.
She next faces fellow American Sloane Stephens in the third round. Serena said Stephens, who won the tournament in 2017, is “a great competitor.”
Stephens beat Olga Govortsova 6-2, 6-2. Victoria Azarenka put fellow Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka firmly in her place with an 6-1, 6-3 victory in the second round further cementing her status as a dangerous floater.American Madison Keys once again wasted no time on court at Flushing Meadows, defeating Spain’s Aliona Bolsova 6-2, 6-1 in less than an hour.
Sorana Cirstea rallied from a set down to upset ninth-seeded Briton Johanna Konta 2-6, 7-6(5), 6-4.         
Among men, Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime proved too strong for former champion Andy Murray, cutting short the Briton’s Grand Slam comeback at the US Open with a breezy 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 victory in the second round on Thursday. Before the start of the match, the 20-year-old Auger-Aliassime had said he would look to be aggressive against his three-time Grand Slam winning opponent.
 The Canadian lived up to his promise and went on the offensive from the start, dominating rallies from the baseline and making the 2012 US Open champion, who has twice had hip surgery, move all around the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.
 Auger-Aliassime did not face a single breakpoint on his serve, hit 24 aces and an incredible 52 winners compared to the nine managed by the Scot, who was playing his first Grand Slam since the 2019 Australian Open.
India’s Sumit Nagal’s trademark fighting spirit was on display throughout but it was not enough to get past world No. 3 Dominic Thiem in the second round. Nagal lost 3-6, 3-6, 2-6 to the second-seeded Austrian, who celebrated his 27th birthday with a commanding performance at the Arthur Ashe stadium on Thursday.
Thiem had said that he has seen videos of Nagal’s game and knew that he has a ripping forehand. Well prepared, he came out with a clear strategy of not giving many balls on the forehand side of the Indian.
 “Thank you 2020 US Open. Lots to learn. Going to keep working hard! Thanks for all the support everyone,” Nagal later tweeted. Third seed Daniil Medvedev motored into the third round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win over Australia’s Christopher O’Connell.",sports
Naresh Kumar on his Dronacharya Award," Every time we have stepped out of 9/1 Middleton Street after a chat with Naresh Kumar, he has set the bar high for the standards for men in our lives. Impeccable manners and immense warmth, a combination so rare. We missed meeting the 91-year-old young man this time though after his Dronacharya Award — 2020 (Tennis-Lifetime) nomination, struck by the pandemic as we are. The ever gracious Kumar who has a record number of 101 matches at Wimbledon as an amateur, was India’s Davis Cup captain and a tennis brain that many pick, answered some of our questions on email. Thank you, Sir!

Many congratulations for the Dronacharya award. How did you react to the nomination?
I was full of joy at my nomination. It is a great honour to be selected for this award.

Who called you first after the nominations were announced?
Leander (Paes) was the first person to phone me after the announcement.

It is a remarkable feat considering no tennis coach had got a Dronacharya before this. What will be the celebrations like?
During these Covid times we will celebrate with the family at home.

You have been a great mentor. Who have been your gurus in life and tennis?
My guru in tennis and life was S.J. Mathews, my coach, who imposed spartan discipline on all his pupils. I recall his words when I was leaving to play Wimbledon: ‘If you get a bad call on your tour abroad, I don’t want you to even look at the umpire but to just keep playing’. This paid me rich dividends.

In hindsight, what was more satisfying for you ... winning a title or seeing a ward win one?

Both were equally satisfying and joyous.

What have you told all your students throughout these years... what should they give to tennis and what should their approach be?
I feel that discipline is the most important part of the game.

Who has been your favourite student?
Leander.

What makes him such a keen student of the game?
His attitude towards tennis and life. I have said it many a times that I wouldn’t be what I am without Uncle Naresh. Not only was he my Davis Cup captain, not only is he one of my closest confidants, but also a guiding star. One of the best things about him is that he leads by example. As a tennis player, one of my favourite pictures of his was on the Centre Court of Wimbledon when he was playing Rod Laver. That was the year Rod Laver won the full Grand Slam. It was 5-0 and 15-0 in Uncle Naresh’s favour in the first set. I’ll never forget that picture because every athlete dreams to be at the Centre Court of Wimbledon and to play Rod Laver there and be on that court…. He has done the most amazing things in tennis, he has done the most amazing things in business, but the character of the man epitomises what a human being should be. The 360 degrees of any human being’s life, we all strive for excellence and Uncle Naresh has achieved that. He is a perfect gentleman, on and off the court. He is a perfectionist, on and off the court…. You can see the respect he gives is the respect he gets. What’s amazing about him is that he is not judgemental. Never judge a man until you walk a mile in their shoes, and Uncle Naresh is that. He reads people very, very well and that’s what I love. Another thing Uncle Naresh has instilled in me… happiness. Through tough times, put a smile on your face and find solutions, and through great times also be humble and keep achieving. The way he has led his life is an example.... All of us try to emulate him. I know I fall humbly short, but we all have heroes and idols who should have capes on their backs. “The best teachers teach from the heart and not from the book” — Sir Naresh Kumar was my first Davis Cup captain and his wisdom has been the beacon of light in my journey. A guru, a mentor and a confidante, he gave me the wings to fly and stoked my passion to play for our country. I have come a long way in 30 years yet what my Guru, Naresh Kumar taught me has stayed with me through my journey. I am fortunate to witness him getting the Lifetime Dronacharya Award for his contribution to India. #Blessed

Top seed Pliskova stunned," Tsvetana Pironkova, playing in her first event since 2017, claimed one of the shock upsets at the US Open on Thursday by dispatching double Grand Slam winner Garbine Muguruza 7-5, 6-3 to move into the third round at Flushing Meadows.
After three years away from the WTA Tour following the birth of her son Alexander, the unranked Bulgarian had 10th-seeded Muguruza smashing her racket and mumbling in frustration as the Spaniard’s US Open jinx continued to haunt her.
Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin used a mix of power and sharp angles to overwhelm Canadian Leylah Fernandez 6-4, 6-3  to reach the third round.
The second-seeded Kenin won 76% of her first-serve points and unleashed a barrage of accurate shots from the baseline that were too much to handle for Fernandez.
Up next for Kenin, who has never been past the third round in New York, will be Tunisian 27th seed Ons Jabeur, who beat Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi 7-6 (8) 6-0.

Pliskova, a former world No.1 had no answer to Garcia’s power and precision as the Frenchwoman raced out of the blocks to open up a 5-0 lead in the opening set.
 The Czech was helpless in the face of her unseeded opponent’s relentless onslaught and her exit marked the worst performance by a women’s top seed in New York since Simona Halep’s opening round defeat in 2018.
Among men, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic brushed aside Briton Kyle Edmund 6-7 (5-7) 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 after a sluggish start to remain unbeaten in 2020 and move into the third round.
On a hot, humid day at Flushing Meadows, Edmund was left bathed in sweat while a cool and collected Djokovic stayed on course for his 18th Grand Slam title and improved his 2020 match record to 25-0. “Mentally, Kyle played a fantastic first set, did not do much wrong,” said Djokovic, who celebrated his victory by moving to the centre of the court and acknowledging the canned applause.
Fifth seed Alexander Zverev fought off a spirited challenge from American wildcard Brandon Nakashima to claim a 7-5, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3, 6-1 victory in the second round.
 Zverev did not drop serve in a solid all-round display but was stretched to four sets by teenager Nakashima, ranked 223 in the world.
Stefanos Tsitsipas weathered a serve-volleying storm from Maxime Cressy before grinding the American wildcard down 7-6 (7-2), 6-3, 6-4 to reach the third round.
 In a slow-burning contest of short, sharp points, fourth seed Tsitsipas had to fight off a set point against the French-born Cressy, who fired 21 aces and rushed the net 92 times on a muggy night at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
Denis Shapovalov blew hot and cold as he was twice forced to come from behind to beat Kwon Soon-woo 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 and secure a place in the third round.
The 12th seed was in all sorts of trouble against the unheralded South Korean, losing the first set in a tie-break and going 4-2 down in the third after leveling up the contest. India’s Divij Sharan and his Serbian partner Nikola Cacic fought hard before going down in three sets to eighth seeds Nikola Mektic and Wesley Koolhof in the first round of men’s doubles. Sharan and Cacic lost 4-6, 6-3, 3-6 against Croatia’s Mektic and Koolhof of the Netherlands in a tough contest that lasted one hour and 46 minutes.",sports
Message in mother ‘tongue’," Naomi Osaka received plenty of encouragement and advice from her mother Tamaki after her second round victory at the US Open on Wednesday, although it came in the form of emojis printed on a sheet of paper.
Shortly after defeating Italian Camila Giorgi 6-1 ,6-2, 2018 champion Osaka was led to a courtside big screen to take a video call from her mother in Florida, which momentarily caught the 22-year-old off guard.
What followed was a slightly awkward exchange between mother and daughter amid audio connection issues, before Tamaki held up a sheet of paper with her message.
“I wasn’t expecting it (the call) to happen. It was a surprise. Apparently my sister told my mom to do it,” Osaka told reporters, before deciphering her mother’s message.
“There were four lines. Thumbs up fire, which is like ‘good job’. There was like a Twitter bird, whatever... And ‘I love you’.

 “... It was kind of a tech issue because normally I’m able to talk to her quite soundly. It would be kind of bad if all our conversations ended up like that. Definitely was a tech issue.” On Wednesday, Osaka stepped into the Arthur Ashe Stadium wearing a mask that read “Elijah McClain”, harnessing tennis’s global appeal in her fight for racial justice.
The 22-year-old's mask honoured McClain, the 23-year-old Black man who died after a violent encounter with Aurora, Colorado, police officers in 2019. “I think tennis — people watch it all around the world,” she said in a televised interview after her match. “Things that we think (are) common names (are) probably not common overseas.”
She had previously worn a mask honouring Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed by police officers who burst into her apartment in March, at her first-round match on Monday, and said she had seven different masks with her at the tournament.",sports
Stunning comeback by resilient Murray," “An unprecedented adventure,” was how Andy Murray’s former coach Mark Petchey — commentating on Amazon Prime — described our experience of following his career. This was another of those glorious moments, as the greatest son of British tennis came back from a two-set deficit to defeat Yoshihito Nishioka in  four hours and  38 minutes.
Murray clenched his fists and roared as he saluted his 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 victory, which he brought up with a magnificent forehand lob. It is hard to see how he will be able to drag himself back on to the court on Thursday. But never mind. This was the sort of win he must have been dreaming of when he forced himself through those endless hours of mind-numbing rehab, strengthening the muscles around his new metal hip.
After all the chat, all the build-up, his form during early stages had been highly concerning. Murray started the match with a lovely piece of artistry on the very first point. But it soon became clear he wasn’t operating at full power.
Normally, Murray’s feet are tap-tapping away all the time, ready to push him off in the appropriate direction. Even though he is one of the most fleet-footed members of the locker room — or was, anyway, when he had two organic hip joints — much of his uncanny speed stems from his almost telepathic anticipation and sheer intensity.
That intensity was completely absent here, however, as he loped around the court like a man playing a practice set. Why was Murray not fully present?

The silent stands must have played a part. But you wondered if there might not also be some anxiety in there. Playing his first Grand-Slam match for almost two years, against an opponent he knew would make him scramble across every inch of court, the sense of apprehension was palpable.
Murray dropped the first set and then lapsed into a fug of inactivity and confusion. At one point early in the second, he played the most uncharacteristically flat-footed drop shot, which dribbled into the net. Within a few minutes, he was 4-0 down — and though he fought back to make that second-set score look respectable, he was soon down a break in the third. Somehow, though, the old competitive juices began to stir. The feet slotted into position. That backhand of the ages found its mark a few times.
The moment when the real Murray arrived was perhaps the one when a Nishioka return pushed him so wide of the court that he slammed his forehand around the net rather than over it. Incredibly, Nishioka was playing so well that he still got the ball back and won the point. But from Murray’s perspective, when you start playing that sort of shot, you know your sights are back on the target.
Nothing was easy here. In order to draw level, Murray had to play two full-length sets, which he finally grasped on the tie-break with a fusillade of big serves and aggressive forehands.

Serena stays on course," Sixth seed Petra Kvitova defeated Kateryna Kozlova 7-6, 6-2 to cruise into the third round of the US Open here on Wednesday. In another early match, Angelique Kerber fought off a tough test from fellow German Anna-Lena Friedsam to win 6-3, 7-6.
Earlier on Tuesday, with no fans to cheer her on, Serena Williams was left to push herself to a record-breaking straight-sets victory in the first round.
The six-time champion won 7-5, 6-4 win over the 96th ranked Kristie Ahn.
Serena improved her first round match record to 20-0 and collected her 102nd US Open match win to surpass the mark she shared with Chris Evert.
Milos Raonic, the world No.3, advanced to the second round with a clinical 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over Leonardo Mayer.
Three-time champion Kim Clijsters fell at the first hurdle in her second comeback here when Ekaterina Alexandrova rallied for a 3-6, 7-5, 6-1 victory.
Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev faced little resistance from Federico Delbonis of Argentina in a 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 win. Former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who is living in a house with her three-year-old son and mother, breezed into the second round with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Austria’s Barbara Haas.
Karolina Muchova took advantage of an error-prone Venus Williams to advance 6-3, 7-5 into the second round.
Meanwhile, German doubles player Tim Puetz has said that the second hotel of the biosecure bubble in Long Island was hosting weddings and parties and there was no security to stop players going out if they wished. “The USTA... never communicated that we players in the second hotel were not in a bubble. The other hotel with the other 90 per cent of players is different. It is completely booked by the USTA and there is security at every entrance.”",sports
‘Bubble within a bubble’ upsets players," A number of competitors at the US Open have expressed their frustration after they were moved into a so-called “bubble within a bubble” as they had been in contact with Frenchman Benoit Paire, who tested positive for COVID-19.
 Tournament organisers quietly removed Paire from the draw on Sunday, with the Frenchman later confirming on social media that he had tested positive for Covid-19.
 French players Adrian Mannarino, Kristina Mladenovic and Edouard Roger-Vasselin were subsequently placed under an “enhanced protocol plan” for “players who might have been potentially exposed” to the virus, allowing them to continue competing in the tournament instead of withdrawing.
 However, this has meant they have been barred from using any on site player facilities. Ma nnarino, who defeated Italy’s Lorenzo Sonego 6-1, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 on Monday, said the ATP had contacted him on Saturday night to say he needed to stay in his room as a player had tested positive. On Sunday evening, he was told he would be allowed to compete but under a stricter protocol.
 “I’m wondering at the moment if I might have the virus or not,” he told reporters. “I’ve been tested every day since we had the news and I'm going to be tested every day.”
He said the experience had caused him sleepless nights and left him mentally exhausted. Mannarino added that he was relieved his close friend Paire was not experiencing any symptoms.
“We’re not 100% (sure) that (Paire) got the virus here but that’s a big probability because he's been here for a while now, he'd tested negative many times,” Mannarino said.  Mannarino said they had played cards together during their time on site and estimated Paire had contact with “probably half of the draw”.
Mladenovic complained that she now felt like she was stuck inside a “bubble within a bubble”. Those who had been in contact with Paire are being tested for Covid-19 every day rather than every four days.
 The Frenchwoman, who beat American Hailey Baptiste 7-5 6-2, said the enhanced protocols made it “very tough” to compete.
“I’m allowed to play my match, literally allowed to do nothing else. I don’t know how we’ll keep going,” she said.
“It’s mentally very tough, I still have to find a way and discuss with the USTA and organise things in order for me to be at least competitive and have equipment to keep working.”                                               ",sports
Osaka’s ‘masked’ message," Japan’s Naomi Osaka says she wants to spread awareness about racial injustice after the former US Open champion walked onto court with a mask bearing the name of Breonna Taylor on Monday.
Osaka, who moved to the US as a three-year-old, has seven separate masks with her at Flushing Meadows and hopes to wear a different one at each stage on her path to the final.
 The mask she wore in her first-round match against Misaki Doi was dedicated to Taylor, a Black woman killed by police officers who burst into her apartment in March.
 “For me, I just want to spread awareness,” the fourth seed told reporters on a video conference.
“I’m aware that tennis is watched all over the world, and maybe there is someone that doesn’t know Breonna Taylor’s story.
 “Maybe they’ll like Google it or something. I feel like the more people know the story, then the more interesting or interested they’ll become in it.” Osaka hopes she can get the chance to raise awareness about racial injustice by using each mask during her stay in New York.
“It’s quite sad that seven masks isn’t enough for the amount of names, so hopefully I’ll get to the finals so you can see all of them,” said Osaka, the champion at the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open.
The 22-year-old Osaka has been at the forefront of protests from tennis players against racial injustice in the US. She said she appreciated Open organisers putting up anti-racism artwork and ‘Black Lives Matter’ banners.
“I just feel like we’re heading towards a great direction, and there’s a lot of players that are supporting it,” she added after her 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 win over compatriot Doi.
While Osaka missed the crowd’s energy during tough moments on court, she said the empty stands helped her concentrate as her mind can wander sometimes.  “Like sometimes I will see a person with a cool outfit or something, they’re doing something, and I get distracted.”",sports
Khade takes pool break," Five months of being away from the pool has caused a change in priorities for one of India’s most accomplished swimmers, Virdhawal Khade.
The 2010 Asian Games bronze-winner opted out of a training camp in Dubai for Olympic hopefuls, making it clear that he intends to focus on his job in Maharashtra government. The 29-year-old said he will return to the sport only after pools in India reopen.
 “I am not retiring. Whenever pools open in India I will be back to training. I am still working out at home, keeping myself fit. I am happy with the fact that I can commit more time to work and family and prepare myself beyond swimming,” he said.
Swimmers in the country have not been able to enter the water since March 25, when the first coronavirus-forced lockdown was announced, forcing the national federation (SFI) to organise the two-month camp in Dubai.
Khade said he was desperate to return to training till June but began to lose motivation after that.
“I haven’t trained for five months. I went from being the fittest I have ever been in my life to absolute zero,” Khade said.
 “Five months is a long time. Until June I was really positive, I was keeping myself fit and keeping focus mentally but after that I went on a really negative spiral. I started questioning myself,” he added.  ",sports
"Nagal cruises, seeds on track"," Sumit Nagal, India’s top-ranked men’s singles player, romped into the second round of the US Open here on Tuesday, defeating American Bradley Klahn 6-1, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.
“I feel like I am playing very good tennis. I have worked a lot in the last four-five months and feel pretty good about it,” Nagal had said ahead of the match.
Ranked 124 in the ATP singles circuit, Nagal put up an impressive show and took a 2-0 lead before the American managed to win the third set. However, undaunted by that, Nagal breezed past him in the fourth set, losing only one game.
Last year, Nagal had come through the qualifiers here, but had lost to none other than Roger Federer in the first round.
Earlier, 10th seed Garbine Muguruza unleashed a seven-game surge to sweep aside Nao Hibino 6-4, 6-4.

Showing no signs of the left ankle injury that sidelined her for last week’s Western & Southern Open, Muguruza won 24 of 29 first-serve points raising her record to 17-4 this season.“I was a little bit anxious because I didn’t play in six months and I didn’t have a chance to play the US Open Series to get ready for here,” Muguruza said after the match. Novak Djokovic got his campaign to win a fourth US Open, and 18th Grand Slam title overall, off to a flying start on Monday by beating Damir Dzumhur 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 to advance to the second round.
Djokovic broke Dzumhur’s serve for a seventh time to seal the win in the first night match on Arthur Ashe Stadium court, which, due to Covid-19, was missing the thousands of rowdy New York tennis fans that usually flock to Queens every year.
After a dominant start, Djokovic struggled in the second set and lost his temper even after closing it out.
“I thought I started very well, a set and a break (up) then things got complicated,” a masked Djokovic said in courtside interview.
“I lost my focus, he started missing less and he put some good variety in the game ... he came up with some good shots and it was anybody's game midway through the second set.”
In the end Dzumhur, who hails from Bosnia and Herzegovina, had no answer to the world No.1’s blistering serve and stout defence in a match that lasted just under two hours.
Germany's Alexander Zverev survived a tricky first-round test to beat 2017 finalist Kevin Anderson 7-6 (7-2), 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.
The health protocols here is making things a bit tough for world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas. The Greek stormed into the second round with a 6-2, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Albert Ramos-Vinolas and spent his entire post-match news conference discussing his relationship with the humble towel.
 “It has huge importance, the towel. I use it very often. It gives me time to think, gives me time to refresh myself and think about my tactics,” he said.
Health protocols put in place at Flushing Meadows this year forbid ballkids from handing players their towels between points, as they usually would at most elite tour events.
Denis Shapovalov did not get his choice of court for his first round match and was delighted to get out of Louis Armstrong Stadium with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over American wild card Sebastian Korda.
The Canadian revealed after his opener that he had asked tournament director Stacey Allaster not to put him on the second showcourt, where his tournaments came to an end with five-set defeats at the last two US Opens. American teen sensation Coco Gauff was eliminated from the first round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
Gauff, whose run to the third round ignited last year's tournament, bowed out 3-6, 7-5, 4-6 to Anastasija Sevastova at an empty Louis Armstrong Stadium.
“I could have played better today,” Gauff told reporters. “I just got on Tour a little over a year ago, so I still have a lot to learn and a long ways to go.”",sports
US Open 2020: Karolina Pliskova eases into Round II," Top seed Karolina Pliskova got off to a roaring start in her bid for a maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open on Monday, downing first-round opponent Anhelina Kalinina 6-4, 6-0 to kick off action in Arthur Ashe Stadium here.
“I think my game was quite good for a first round,” said Pliskova, the world No. 3, who played in front of empty stands with crowd noise piped in as the tournament is being held without fans due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Former champion Angelique Kerber, seeded 17th, returned to action after seven months and beat Australian Ajla Tomljanovic 6-4, 6-4. The German overcame a shaky start on serve and got better as the 88-minute match at Louis Armstrong Stadium wore on.
Sixth seed Petra Kvitova had an easy first round against Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania, sweeping aside the unseeded player 6-2, 6-3.
“It’s not easy to play your first match after such a long time and it was my first match after Australia (Open) so I’m really happy how I played,” said Kerber. “It’s always a little bit different to play points, and especially a match, than playing just practice points so I am happy how I did the transition to the match court.”
Kerber was sidelined with a leg injury before the Covid-19 outbreak forced a shutdown of global tennis in March and did not compete in last week’s warm-up event played on the site of the US Open.
But despite the lack of recent competitive action, the 32-year-old former world No.1 needed only a handful of games to shake off the rust and never looked back as she improved her career record against Tomljanovic to 2-0.",sports
Anand eyes future kings & queens," Thirtythree years ago, the world junior chess championship win had motivated Viswanathan Anand to scale greater heights. Now, in 2020, the five-time world champion hopes India’s Chess Olympiad triumph on Sunday will give confidence to youngsters like Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Nihal Sarin to go for the summit.
India and Russia were declared joint winners of the 2020 Online Chess Olympiad after Internet disconnection and server malfunction disrupted the final. This was India’s maiden triumph in the Olympiad.
“The world junior chess title had helped me to understand that I can take on the world. Next year I became the Grandmaster (he was India’s first GM) and then everything else followed…. Five world titles, so on and so forth.
“I hope this win will inspire Praggya and Nihal to aim higher. They should now target 2700-plus Elo ratings and dream of becoming world champions,” Anand told The Telegraph from Chennai on Monday evening.
Both Praggnanandhaa (15) and 16-year-old Nihal are Grandmasters and are seen as the future of Indian chess.

“By becoming Grandmasters at such a young age, they have already proved that they are on the right track. It’s just that they needed a boost. Sunday’s triumph will act like a springboard for them. I am also confident that girls like Divya Deshmukh (14), Vaishali Rameshbabu (19 and Praggya’s sister) and Vantika Agarwal (18) would do very well in the future. We all knew that Indian chess has the depth, this victory drove home that point,” Anand added.
Anand said the title was a nice addition to his overflowing trophy cabinet. “Yes, it’s a good addition to my cabinet. This one was missing and am happy that it’s finally done. We were always on course for a title in the Chess Olympiad. Do not forget we got the bronze in 2014,” Anand, who sat out the first round and drew with world No.4 Ian Nepomniachtchi in the second, said.
Sunday was dramatic though. Nihal and Divya lost their Internet connections and time, which gave Russia a 4.5-1.5 win in the second round. After India appealed for a review, it was found that there was a global Internet outage and Fide announced both the teams as joint winners.
Anand said connectivity loss is something which is part and parcel of online chess.
“These things will keep happening. The main problem arises when the electricity comes back… Your router takes some seconds to move from the generator mode to normality. In chess, that loss of seconds (around 30 seconds) can prove costly. Also, with so many people logging in to watch duels online, with so much of live streaming and video uploading, chances of a global outage are always there.”
In the group stage, India were held by Mongolia from a commanding position after team captain Vidit Gujrathi and Koneru Humpy lost
their matches on time. Later, it was found out that both Vidit and Humpy lost their Internet connections and their time ran out.
Then, in the quarter finals between India and Armenia, the latter staged a walkout from the second round after a Haik Martirosyan move against Nihal wasn’t registered by the system. “I guess you have to bear with these things,” was Anand’s take.
On Monday afternoon, during an online media conference of the Indian chess team, Anand shared an interesting tale. “During the quarters or the semis, there was a proposed power cut in my area in Chennai from 9 in the morning till 5 in the evening. Srinath (Narayanan, non-playing captain) called and told me that he had spoken to TNEB (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board) and they had agreed to restore the power three hours early and promised not to disrupt power supply till the final. Srinath has a huge fan following in my apartment now!”
Anand heaped praise on the world body for coming up with the online Olympiad this time. “It was a game-changing move.” Anand has a message for the All India Chess Federation though. The AICF is engaged in a bitter factional fight between the PR Venketrama Raja group and supporters of Bharat Singh Chauhan. Interestingly, in the build-up to the Chess Olympiad, both the factions had named different squads.
The last time the 64-square game saw an Arjuna awardee was in 2013, when Abhijeet Gupta got the prize, while a chess coach has been given the Dronacharya just twice — Raghunandan Vasant Gokhale (1986) and Koneru Ashok, Humpy’s father, in 2006. That was 14 years ago.
“It’s time the AICF settles the differences and moves on. The sooner they do, the better it’s for the game in the country. Also, I think Sunday’s win will give an impetus to chess. Now we can walk up to the ministry and tell them that, ‘Look, we have done our part. It’s up to you guys now’.”  ",sports
India and Russia declared joint winners," India and Russia were on Sunday declared joint winners of the 2020 Online Chess Olympiad after the final was marred by internet disconnection and server malfunction.
Russia were initially declared winners after two Indian players — Nihal Sarin and Divya Deshmukh — lost out on time in the final after suffering a disconnection with the server.
India lodged a protest against the controversial decision which was reviewed.
This was the first time Fide, the international chess federation, was holding the Olympiad in an online format, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.",sports

Honour for pool pioneer," As a 10-year-old, he was literally in deep waters when he swam for his life, trying to escape being trapped in a police lathicharge on civil disobedience volunteers by jumping into the Ganges in Varanasi.
But that incident, in 1930, was just the beginning of Sachin Nag’s bond with swimming. Nag went on to represent India at the 1948 Olympics, was a member of the Indian water polo team in the 1952 Olympics and was also a multiple medal winner, including a gold in 100m freestyle, in the 1951 Asian Games.
Yet, the legendary swimmer, who passed away in 1987, did not quite get the recognition he deserved. That would be corrected somewhat on Saturday when he posthumously receives the prestigious Dhyan Chand Award for lifetime achievement in sports. Nag’s son Ashoke would receive the award on his behalf.
“We had been fighting for some form of government recognition for a long time and we are very relieved that he is finally being given the honour he deserved,” Ashoke told The Telegraph.
Nag’s eventful life’s ebb and flow were intriguing.

He came to Calcutta in 1937 to sharpen his swimming skills. That too is an interesting story. He was spotted by Jamini Das, former swimmer and then an official of Hatkhola Club. Das took some trainees from his club to Varanasi to participate in a long-distance swimming competition. As it turned out, a raw Nag beat the highly trained Calcutta swimmers hands down. Das lost no time in advising the young man to relocate to Calcutta.
A year later, he came first in 100m and 400m freestyle in all Bengal swimming competition. Those days, such competitions would be held at the College Square.
His real aim, however, was to compete in the Olympics. Yet, in January 1947, barely a year before the 1948 Olympics, he met with a near-fatal accident. His femur was shattered when he was hit by a stray bullet. It’s hard to piece together how exactly the accident took place, but, according to his son, it happened all of a sudden when he was walking back from a training session.
Nag’s future as a swimmer was under severe threat. The surgeons advised him to rest for at least two years. But a stubborn Nag resumed training in six months.
Recovering from a major injury was a serious enough concern, but by no means the only one for Nag. He didn’t have enough money to travel to London for the Olympics. Athletes representing the country those days had to bear a large part of their expenses themselves.
Never the one to give up, Nag took to washing goods vehicles at Burrabazar in the wee hours before training. But five months before the Olympics, he was still a few thousand rupees short.
A downcast Nag was finally about to give up on his long cherished dream when someone relayed the plight of this talented swimmer to the singer Hemanta Mukhopadhyay. Mukhopadhyay immediately arranged for a fund raising campaign, including a musical performance at the Uttara Cinema hall at Hatibagan in North Calcutta. That is how Nag realised his Olympic dream.
Nag’s contribution to swimming was not only limited to his exploits in the pool. Arati Saha, who was the first Asian woman to cross the English Channel in 1959, was trained by Nag. He was also the chief swimming instructor at Calcutta Club for more than three decades. Nafisa Ali, national swimming champion of the early 1970s who was also crowned Miss India, too trained under Nag.
“He always wanted to groom the next generation. We, as a family, would like to follow that to honour his legacy. We are ready to help young talents and even set up an academy if possible,” Ashoke said.

A week into the lockdown, Munna and Sonu — aged 11 and 12, respectively — started feeling pangs of hunger.
Many other budding hockey players, who train at Entally Hockey Academy, were faced with an almost similar situation as the state announced complete lockdown in March. But all of them still dare to dream, thanks to the academy.
The academy has gone out of its way to help players survive this pandemic and keep their dreams alive. It provided food and other items of necessity to its trainees. The provisions were given every week since the last week of March for two months.
It has also extended a helping hand to the families of some of the players. “We have some very promising players and we can’t just let them suffer in this pandemic situation. At a time when Bengal hockey is at its nadir, we have to keep these young players’ dreams alive to help keep the game afloat in the state,” said Subir Kumar Pan, the secretary-cum-coach of Entally Hockey Academy.
The academy distributed the items not only among its 50 trainees, but also to around 2,000 underprivileged families in the Entally area. They gave all players a new kit on Independence Day and has plans to distribute more kits on Saturday, the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand.

“We have a few players who can’t even afford a jersey or boots. Munna is a brilliant forward and he has a never-say-die attitude, but his biggest problem now is that he plays with borrowed boots that are bigger than his feet,” said Pan.
Swarnendu Barui, who has been representing Bengal in the under-14 category for the last three years and was the captain of the side last year, said: “I have been training at the academy for the last five years and never did I have to worry about my jersey, shorts or boots. The academy has always provided me with all those things. When the lockdown began, my father, a cab driver, was finding it difficult to run the family. The academy helped us a lot and now I’m confident of pursuing my dream of donning the India jersey one day.”",sports
CPL 2020: Join to become the greatest cricket fan," The 2020 Caribbean Premier League competition takes place between August 18th and September 10th. The 6 CPL teams will set up base in Trinidad for 3 weeks with the aim of becoming this years CPL champion
Covid19 has caused a change to the format and location of the matches for this renewal but the cricketing public has a strong sense of anticipation for this CPL. As the first franchise tournament since the pandemic began, CPL 2020 will bring a degree of sporting relief to cricket supporters across the globe.
The CPL 2020 has attracted some of the world's leading exponents of T20 Cricket and possibly the most exciting star on show is Afghan spinner Rashid Khan. Khan will line up for defending champions Barbados Tridents and he will team up with explosive English batsman Alex Hales. Hales is out of the national team picture with England right now due to disciplinary breaches but his hard hitting style should excite Tridents fans during this year's competition. 
Pravin Tambre will become the first Indian to take part in the CPL when he debuts for the Trinbago Knight Riders. The Knight Riders can also call upon the services of Sunil Narine who for many pundits is classed as the games most deadly bowler. The Guyana Amazon Warriors have retained almost all of their squad from 2019 whilst adding the elegant Kiwi Ross Taylor to their batting ranks. The St Kitts and Nevis Patriots have a somewhat Australian feel to their line up with Chris Lynn and Ben Dunk both representative of impressive signings. The Tallawahs have local superstars Andre Russell and Rovman Powell in their stellar squad. One man who will not be gracing the CPL 2020 is gun batsman Chris Gayle. Gayle was expected to line up for the St Lucia Zouks but the legendary opener has decided to take a hopefully short break from Cricket. With Gayle an absentee, Darren Sammy will play an even more crucial role in leading the Zouks this year. 
The competition also sees a new entrant to the Indian sportsbook scene. IndiBet will be launching their new CricketBook product to coincide with the start of CPL. IndiBet has big plans to shake up the sports betting landscape with a unique approach designed to target a mix of sportsbook bettors and exchange traders. The CricketBook itself employs an ‘under one roof’ format. It pairs traditional ‘Fancy’ style prices alongside Over and Under fixed odds markets. The principle aim of the site is to create an environment where every type of cricket punter can find the type of bet they are looking for. The Cricketbook offers a huge array of cricket betting odds options ranging from the method of the next dismissal to the total number of wides bowled to the number of runs scored from every single delivery. There are literally hundreds of betting options provided.
The IndiBet brand will be the main shirt sponsor of CPL team, the St Lucia Zouks. The hope is that the CPL can act as a springboard for future success for a sportsbook which still has many new innovations to unveil. The site not only has its unique, unrivalled CricketBook, it also offers an Exchange, online casino and slots and in the near future it will also launch a Football product tailored for an Indian audience. Customers will be able to watch the match action live when registering and logging in to bet as well being able to utilise a number of modern features such as in play statistics and live match trackers. There are numerous payment methods and promotions and new customers registering to bet on the CPL can also expect a series of regular ‘odds boost offers’ to further whet their appetite. 
IndiBet obviously hopes the CPL will be a big winner for their brand, but who is most likely to win on the field? We asked the Cricket traders at IndiBet to provide us with their lowdown on the movers and shakers in this renewal of the CPL, here are their thoughts:
The defending champions, the Barbados Tridents are sure to defend their crown vigorously. The Tridents have a strong group of players to select from and in Rashid Khan they have the competition's star man. Jamaica and Trinbago look the biggest threat to the Tridents. Trinbago have an equally impressive spin threat to Khan in the shape of Sunil Narine and they also possess a squad that is jam packed with West Indian talent. Leading CPL wicket taker Dwayne Bravo can be a threat with bat and ball whilst Kieron Pollard has the batting power to change the course of any match. The Tallawahs can call upon Glen Phillips, master blaster Andre Russell and West Indian T20 captain Rovman Powell. If Sandeep Lamichane performs well with the ball in hand, it may be that Jamaica can prove victorious in 2020
The CPL is such a closely fought affair that no team can be ruled out when discussing possible winners. Guyana may be able to build upon last season's successful group stage and kick on into the knockout fixtures. If the Patriots are to challenge then much will depend on Aussie Chris Lynn. Sohail Tanvir holds the record for the most 5 wicket hauls in the CPL, if he enjoys a strong CPL this year then his double act with Lynn could see the Patriots go close. The St Lucia Zouks will also fancy their chances of springing a surprise. Being led by Darren Sammy is certainly an advantage. 
And who are the IndiBet team predicting to be victorious? We asked their Cricket stats guru, Peter Andrews, to give us his final verdict: 
‘I see the September 10th final being a straight shoot out between 2 of the games deadliest spinners, Khan vs Narine as the Barbados Tridents do battle with the Trinbago Knight Riders. Home advantage may just swing it this year and with every game being played in Trinidad, I am tipping the Knight Riders as 2020 CPL winners. Having said this, as proud sponsors of the St Lucia Zouks, everyone at IndiBet is fully behind Darren Sammy and his team in their quest to win this year's competition. We feel the Zouks have a wonderful opportunity to spring a surprise and take the trophy back to St Lucia. We will certainly be cheering on the Zouks and looking to provide new IndiBet customers with a range of special offers, promotions and odds boosts so that they too can back the Zouks.’",sports
"Looked like a maverick, destroyed whatever came in front of him: Holding lauds unflappable Dhoni"," A maverick who destroyed every opposition and managed to look unflappable while he was at it -- that's how West Indies great Michael Holding remembers former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in international cricket, a stint which ended on August 15.

Dhoni, the only captain to have won all the ICC trophies, retired from international cricket more than a year after he last played for India -- the lost World Cup semifinal against New Zealand -- announcing the decision on social media.

Holding, like others, only had effusive praise to offer for the 39-year-old.

""When Dhoni first started to play ODIs for India that long flowing locks that we call it in the Caribbean, he looked like a maverick. He looked like someone who came out there just to destroy whatever comes in front of him and he pretty much did that,"" Holding said on his youtube channel.
Dhoni sported many different hairstyles in his career but it was his long mane of the early days that became a the talk of the town.

Hailing his big-hitting prowess, Holding said, ""Throughout his career he hit 229 sixes (in ODIs). When you think of those numbers you must be think he must have played for 40 years to have hit so many sixes and fours. But that is the nature of the man. ""As he grew some grey around his temple area then he had to tone it down a bit and he was lot more controlled with his batting. Anyone watching MS Dhoni in the middle would know he was always in control, unflappable, never ever he looked out of control,"" he added.

The stumper-batsman, who led India to victory in the T20 World Cup, the ODI World Cup and the Champions Trophy, is widely considered one of the greatest captains in international cricket and earned respect for his foresight on the cricket field.

""What a captain he was, how successful he was...When he was captaining, you never saw him get excited,"" said Holding, a member of the famous pace quartet of the West Indies in the 1970s.

""If things seemed to be slipping, he would call his players, have a chat calmly and then they would go back to wherever they were and things would automatically change, that was the kind of influence he had.""

In 98 Tests, Dhoni scored 4,876 runs with 256 catches and 38 stumpings, while amassing 10,773 runs with 321 catches and 123 stumpings in 350 ODIs.

In T20Is, he aggregated 1617 runs with 57 catches and 34 stumpings. He scored six centuries in Tests and 10 in ODIs.

Holding said it is ""commendable"" that Dhoni could score nearly 5000 Test runs and also do justice to his keeping job throughout his career.

""What a career this man had, a fantastic one. This man made almost 5,000 Test runs and remember, he's not a pure batsman, he's a wicket-keeper. Over such a long career, to be able keep wickets and do such a fantastic job is commendable,"" said the 66-year-old.

""To be bending down for so many years, keeping himself fit through all these years. He has close to 11,000 runs in ODIs...,"" said Holding, one of the most respected voices in international cricket.",sports
The men who matter," A season like no other
The 2019/20 UEFA Champions League will finally reach its climax tonight in Lisbon. Here’s why this campaign has been one of a kind.

A football marathon
When the current UCL campaign got underway with its qualifying rounds on June 25 , 2019, we were all living in a different world. Some 14 months and 118 games later, comes the decisive fixture to complete the longest European season in history. The sheer length of the UCL over the past year is a direct product of the scheduling reshuffle caused due to Covid-19, which ensured that no Champions League ball was kicked for around five months of 2020 between the middle of March and mid-August. But against the odds of a global pandemic, quarantine regulations, empty stadiums and a whole catalogue of protocols, UEFA have pulled it off — the UCL will have a winner this season, after all!
Once in a lifetime
The unprecedented circumstances have necessitated a format overhaul for the Champions League this term. Instead of the traditional two-legged knockout ties till the final (played home and away for the participants), this year has seen standalone knockout games played at the neutral venues of Lisbon. While UEFA will not repeat this setup from next season (pandemic permitting, of course!), this World Cup-esque layout has proven to be extremely entertaining, with a series of goal-laden, expansive matches that can only be generated by the desperation that ensues from knowing that one night decides everything.

The usual suspects go missing
This season marks the first time since 2005 when neither Lionel Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo has played any part in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Messi’s Barcelona were sent packing in the last eight while Ronaldo’s Juventus were edged out on away goals in the round of 16, depriving CR7 of a return to Portugal for the business end of the competition. With just the seven goals between them, this term will also mark the first time since Kaka in 2007 that someone not named Messi or Ronaldo will finish as outright
top-scorer of the UCL, with Robert Lewandowski leading the charts with 15 strikes.
Outrageous outcomes
The Champions League is no stranger to thrills, spills and sensational shocks, but this pandemic-ravaged season has seen some truly remarkable results. Liverpool’s exit to Atletico Madrid in the round of 16 marked the worst title defence by any team since Chelsea in 2012. RB Leipzig, founded only in 2009, managed a historic run to the semis. Unfancied Lyon upset two heavyweights in Juventus and Manchester City. And, of course, Bayern Munich notched up the most glaring scoreline in modern club football history by smashing a hapless Barcelona 8-2 in the quarter-finals. After injuries sidelined him from the pivotal junctures of the Champions League in 2018 and 2019, Neymar (above left) has returned with a vengeance this time around. Dazzling his way through defenders in Lisbon, the Brazilian superstar has been PSG’s shining light up front. At the other end, Bayern Munich’s ever reliable custodian, Manuel Neuer, has reclaimed his status as one of the world’s finest goalkeepers after an indifferent couple of years. The German icon would have been disappointed not to keep a clean sheet as his team swept past Barcelona, and would be determined to thwart PSG’s swashbuckling attack in the final. Although neither is a stranger to the grand occasions, Neymar could have a psychological edge, courtesy their meeting five years ago, when the Brazilian (then at Barcelona) put three goals past Neuer in the semi-finals. Arguably the most complete centre-half of his generation, Silva has been imperious for PSG at the back and will be playing in his last game for the club in the final. Tasked with denying Lewandowski, Silva has to be watchful throughout, for the Polish sharpshooter has been in scintillating form and will be eyeing Ronaldo’s 17-goal record in a single UCL season. What makes this contest compelling is the movement of Lewandowski, who will run the channels and drop deep to try and lure Silva away from the heart of the Paris defence. Silva, for his part, will also be responsible for building play from the back. Physically, technically and tactically, this could turn out to be the most influential match-up in the final. Football’s brightest prodigy, Mbappe, still looks slightly short of full fitness, but that has not stopped him from electrifying the knockouts, linking lethally with Neymar, in particular. With a host of trophies already on his resume, including the World Cup, the 21-year-old Frenchman will be gunning to add the holy grail of the European game to his cabinet. Playing on PSG’s left flank, Mbappe will line up against Bayern’s Kimmich, who has exceeded expectations to seamlessly slot into the position vacated by club legend Philipp Lahm in 2017. Kimmich’s endurance and discipline make him a coach’s delight, and the full-back remains one of the few players capable of covering every blade of grass in the final. Both Mbappe and Kimmich possess frightening speed and have the footballing intelligence to understand one another’s weaknesses. Whoever wins this showdown on the wings could well launch their respective team to glory. It was Kimpembe’s handball that led to a last-minute penalty and eventual elimination for PSG in last season’s competition against Manchester United. But the French defender has redeemed himself with a string of impressive performances this season. Last-ditch tackles, aerial prowess and composure on the ball are his biggest strengths, and he will have his pockets full in trying to channelise all these traits against the relentless Thomas Muller (above right). After a disappointing 2019, Muller has bounced back like a man on a mission, bursting with energy and seemingly incapable of making a mistake in attack. Muller’s unteachable knack for finding spaces will make life difficult for the young Kimpembe, with the Frenchman also needing to keep an eye out for potential combinations between Muller and Lewandowski in the final third. Popping up with priceless goals in the quarters and the semis, Marquinhos (top) has been indispensable for PSG, excelling both in defence and as a holding midfielder. Against the Brazilian’s tenacity and exemplary anticipatory skills will be the vision and metronomic precision of Thiago Alcantara (above), who has run the Bayern midfield with graceful ease thus far. As the heartbeat of the Bayern juggernaut, Alcantara will be the one looking for the penetrating pass to unlock the PSG defence. With a move to Liverpool imminent, this could be his swan song in a Bayern shirt, and the Spaniard will be keen to emulate his legendary compatriots, Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta, in pulling the strings in a UCL final. But for that to come to pass, he would have to find a way past Marquinhos first. The facts and figures that matter from the Champions League final

Zero: The number of Champions League titles Paris Saint-Germain have to their name. 2020 will be PSG’s first appearance in the final.
1: Only one final has finished goalless in the Champions League — way back in 2003, when AC Milan drew 0-0 with Juventus, before the former prevailed on penalties.
2.81: The average number of goals UCL finals have produced in the past, with the most coming in 2005 when Liverpool and AC Milan scored three each.
4: Germany has contributed a total of four referees in the UCL final, more than any other nation, with Felix Brych the last German to be in charge, in 2017.
5: The number of times Bayern Munich have won the Champions League (including its predecessor, the European Cup). Bayern’s last triumph came in 2013, when they won at Wembley to clinch a historic treble.
7: No player may have scored a hat-trick in a UCL final yet, but seven different players have netted two: Daniele Massaro (1994), Karl-Heinz Riedle (1997), Hernan Crespo (2005), Filippo Inzaghi (2007), Diego Milito (2010), Cristiano Ronaldo (2017), and Gareth Bale (2018).
7: Lisbon’s Estadio da Luz will become the seventh stadium to host a Champions League final more than once this Sunday. The other six include Munich’s Olympiastadion (only one with three finals), Rome’s Olimpico, Athens’ Olympic Stadium, Saint-Denis’ Stade de France, Milan’s San Siro and London’s Wembley Stadium.
17: The number of times both teams have scored at least once in a UCL final, the last being Real Madrid’s 3-1 victory over Liverpool in 2018.
28: PSG vs Bayern will be the 28th final in the Champions League era since Europe’s premier club competition was revamped in 1992-93.
42: The total number of goals Bayern Munich have scored in this season’s UCL, 17 more than second-highest-scorers PSG.
90,245: The highest attendance at a UCL final, recorded in 1999 at Barcelona’s Camp Nou, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich. This year’s final, of course, will be played behind closed doors, with zero fan attendance.
$22.5 million: The prize money to be claimed by the winners of this season’s UCL, with $18 million waiting for the runners-up.

Merit shadow on national sports awards choices," Sukhdev Singh Pannu won the Dronacharya Award in 2018 for the impressive performances of his ward, triple jumper and Jakarta Asian Games gold medal winner Arpinder Singh.
Cut to 2020, Arpinder’s agonising wait only grows longer as the credentials that got his coach a national recognition weren’t good enough to fetch him an Arjuna Award.
The names picked for the national sports awards have raised several eyebrows with officials and athletes wondering whether merit had been given due recognition.
Asian Games bronze medallist in mixed team event and Commonwealth Games individual gold medallist, Manika Batra, is one of the five persons recommended for the prestigious Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award.
This, when she got the Arjuna Award in 2018 for the same performances which have been considered as the yardstick to get the country’s highest sporting honour.

It’s only coincidental that post the Arjuna award, her form has dipped and she has now slipped to No. 63 in the world rankings.
The choice of Vishesh Bhriguvanshi, the men’s national basketball team captain, for the Arjuna has also raised eyebrows. The last recorded performance of the men’s team was a 14th place finish among 16 nations during the Asian Championship in Beirut.
Ajay Sawant from tent-pegging or kho-kho player Sarika Kale made the cut for the Arjuna Awards on the basis of the sports ministry’s new policy where athletes from indigenous sports need to be rewarded.
So despite a well-earned Asian Games gold medal, bridge players Shibnath Sarkar and Pranab Bardhan will have to wait.
This year, when there is hardly any action due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, the 12-member selection committee for the national sports awards, headed by retired Justice Mukundakam Sharma, had initially recommended as many as 62 names for awards in different categories.
Five for Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, 29 for Arjuna, 13 for Dronacharya (including eight lifetime) and 15 for the Dhyan Chand Award.
The sports ministry on Friday announced that the list had been pruned to 60. Sakshi Malik and Mirabai Chanu, who won the Khel Ratna in 2016 and 2018 respectively, would not get this year’s Arjuna.
Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, considered India’s only world class track and field athlete, and badminton star Srikanth Kidambi have been ignored for the Khel Ratna.
“I am not against any award winner. Congratulations to all of them. But it was disappointing that Neeraj’s name was not considered for the Khel Ratna. Arpinder also should have got the Arjuna this year,” Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla told The Telegraph on Friday.
Neeraj has been a consistent performer on the international scene winning the gold in the Asian Games, as well as the Commonwealth Games. He was also the 2016 world junior champion.
One official, who refused to be quoted, was livid.
“It seems there is a conscious effort to undermine the role of some associations. How can you put say AFI, which manages 48 disciplines, and kho-kho or football in the same bracket? If you ignore credentials of achievers, what motivation would they get to perform in future? It’s time the sports ministry takes a serious look at how these awards are being given,” he said.
Cricketer Rohit Sharma and women’s hockey captain Rani Rampal, wrestler Vinesh Phogat and 2016 Paralympic gold medallist Mariyappan Thangavelu have also been recommended for the Khel Ratna along with Manika.
Manika, interestingly, would be the first table tennis player to get the Khel Ratna which started from 1991-92.
“From the table tennis point of view, it’s good news. But I would have loved to see performers like Neeraj and Srikanth also on the list,” Sharath Kamal, India’s top paddler and Manika’s partner in the 2018 Asian Games bronze medal-winning feat, said from Chennai.
A former world No. 1 (briefly in 2018), Srikanth won the four Super Series titles in 2017 but hasn’t done anything worthwhile in 2019.
“His name was not considered because the committee thought his performance in the last two years was not up to the mark,” a source said.
“But it was nice to see the doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy winning the Arjuna. It’s a first in badminton,” a Badminton Association of India (BAI) official added.  ",sports
"Gopichand: camps resume, debate rages"," Indian sport has pressed the restart button, albeit in a staggered way, over the last two and half months.
The resumption of training though has been blighted by news of sportspersons and coaching staff testing positive for Covid-19. That, once again, has brought to the fore the debate on whether it's the right time to take the plunge.
""Covid-19 is not something that will go away in the next 10 days. So you have to figure out how to deal with it without hampering training. In my facility (SAI-Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy) the residential part is still closed. They are practising at the Academy and going home. Sometime or the other you have to start. So why not today?"" national coach Gopichand told The Telegraph from Hyderabad.
The Sports Authority of India (SAI) had allowed the camp for eight Olympic hopefuls to begin following the approval from the Telangana government on August 1, but only four are currently training at the academy.
Last week, SAI had through a statement said shuttler N Sikki Reddy and physiotherapist Kiran C had tested positive for coronavirus. Both of them are part of the ongoing national camp and were asymptomatic.
The duo again got tested and after their reports came negative, the camp resumed from Monday.
However, questions were raised from some quarters if the SAI was right in going ahead with the camp without creating a bio-bubble.
The shuttlers are not staying in a bio-secure environment, even though the academy does have space to accommodate players and coaches.
""We started the national camp (on August 7) with a few Olympic hopefuls following all the safety protocols. The part where Sikki practised was closed after sanitising. My message would be 'do not live in fear, start training',"" Gopi added.
Hockey is one discipline which also believes in Gopi's way of thinking. Despite six men's team players, including captain Manpreet Singh and Mandeep Singh, testing positive, SAI went ahead with the men's and women's camps at SAI Bangalore from Wednesday. The affected six, in the meantime, had recovered and were discharged from the hospital.
The decision to go ahead with the camp though drew flak from former India captain Zafar Iqbal. ""It beats me, frankly. Six players had Covid-19, and there will be a camp! We do not have anything before next April. So why are we hell bent on organising a camp now?"" he said.
India's next assignment is the men's Asian Hockey Champions Trophy - scheduled to be held from November 17 to 27 in Dhaka. It is likely to be postponed, and that's why Iqbal is questioning the need to continue with the camp.
The world badminton federation (BWF) though announced that Thomas and Uber Cups would be played from October 3-11 in Aarhus, Denmark.
""My point is simple. If our respected home minister (Amit Shah) can get affected, it can happen to anybody. Virus doesn't see who you are,"" shooting coach Jaspal Rana reasoned.
The National Rifle Association of India postponed its plans for a centralised camp for its Olympic core group shooters at the Karni Singh Shooting Range in New Delhi from August 1 after one women's team coach tested positive and some shooters from outside the National Capital Region voiced their apprehensions about travelling from their respective native places.
 ""When you are travelling it's risky. You may contract the disease from the person handling your ammunition. Isn't it? So I am against centralised training at this point in time,"" Jaspal, whose name has been recommended for this year's Dronacharya Award, said.
Mansher Singh, the chief coach of the Indian shotgun team said all the shooting ranges should be open post-September. ""That's my view. Let's open up, after September. In shooting, anyway, you always maintain social distancing. I would advocate pre-booked sessions, which will allow less number of people in the range,"" he said.
Archer Atanu Das also believes that some time or other sporting activities have to start. Archery camp begins from August 25 at the Army Sports Institute in Pune.
""We have to begin. How long can we wait? But bio-secure environment is a must. Like when we reach Pune, we will be quarantined for 14 days and then the camp begins for 15 days as of now. The duration may get extended later,"" Atanu, who is in line for this year's Arjuna Award, said.
Both Gopi and Atanu however said the time hasn't come for tournaments yet. ""May be a league where you have six participating teams with five players and seven support staff. So that makes around 72 people. You keep them in one hotel and they can travel to the venue for the matches. That can happen. But if you ask me about badminton nationals, I am sorry, not yet,"" was Gopi's take.
""With so many athletes, tournaments will be very risky,"" said Atanu. ""Let's start with camps first.""",sports
"BCCI rejects Dream11 bids For IPL 2021,2022"," The BCCI on Wednesday announced fantasy gaming platform Dream11 as this year's IPL title sponsor but the company will not stay on board for the next two seasons after its conditional three-year proposal was rejected due to ""low"" bid amounts for 2021 and 2022.
Dream11 pipped educational technology companies BYJUs and Unacademy to win the rights for a period of four months and 13 days with a bid of Rs 222 crore, replacing Chinese mobile phone company Vivo.
""The IPL Governing Council has announced Dream11 as the new Title Sponsor of the 2020 edition of the Indian Premier League. Dream11 (Sporta Technologies Pvt. Ltd) is an Indian company based in Mumbai, Maharashtra,"" a BCCI statement said on Wednesday, confirming what IPL chairman Brijesh Patel had stated on Tuesday.
Dream11 offered to pay Rs 240 crore for years two and three in case Vivo did not come back. Vivo was forced to pull out of its Rs 440 crore per year deal this season due to the Sino-India border stand-off.
Sources said BCCI and Dream11 negotiated on the conditional three-year bid and the board asked the company to raise the amount considerably for the next two seasons.

""Dream11 bid the highest but why will BCCI give them the rights for Rs 240 crore when we can expect the COVID-19 situation to improve in the next two years,"" a veteran BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.
""We still have our deal with Vivo on. We haven't closed it as it's a pause. If we are getting Rs 440 crore, why will we settle for Rs 240 crore?"" the official asked.
Dream11's association with sports has grown over the years and it is presently partnering a total of 19 leagues along with six Indian Premier League Franchises.
""We welcome Dream11 on board as Title Sponsor for the 2020 edition of the IPL. Dream11 upgrading their association from an Official Partner to Title Sponsors is a great testament to the brand IPL,"" IPL chairman Patel was quoted as saying in the BCCI press release.
""As a digital brand it will give them leverage to create exciting online engagement for fans sitting at home and watching the matches. We look forward to delivering great value to Dream11,"" he added.
Harsh Jain, CEO and Co-founder, Dream Sports, said: ""Being a proud homegrown Indian brand that is made in India, by Indians and exclusively for Indian sports fans, we would like to thank the BCCI for giving us an opportunity to become the title sponsor of IPL.""
It is expected that BCCI will open fresh bids for 2021 and 2022 in case Vivo doesn't come back but the world's richest cricket board won't settle for anything less than Rs 400 crore.",sports
Tribute to MS Dhoni," With Mahendra Singh Dhoni announcing his international retirement, a Dhoni-sceptic-turned-devotee reflects on the providential career of Indian cricket’s most decorated leader. The hallmark of greatness is its tendency to be taken for granted, to make the world believe in its inevitability. To convince its audience that no matter the context, the circumstance or the characters, greatness will prevail in its challenges, almost always. For more than 15 years, Mahendra Singh Dhoni represented this exact greatness, frequently converting the impossible into the inevitable, calmly throbbing along as the beating heart of a sport that billions of Indians expect to be synonymous with success.

Against the odds
A mere 22 runs from his first four One Day international innings for India made grim reading for Dhoni. As someone who had just started following cricket as a kid, I took Dhoni for an aberration— an unrefined slogger in a pool of sophisticated Indian strokemakers. Haplessly run out for a duck on debut and dismissed through naive shot selection in the next few games, Dhoni seemed doomed to fail. I wondered why he had been preferred over the prodigious Parthiv Patel and the more aesthetically pleasing Dinesh Karthik.
Soon enough, I stopped wondering. And so did the rest of his doubters. In his fifth ODI, against Pakistan, Dhoni, promoted to bat at three by an apparently whimsical call from then skipper Sourav Ganguly, smashed a swashbuckling 148, rewriting records for an Indian wicket-keeper-batsman. A string of explosive, match-finishing knocks followed, as Dhoni launched an arsenal of missiles from his bat to demolish all questions surrounding his technique and temperament.
Dhoni was not conventionally improper, he just had his own skill set and style, which had been harnessed on the dusty fields of Ranchi instead of the rarefied academies of India’s metropolitan cities. Dhoni was not a carefree maverick who delighted in pummelling the bowling attack, but a calculated big-hitter who combined force and fearlessness with a demonstrable urge to control his own fate.
Breaking into the Indian team from the cricketing backwaters of Jharkhand in a generation of astoundingly gifted players, required daring and determination. Dhoni had plenty of both, plus the street-smartness that came with managing one of the world’s longest railway platforms. In making his journey from a ticket-collector to India’s latest superstar, Dhoni had proven that he was in charge of his own destiny. He alone would write his remarkable script.

Cricket's cerebral assassin
Farokh Engineer, often regarded to be India’s finest pair of hands behind the stumps, can never forget how Dhoni had introduced the veteran to his wife, Sakshi: “If this man were still playing cricket, I would still be stamping tickets in Kharagpur.”
Despite being the only captain to lift all the ICC limited overs’ championships — the World Cup, the World T20, and the Champions Trophy — and promoting everything from car batteries to data storage systems, Dhoni’s humility had not abandoned him at any point during a stellar career. His ability to be modest at the pinnacle of achievement was a small part of the larger psychological armoury that would cement his standing as the game’s sharpest cerebral assassin.
Dialling back in my mind to September 2007, I can recount how I had bitten off all my nails, and was baffled to see the look of composure that wrapped itself like a shield around the Indian captain. It was the occasion of the inaugural World T20 final at Johannesburg, with Misbah-ul-Haq on the verge of steering Pakistan to a famous victory. Dhoni, who had handed the ball in a bewildering move to Joginder Sharma for the last over, had barely emoted as Pakistan moved within striking distance of the title. Joginder was flustered, having conceded a wide and a six to begin the over. Not known for his lengthy advice to bowlers at the time, Dhoni decided to speak. He went up to Joginder, but instead of tactical suggestions, he preferred visceral motivation: “You have bowled so many overs in domestic cricket with such dedication. Don’t worry, cricket will not let you down now.”
The rest, of course, is history. Joginder dismissed Misbah by sticking to his favoured line and length, and India were world champions. Knowing what field to set, which bowler to deploy, and how to inspire the bowler just when it was needed, Dhoni had shown that he was always a step ahead. In the midst of madness at the Wanderers Stadium, as he would be so often thereafter, Dhoni was the monk with the Midas touch.

The myth precedes the man
No single image encompasses the aura around Dhoni better than the shot of his eyes as he hit the World Cup-winning six at the Wankhede Stadium in April 2011. His unflinching gaze, as it tracked the flight of the ball into the stands, symbolised his obsession with the entire process of his profession. Whereas others would have blinked in ecstasy, Dhoni did not lose sight of the ball, even when glory was guaranteed.
Over the years, Dhoni’s triple act as wicket-keeper-batsman-captain involved dealing with pressure on a daily basis. But Dhoni had learnt to make pressure his oxygen. Taking a match deep had become his trademark, for he was aware that the one who cracked under stress earlier would be the one who lost. Faced with Dhoni’s shovel-esque bat and computer-esque brain, it was his opponents who invariably panicked first.
But the aura of Dhoni was much more than the towering last-ball sixes, the acrobatic stumpings, and the no-look run-outs. It also included the breathless singles and doubles he ran like no one else, the tidbits of wisdom he provided (deliberately in Hindi!) to young bowlers in between deliveries, the team meetings before crunch games that would last a few seconds, his refusal to hog the limelight during trophy presentations and the insistence to play in the essence of a gentleman. Moments before a crucial IPL clash with Royal Challengers Bangalore, Michael Hussey stunningly recalls what Dhoni had told his Chennai Super Kings team as they huddled up: “Right guys, big game today against RCB, but the fair play award is really important to me. We’ve got to make sure we play the game in the right spirit.”
Integrity was paramount for Dhoni, which made it all the more ironic that he would stay silent when accusations of match-fixing rocked the IPL in 2015, leading to a two-year ban for CSK. Dhoni’s name was floated among the list of the corrupt and the complicit, though without any foolproof evidence. I was disgruntled to see Dhoni stick to his media-shy reluctance in the face of mounting opprobrium, but just like the times when critics castigated him for his defensive strategies in Test cricket or blamed him for sidelining senior players and practising favouritism, Dhoni was impervious to what others said or felt about him. This, too, after all, was part of the aura of the man. Dhoni did not like to be known, listened to, and understood; and not even his biopic in 2016 could answer the most urgent questions surrounding his enigma, both on and off the field.

Owning the moment
Earlier this year in April, I was working on a documentary project as part of my media course in the United Kingdom when my Irish friend and project partner decided to show me something his brother had got for him from India as a gift. It was not a book on Mahatma Gandhi or a collection of Indian spices or some intricate item of indigenous art. It was a jersey, a shirt bearing the number seven and the name Dhoni. Some 5,000 miles away from home, I was reminded once more of the overwhelming appeal of Dhoni, his continued relevance as an emblem of India.
When I first saw people sharing Dhoni’s Instagram post on August 15, I mistook it for some fan footage, roughly edited with a clever caption. Then I visited his profile, and assured of its authenticity, watched the full video, which coalesced all his significant moments in Indian colours, both good and bad. Then I watched it again and again and again.
Dhoni had done it once more. Once more, he had taken the world by surprise. While I knew that with the postponement of the World T20 his hopes of returning to the Indian team were all but over, I did not foresee such an ending. Instead of a farewell game or a press conference, Dhoni chose an Instagram montage to say goodbye, an eerily appropriate Bollywood song picturised on one of the three people he follows on the social media platform — Amitabh Bachchan, (the other two being his wife and daughter), summing up what Dhoni may have always felt, but never verbalised.
The man who had toyed with time on the pitch — slowing it down with his paraphernalia of rituals before taking guard — had transcended it for a while, allowing everyone else to take stock and reflect. Destiny, which had finally struck back at Dhoni in robbing him of a World Cup final last year, had yet again been mastered, directed to provide a flood of nostalgia in the middle of a pandemic on an Independence Day like no other. In hindsight, like many of Dhoni’s masterstrokes, it seemed the obvious thing to do, the obvious way to go. So obvious that nobody saw it coming.
As I eventually stopped watching the video on loop, it hit me how Dhoni had, in keeping with his temporal precision, mentioned “1929 hrs” as the particular moment in time after which he was to be considered “Retired”. For someone who always lived in the present, Dhoni had owned the moment once more. Not simply owned it, but frozen it in time, capturing his legacy as a cricketing champion in a capsule, even as the rest of his incredible life story keeps ticking along.",sports
Some Captain Cool moments," The news every cricket fan had been dreading for a long, long time, eventually broke on a lazy Saturday evening when most of us were confined to our homes thanks to a global pandemic. Without any kind of a build-up or even a press release, in his own signature style, India’s most successful cricket captain announced his departure from international competitions leaving his fans in shock and pain as even the prospect of never seeing Captain Cool in that blue jersey again leaves his devout fans teary-eyed. For any other cricketer whose international career started and ended with a run out, it would’ve been difficult to define them in any other way but since it is Dhoni — the man who brought the World Cup to a land where the game is a religion, twice — he would be remembered for everything that happened in between. The Telegraph takes a look at the iconic wicketkeeper-batsman’s illustrious international career.
  A forgettable debut
Mahi made his international debut against Bangladesh in an ODI match in Chittagong in 2004. Though he was run out fairly early in the game, little did one know that the tall and lanky batsman from Ranchi would lead India to world domination pretty soon.

A knock to remember
Carrying the weight of his dismal performance on his debut, Dhoni was in dire need of a substantial performance. His first international century —148 off 153 balls against Pakistan in 2005 — silenced his critics and gave the Indian side hope of finding a reliable wicketkeeper-batsman, in what had been a long struggle.

An unlikely skipper
The period from 2004 to 2007 in Dhoni’s international career was full of peaks and troughs. So, it was only natural for experts to question his capability when he was picked captain of the young Indian side that lacked the collective experience and cricket intellect of The Trio — Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly. Not to be deterred by naysayers and critics, a young, long-haired Dhoni not only led India to a glorious victory in the inaugural World T20 Cup but also made an early case for his Captain Cool moniker.

Beginning of an era
For many cricket fans, the 2008 Commonwealth Bank Series marked a tectonic shift in Indian cricket. The omission of key players in the team and the timing of the process raised many questions on Dhoni’s decision-making. Looking back, however, the CB Series victory in Australia marked the beginning of the Dhoni era in Indian cricket.

Glimpse of greatness
After winning the World T20 Cup and proving his capability as a super skipper, Dhoni officially took over the reigns of the Test side in 2008. His impeccable leadership quality and naturally gifted talent of reading the players helped him push the Indian side to the World Number One ranking in 2009, a first for an Indian captain. The domination continued for over 600 days, from 2009 to 2011.

The world at his feet
Mahi’s six off Sri Lankan fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara on the night of April 2, 2011, that landed comfortably in a raucous crowd at Wankhede Stadium, is a memory forever etched in our collective conscious. After all, it was after 28 long years that the World Cup was back in India. Dhoni’s tactical decision to come up the order and a winning knock of 91 off 79 balls earned him the ‘Man of the Match’ award.

The holy trifectas
After a series of disastrous tours of England and Australia followed by an embarrassing loss to England on home soil, Dhoni bounced back in an unprecedented manner. Under his reformed captaincy, India went on to win the 2013 Champions Trophy, making him the first and only captain to win all three limited-overs ICC trophies — the ODI World Cup, World T20 Cup and the Champions Trophy.

Test retirement
After leading many successful campaigns and guiding India towards world dominance, Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, which eventually gave a chance to waiting-in-the wings Wriddhiman Saha. His illustrious Test career comprise 90 international caps 4,876 runs at an average of 38.09.

Last hoorah
After handing over the reins of the ODI team to Virat Kohli in 2017 and an impressive performance at the tour of Australia, Mahi faced scrutiny yet again as he failed to capitalise on crucial situations during the ICC World Cup 2019 campaign. In his last international ODI — the semi-final against an inspired New Zealand — Mahi was the guiding star of India’s fightback but was run out at a crucial moment, resulting in a billion heartbreak. We all knew that it could be the last time we saw Dhoni in an ODI contest — a career that had amassed 10,773 runs, scored at an average of 50.57 in 350 matches.

A second coming
After struggling as a middle-order batsman failing to finish matches for India with his power hits and a lean 2018 season, Dhoni soon bounced back in form with match-winning contributions during the ODI series of India’s Tour of Australia where his power knocks earned him the Player of the Series award.
  Dhoni’s impeccable speed makes him see things that even the umpire misses at times! Here are three instances where Dhoni’s Decision Review System appeals proved to be a shocker.
Vs Pakistan, 2018
Dhoni’s instincts proved crucial during India’s Asian Cup campaign in 2018. After the umpire ruled Pakistan’s Imam-ul-Haq a ‘not out’ for LBW, Dhoni insisted that skipper Rohit Sharma opt for review. Of course the ball was directly in line with stumps!
Vs England, 2018
This time, Dhoni had to use his eagle eyes to save his own wicket. In the 32nd over of India vs England ODI match at Headingley Stadium in Leeds, England’s Moeen Ali caught Mahi off guard with a ripper of a delivery and appealed for an LBW, to which the umpire agreed. Due to Dhoni’s quick calculation, he reviewed the decision. Not out!
Vs KKR, 2018
In a 2018 Indian Premier League fixture, when CSK’s Lungi Ngidi appealed for KKR’s Chris Lynn catch, the umpire signalled ‘not out’ as he believed that the ball had only touched the pad. Mahi, however, had heard an inaudible click and appealed for a review. The bat had in fact nicked the ball.",sports
"Dhoni, the marksman, always hitting bullseye"," Enquiring about importing a rifle, he once sent a mail at around 2am, got it delivered at his Ranchi home, went to the range and did what he does in anything he tries his hand at.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit the bull's eye, fuelling an interest that would see him visit innumerable shooting ranges in the country over the next few years and display his skills in the sport.
The Walther rifle imported by Dhoni, who retired from international cricket on Saturday, is the same model which another champion sportsperson, Abhinav Bindra, had used to win the historic individual gold medal for India at the Olympics.
This was 10 years ago, when Indian shooters were starting to dominate on the world stage and Dhoni, who is now also a life member of National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), was bracing up for what would culminate into his second World Cup title triumph.
The model that he owns is LG300XT Walther Carbontec.

""I once got a mail late at night around 2 AM. As a requirement to import rifles when I asked for the full name and address, he replied within a few minutes with his full name along with his Ranchi address, that's when I realised it was him,"" former India shooter Shimon Sharif, who runs the portal indianshooting.com, said.

""He has had love for guns and shooting since a very long time. Now that he is done with cricket, shooting could be his next sport. We have seen him visiting many shooting ranges.
""I have seen many professional athletes shifting to shooting after retiring from their sport and go on to become Olympic champions. Unlike other sports shooting and golf can be played till a very long time,"" he said.
Sharif is also a top importer of equipment for leading Indian shooters.
In a Twitter video of 2018, Dhoni was also seen trying his hand at pistol shooting. Recently, during an interaction with cricketer Suresh Raina, who retired along with Dhoni, shooter Manavaditya Singh Rathore, who is the son of Olympic silver-medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, revealed that Dhoni is a pro when it comes to shooting as well.
Manavaditya recalled how impressive Dhoni was when the the legendary cricketer visited his house.
""He has a lot of interest in shooting also. I think he hit the target all the time,"" Manavaditya had said.
""After he imported his Walther rifle he was in touch with me and exchanged several mails and even text messages. I had offered to help him to take up the sport but he was too busy then with all his cricketing commitments,"" Sharif said.
""Later we interacted a lot and he even shared his personal number with me. He always used to reply to the messages. In my opinion he is a very friendly and down to earth person.""
Dhoni has exhibited his shooting skills in the past. In 2017, when a team training session was cancelled due to rain in Kolkata, Dhoni headed to the Calcutta Police Training School and tried his hand at pistol shooting.
""His accuracy is breathtaking,"" Calcutta Police was quoted as saying at the time.",sports
Ratul and Komal Sood lay out an occasionwear lookbook for him," Not all men can dress sexy like James Bond, but more often than not, we like them simple yet stylish, with a bit of sophisticated edge and twist. Ratul and Komal Sood’s aesthetics fit like a glove. And, they have created this occasionwear lookbook for men who want to dress understated fashionable. Modelling pro Mohammed Iqbal perfectly complemented squash pro Ramit Tandon for The Telegraph shoot in Kommal & Ratul Sood. The Park played the apt canvas. The album. 

Iqbal loves his fuss-free tracks as well as his tux and his pro advice for Ramit was to “stay cool”.

What was your advice for Ramit?
Oh what fun it was shooting with the man... he is a brilliant guy and was very keen to learn something new and was very excited. My only advice was to stay cool and play it sporty as he represents our nation in squash, which could help him being natural while shooting. He adapted very quickly.
What is your favourite look from the shoot?
My favourite look from the shoot, which is my all-time favourite, is the tux look. It makes you look so elegant, classy and dapper.
What piece of clothing are you currently crushing on?
Personally I go for easy-breezy tracks with a relaxed-fit shirt or a slim-fit T-shirt which flatters your well-worked-out beautiful body. For a party I will always go for a slim-fit shirt with a nice trouser and if you can bear the heat, then you could add a blazer. A plain white tee with a relaxed blue denim never goes out of style. For parties we can just wear a black shirt with a pair trousers to keep it simple yet stylish.
Who is your all-time fave style icon?
My all-time style icon from Bollywood is Ranveer Singh. He is spectacular. How did the shoot go?
It was a lot of fun. I have done a couple in New York  actually when I went to college there and have walked twice at fashion shows. It’s always been fun. Especially the lockdown was a very boring phase. So, it was exciting and unique. So, I enjoyed it.
So, you don’t get nervous?
I don’t get nervous but this is not something I do on a regular basis. So, it is different and a learning experience. I am not camera shy but I am not great at it. It takes a bit of work to figure out. Ratul and Komal were super nice. So, there was no pressure to get it right.
Everyone was super supportive.
You shot with a professional model. Did that help?
The good thing about shooting, acting or this is that it is very similar to a game. A lot of the stuff that we do in terms of our body language is like hiding certain things. So, if you are tired or scared, you should not show your opponent that. Especially in a sport like squash where you are literally stepping on your opponent and in that confined space, you do feed off the energy of your
opponent. He (Iqbal) kept guiding me through that. Every outfit had a different emotion. For me, the idea was that I am not a model... so I was natural. Most of the looks were smiling, which was easy for me to do. But it’s still awkward right if you are not used to reacting to a camera? I just have the tendency to get uptight may be while taking pictures.
The styles are different from what you normally wear...
I don’t usually wear these styles but at the age I am at, a lot of my friends are getting married. I have been attending a few weddings and have been exploring the bandhgala and traditional wear. I spend a lot of time in New York. So, the tuxedo is more my style. I was working in finance... so I would go to work in a suit. That’s more up my alley. I liked the bandhgala and the tux looks.
What do you like wearing most?
In Calcutta, you would find me in shorts the most. If I am going for a formal event, I’ll wear a suit. I don’t think I have an in-between.
Which sportsman dresses well?
Though his style won’t suit mine, but I find Hardik Pandya really stylish these days. ",culture
Colours and prints on toned-down silhouettes...," If you’re a fashion geek, enthusiast, aficionado or any sort of sartorial stake-holder at all, you would be gearing up for fashion week, red carpets, after-parties, guessing who showstoppers would be and dissecting each collection after, right about now. And this is true for all countries as September is fashion week season. But like everything else this year, global fashion weeks are also shifting to a mixed-media format of both physical and digital presentations with the latter outranking the former. Keeping in tune with the world that we are inhabiting, fashion has also toned down. It’s time we bid au revoir to maximalism and embrace minimalism in both pret and couture. So here’s our round-up of the highlights from the spring/summer 2021 fashion forecast from New York and London. 
  New York Fashion Week
With many big names giving this season a miss and many showcasing pret lines, New York Fashion Week (NYFW) did not last its usual week. However, the designers stepped it up to show the resilient spirit of New York City that was touted as the epicentre of the pandemic not long back. The line-up included names like Jason Wu, Tom Ford, Reem Acra and Christian Siriano. Wu opened proceedings with an outdoor show — one of the few — and a collection from his contemporary line paying homage to Tulum, Mexico, where he got married. Airy silhouettes, vibrant colours and separates marked the collection that was conceived as an optimistic dream of future travel. “I honestly wasn’t sure I could make a collection even if I felt inspired to do so…I felt that fashion should simply go into hibernation for a year,” said Tom Ford in his press note for the collection. Well, he did design a collection that comprised PJs, knits in the form of maxi dresses, leisure sets, bikinis and prints, kaftans, airy dresses and even animal print. Siriano presented a backyard show in Connecticut that had some semblance of reality and Billy Porter adding the oomph! Inspired by fantasy, the collection saw bikini tops and full ball skirts, frocks with exaggerated shoulders and patterned suits, paired with SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker heels and matching masks. 

Bibhu Mohapatra pays homage to Amrita Sher-Gil in his new collection
“To change, we must move, be it awkward, unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and (hopefully) enlightening” — Bibhu Mohapatra’s spring/summer 2021 collection drew inspiration from iconic artist Amrita Sher-Gil in the form of a film paying homage to her. The 2:40-second short film, for which Mohapatra has tapped New York-based film-maker and friend Shruti Ganguly and photographer JD Urban, will celebrate Amrita, as the designer digs deeper into culture through her lens. The 26-piece collection has custom-designed guipure lace, colourful tulle, Chantilly lace and silk canvas fabrics. Cotton day pieces have been added to denim looks with the “B” logo embroidered in Indian handiwork. Spring colours like chartreuse, lime, pink, nudes and different hues of blue are found in the collection. London Fashion Week
The second stop for September was London, which also followed the same mix of digital and physical shows. Erdem Moralioglu drew from history through a show that was aptly set in a forest with models dressed in prints, separates and puff-sleeved empire-waist gowns, the occasional cardigan and jacket and interestingly, denims peeking out from underneath some of these dresses. Victoria Beckham continues to design pieces that are an extension of her own style with tailored pieces for the modern woman with flared pants, layers, dresses playing peek-a-boo with a touch of sensuality, a pop of colours, a hint of casual but always very chic. Burberry presented performance art for their showcase as models emerged from the woods wearing Ricardo Tisci’s signature of elevating streetwear with tailoring in the brand’s beige, along with blues and blacks. The designer called the scene “a love affair between a mermaid and a shark, set against the ocean, then brought to land” and had clothes that were spring soft in their prints and motifs but held in good stead with knee-high boots, denims and jackets. Vivienne Westwood’s collection was launched in a video that starts with her protesting outside a
London court house against the extradition of Julian Assange and goes on to show her collection comprising her usual anti-establishment style and sustainability ethics. Stripes, patterns, prints, colours and mostly gender-neutral designs on “organic cotton, silk and linen; recycled polyester; mulesing-free wool; forest-positive viscose and acetate” form the crux of this collection.",culture
Experimenter’s ‘Do You Know How to Start a Fire’ for Art Basel’s OVR:2020...," Fraught with pestilence and political unrest, the year 2020 is set to remain etched in our collective psyche for posterity and Experimenter’s joint exhibition titled ‘Do you know how to start a fire’ for Art Basel’s OVR:2020 takes an artistic peek at this through the hands of Ayesha Sultana, Biraaj Dodiya, Prabhakar Pachpute and Rathin Barman.
Through OVR:2020, 100 Art Basel galleries from 28 countries are exhibiting works that are both made this year and resonate with the affairs of this year and city gallery Experimenter is also a part of this showcase. Pachpute incorporates personal experiences, research and folklore into a new series of oil paintings as he imagines “the future of a post-mined and post-industrial landscape”, while Dodiya’s paintings are “part funereal abstractions, part nocturnal landscapes” and are an extension of her process of applying, scraping off and re-applying layers of paint, as she examines themes such as mortality, youth, absence and discomfort.
Sultana, with her understanding of tempo, rhythm and movement, has created paintings drawn from her intense movements of making them and therefore focuses on the whole as opposed to the many singulars that a single work might comprise. Barman draws memories from the walls of decrepit mansions in north Calcutta to create sculptures out of scaffoldings akin to the thread that binds these structures and their inhabitants, often revealing deeper connections than one can imagine at first glance, in juxtaposition to the concrete, brass and iron he uses. Through this showcase, Experimenter throws up the possibility of taking a different look at our reality by reimagining what is as what could be.
Prateek Raja, director, Experimenter, who is also a part of the selection committee for this showcase by Art Basel, said “I am honoured to be on the selection committee for the Art Basel OVR:2020. Having been on the selection committee of the physical fair in Basel for the last four years, every year I look forward to our selection committee meetings. For me personally, there is an incredible amount of learning to be had as a committee member along with some of the most forward-thinking gallerists as colleagues. This committee is special in its own way since it’s for the OVR:2020 and what’s better than getting to see brilliant works by artists from all over the world all created in 2020, capturing this pivotal moment in time?” OVR:2020 is live till September 26 on www.artbasel.com/ovr.",culture
Pero goes '70s DISCO for their Fall/Winter 2020 collection," DISCO 2020, fashion label Pero’s fall/winter collection, is a party! It’s bright, shiny, stylish and happy! The collection was launched last week through a snazzy fashion film in collaboration with Lakme Fashion Week (LFW). The collection that is inspired by the urban nightlife scene of the ’70s and the subculture that it birthed, is contemporary, chic and all things Pero by way of how it’s made — Australian merino woven in Himachal Pradesh, cotton stripes and checks from Bengal, mashru stripes from Gujarat, handwoven silks from Bhagalpur, mulberry silks from south India and Chanderis from Madhya Pradesh. The collection also sees collaborations with artist and illustrator Nathalie Lete and ‘Grounds’, a Japanese shoe label. The film that launched the collection makes you want to groove as you forget your worries just for a little, therefore making the brand succeed in its intention of uniting people with carefree abandon.
“We are happy to collaborate with Pero for the launch of their fall-winter collection titled DISCO. This showcase is a glimpse of what is in store at the upcoming digital edition of Lakme Fashion Week where we once again push the boundaries of Indian fashion and look forward to future collaborations with Pero,” said Nikhita Punja Bhimjyani, head of fashion events, IMG Reliance, on this collaboration. Excerpts from a chat with designer Aneeth Arora:

Working on DISCO 2020
We usually start in advance since we showcase overseas and their cycle is different. So to be able to send them the fall/winter collection in January, we have to be ready by December. Because we make our own fabrics, which takes three-six months, we had to start in June last year. We took inspiration from ’70s retro disco and by January this year, we launched this in New York and in February, it was launched in Milan and in Paris after that. We were supposed to showcase this in March in India but that did not happen. However, when the lockdown lifted, we shot a film with this collection and decided to make it very happy to cheer people up. Launching it in collaboration with Lakme Fashion Week was a perfect opportunity and timing.

Moodboard for Pero’s fall/winter 2020
Our inspiration was the ’70s disco and so we looked at retro colours and stripes. We added a lot of glitter and shine by embroidering sequins on to them. But keeping to the philosophy of the brand, we did make our fabrics in India — the tartans that we wove were of the ’70s colour palette but they were done in Kullu and woven on the handlooms. We chose to use bright colours like tomato red, lilac and mint but we also kept a few subdued hues like grey and deep colours because we had to keep the global market in mind too.
The moodboard was mostly about these retro patterns, colours and a lot of shine and glitter. It’s not something we have done before and people must be wondering that it’s not Pero’s language but we have stayed true to our philosophy of handmade and craftsmanship. We have overlaid sequins on floral prints and it’s almost like rendering a fabric with sequins and hand-embroidery so we have rendered all the tartans we have woven with sequins. And it’s all done by zardosi, which is a very intricate needle technique.

‘Made in India’
We were already doing it so this was the time for us to take it to the next level. Looking at the buying patterns and what people were reacting to, we felt that it is a time when people want to own things that are special and heirloom pieces, instead of impulse buying. So we decided to take it a notch up by doing luxury, handmade pieces with a lot of attention to detail so that people value what they get and hold on to it for a longer time because it becomes close to their hearts. So that’s how we look at “Made in India” right now.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM International response to Indian craftsmanship
We have been in the global market for the past 10 years and every season, we have taken Indian textiles abroad. The response has always been overwhelming and they have always appreciated Indian textiles and skills. In fact, for the first few years when sustainability of Indian crafts wasn’t this big yet over here, it felt like they valued these things more than us because by then, we had seen it around us so much that it lacked novelty for us. Their appreciation gave us the confidence to work with Indian crafts over the years and they have also seen it evolve within the brand and therefore, their respect for Indian craftsmanship has only gone higher. I can see it in the way they appreciate the pieces and in the orders they place. Earlier, people had the notion that something coming from India had to be cheap because of cheap and abundant labour but now they know that handmade is luxurious and can’t be cheap.

Pero in and after 2020
Now is the time to stay strong and be positive because this is what will decide the future for us and so we are already working on our next collection. The current (international) season is quite in flux as we don’t know where we will be showcasing and how we will get those 300 people to come and see it. It is difficult to predict what will happen after this season so right now is the time to live in the moment and be positive, stay hopeful for things to become normal as soon as possible.
As a brand, we have known from the first day that people don’t expect run-of-the-mill things from us and we are striving to become more and more special in what we have to offer. In the future, our products will showcase the speciality of our crafts better and therefore show the love that has gone into those pieces. Hopefully, we would like to be a non-seasonal brand and make only special designs that go onto become heirloom pieces.",culture
Going back to the culinary roots with Chutney Day Celebrations," Suddenly, Chandu ki chacha is in demand for all the chutneys he had offered Chandu ki chachi! No, not kidding. Instagram is actually abuzz with a festive feel, as fervent notes are being exchanged on what chutneys to make and how. Yes, chutneys are in full focus this week, as food bloggers and food enthusiasts across India are geared up to celebrate Chutney Day on September 24. Move over pizza and cupcake days, it’s time to show some love to and feel proud of our desi delicacies.
Chutney Day is one of the 10 #IFOD or Indian Food Observation Day celebrations that started since 2016. The idea is to celebrate indigenous ingredients and dishes that are integral to Indian dining practices — from papads and wadis (boris for Bengalis) to chutney, chai pakoras and even aam achar! And it all began when culinary chronicler and F&B consultant Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal returned home after spending a day at a Macaroon Day event in Mumbai back in 2016. “In the evening when I was telling my husband about the event, he said how come you never celebrate any Indian food with so much zeal and enthusiasm? Around that same time we had this Good France Week, when French cuisine is celebrated across the globe. I also spotted #PakhalaDivasa trending on Twitter, which is a celebration of the Odiya version of fermented rice. All these made me think and finally inspired me to come up with the idea of doing Indian Food Observance Days. The first food day observed was the Aam Achar Day in April. Then in May, we celebrated Masala Day and Papad-Wadi Day, and so on. Now there are 10 different days celebrated and we kind of follow a seasonal calendar,” recalled Rushina, a popular name among Instagrammers for her lockdown Insta Live series Spice Chronicles.
Over the next four years, the idea has caught on with food lovers across social media. Calcutta-based food blogger and recipe curator Sayantani Mahapatra is all praise for an initiative like Chutney Day. “The diversity of food that we have in India is incredible. If you take just Bengal, you will be overwhelmed by the sheer variety of chutneys found across the state. From the coastal regions to Rarh Bangla or the areas around Chhotanagpur Plateau — you will find different recipes and formats of chutneys. It’s not just your tomato-aamshotto chutney or a raw mango chutney. I come from Midnapore and we have a kind of fish roe chutney that is delicious. A lot of people in Bengal are not even aware of these chutneys. Thanks to this Chutney Day, at least some people have known about our indigenous chutneys. Now this needs to move out of Instagram and become a household celebration. That way, more documentation, more conversations will happen around our own food,” says Sayantani.
According to Nalini Moti Sadhu, the chef-founder of Matamaal restaurant in New Delhi, popular for serving Kashmiri cuisine, chutneys are a very important part of Indian food. “Every household has their own chutney in India. Of course, it is a celebration of our regional cuisines and how each one of us respond to the ingredients available to us and make a delicious chutney out of them,” says Nalini, who hails from a Kashmiri Pandit family and makes the chutneys at her restaurant herself.  
“Chutneys might occupy a minuscule spot of real estate on the thali, but Indian meals would be incomplete without them,” writes Rushina in her Instagram post, announcing a series of Insta Lives featuring culinary experts from across India talking about chutneys from their regions. These punchy condiments span the spectrum of flavours — hot, sour, salty, sweet, bitter — and millions of combinations thereof.
They also come in a wide range of textures and colours.
For food historian and chef Shri Bala from Chennai, the moto behind Chutney Day is to celebrate the treasure trove of regional cuisines we have in India. “Chutney is a common name, but the variations found across the country are overwhelming. So many flavours, so many textures and taste…. Going back to the roots and tracing the roots — that is the basis for this celebration,” says Shri Bala.
Interestingly, this back-to-roots trend has gained a lot of steam during this Covid-induced lockdown, observes Rushina. “During the initial months of lockdown, most of us were forced to cook with very basic and limited supply of vegetables and other ingredients. What began as a necessity has given way to genuine interest and exploration of regional cuisines over the next few months. Today, people are actually taking pride in and showing off local food on their Instagram feed. And it’s a trend here to stay,” she explained.
The need to document regional and hyper-local cuisines and prevent the loss of traditional recipes with the loss of the elderly members of our families is also another major reason to promote desi food. Since most of Indian kitchen wisdom is passed on orally from one generation to the other, the age-old recipes stand a risk of getting forgotten if not documented properly. “We are celebrating Indian food days so that we don’t forget all the different variations of these food present across different regions,” says Kashmiri Barkakati Nath, an Assamese food promoter and consultant.
The celebration of Indian Food Days like a Chutney Day is also paving the way for making desi kitchen equipment cool. “Take the example of sil batta or the traditional mortar and pestle,” says Rushina. The message that there is nothing to be ashamed of our own kitchens has never been so clear and loud. It is not just a celebration of one dish. It is the celebration of Indian culture and culinary heritage, alongside the diversity of our nation. “After all, celebrating Chutney Day is a way of going back to our roots and deep-diving into our local cuisines to relive and revive lost recipes, and reconnect with our own food,” signs off Kashmiri.

“For us Kashmiris, just like Bengalis, we cannot compromise on our food. At lunch we discuss what’s for dinner. Back in Kashmir, apart from meat, the basic food used to be haak (greens) and rice. That’s very simple food. So, we needed something to lift that food up. And chutneys were the answer. My mother would go into the kitchen garden, pick up fresh mint and green chillies and make a last-minute chutney with rock salt in the mortar and pestle. Another all-time favourite was muli ki chutney — a mix of grated radish, a little curd and jeera, and sometimes a bit of walnut. If we had a full-fledged wazwan, with lots of mutton, then we would go for an onion chutney or Gundeh Chetin. And we also had walnut chutney, which was a bit expensive and hence made on special days,” recalls Nalini Moti Sadhu of Matamaal restaurant in New Delhi.

Down South
“In south India the curry leaves chutney is a very traditional one. Even in our Shradh rituals where we pray for our forefathers, we offer this curry leaves chutney… the cultural significance is so great. For us, chutneys are not just accompaniments, it sometimes becomes the main dish. For instance, we have Thovoyal, a chutney made of dal which we mix with rice and eat. We also use vegetable peels for chutneys, just like Bengalis do,” informed chef Shri Bala from Chennai.  

Northeast
“In Assam and Northeast India, we use chutneys made of herbs, fruits and berries that are available locally. So, these chutneys are very season-centric. Local herbs like man dhaniya or Burmese coriander and seeds like black sesame and perilla are often used for making chutneys. We also use a lot of mustard in our chutneys. Our meals are frugal, and chutneys are a way of making our meals tastier and appetising, enhancing the flavour profiles,” said home chef Kashmiri Barkakati Nath from Guwahati. Gujarat
“The Lasaniyo or Lasan ni Chutney is a favourite from the Kathiawadi kitchens of Gujarat. Chilli bombs, spice bombs, flavour bombs… they are all of that. With just garlic, red chillies, a smidgen of cumin and salt — this can be used in so many ways,” says culinary chronicler Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal.
Ingredients
1 cup garlic cloves
3tsp Kashmiri chilli powder for the colour and flavour (either store-bought, or whole dry chillies toasted and then ground at home)
3tsp Reshampati chilli powder or any chilli powder for the hotness
1tbsp oil
1tsp cumin seeds (toasted and ground)
1tsp salt (or to taste)
Method
Mix everything together and pound in a mortar and pestle till it turns into a rough dough-like paste. Make small balls and store in an air-tight container.",culture
A few books scheduled for 2021 that have us excited," Some of us have cancelled 2020 in our minds and become prone to imagining a time ‘when all of this is over’, effortlessly. Since the mind is already wandering into 2021, why not add a list of few more things that could make the journey slightly more eventful? Here is a list of 2021 book releases that has us staying hopeful.

Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro (Penguin Random House India):
Since having won the Nobel Prize, Kazuo Ishiguro is yet to give us a new book that would join the coveted list that holds iconic pieces of literature like Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go. However, come 2021, that changes as March 2 is when his next offering Klara and the Sun is set to release. Klara is an Artificial Friend stationed at a store from where she observes human beings around her, absorbing their emotions while hoping to be chosen by a customer. Being hailed as a testament to Ishiguro’s style, we can’t wait for this one.

100 Tales from the Puranas by Satyarth Nayak (Westland):
Satyarth Nayak has explored myriad genres in his previous books which include Sridevi’s memoir Sridevi: The Eternal Screen Goddess and a thriller The Emperor’s Riddles. Dabbling into Indian mythology this time, he promises to write stories from the Puranas that still find resonance in today’s time and impart the wisdom that can find relevance in our lives. Deep research has always been the base of Nayak’s books so one can hope that this time too, he will not disappoint.

Kobad Ghandy’s Memoir (Roli Books):
Marked an anti-national, with multiple stints in jail under the unjustified UAPA Act, Kobad Ghandy is a household name for his left-centric ideas and politics. What perhaps sets his journey apart is the privileged background that he hailed from, which he chose to forsake. Educated in Doon School and later in London, his encounter with racism led him on the path of Marxist politics in India where he returned and joined the Communist Party of India to lead the country on the path of radical ideas. He was released in October 2019 and has been penning his memoir since which is set to release in 2021.

Actually... I Met Them: A Memoir by Gulzar (Penguin Random House India):
Gulzar, one of the most prolific poet and lyricists of our times, has an illustrious career of having worked with the creme de la creme of the artiste fraternity. Dipping into his memories with these ‘gurus, friends and colleagues’, he shares anecdotes about his relationships forged over his love for words. This list includes names like Satyajit Ray, R.D. Burman, Kishore Kumar, Bimal Roy, Ritwik Ghatak, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Pandit Ravi Shankar, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Mahasweta Devi and Samaresh Basu to name a few. The book also promises to be filled with rare photographs and an inimitable sense of humour. 2021 is looking up already, we say!

The President’s Daughter by Bill Clinton and James Patterson (Penguin Random House India):

In 2018, we didn’t know this was a collaboration we needed, but after The President is Missing sold 3.2 million copies worldwide, and was touted as one of the most epic thrillers from the former president of the United States and one of the best crime writers of our generation James Patterson, a second book is definitely something to look forward to. Patterson’s inimitable writing style meets details only a President can know in this book that has new characters and a fresh plot. A former president has retired in New Hampshire where his daughter is suddenly kidnapped and that forms the crux of the upcoming novel that is set to release in June 2021.",culture
CIMA Art in Life: time to take the plunge," Art to artefacts, apparel to accessories, CIMA Gallery’s annual lifestyle exhibition -- Art in Life -- is a treasure trove for all those in love with the finer things in life. The month-long exhibition, that opened on September 21 at CIMA Gallery and Studio 21, features thoughtfully curated pieces from across the country -- saris by master weavers to handcrafted ethnic jewellery, handwoven dhurries to edgy designer-wear. This year, while following every pandemic protocol, the focus is on organic materials, fibres and weaves and colours. “We have a lot of tussars this year. They are light and wearable but with a rich and stylish look,” said Rakhi Sarkar, director, CIMA Gallery. One of the highlights of this segment are Koraput saris, traditionally woven in heavy cotton, but recreated in tussar for Art in Life. It isn’t just Odisha saris that one can look forward to, CIMA has worked with NGOs in the neighbouring state to curate ethnic jewellery with old, traditional designs. Art in Life is also joining hands with Sally Holkar, the founder of WomenWeave and integral to the revival of the Maheswar weave, to showcase some in silk and cotton. “We will work with her on an ongoing basis for our online collection, but for Art in Life we have a small collection of Maheswari saris. They are light and dressy and perfect for the festive occasion,” said Sarkar. Keep an eye out for the mix of stylish and quirky, unique and edgy that young designers like Abhishek Dutta, Parama Ghosh, Paromita Banerjee, Rimi Nayak and Sneha Arora add to the exhibition with their line of clothes. “We have a lot of handwoven linen Western and Indo-Western wear for both men and women. They have an interesting look and they are eco-friendly,” said Abhishek Dutta, whose collection, Parole, being showcased is a sustainable brand created by the inmates of correctional homes. “Our target group is young men and women and we have a variety of silhouettes to choose from. There are some quirky signature prints as well. It is relaxed clothing which is perfect for a staycation but can be transformed into party wear with the right accessories,” said Dutta, who is showing at Art in Life for the first time. And yes, this collection is also affordable. “CIMA Art in Life was a perfect fit for a collection that talks about freedom of attitude,” added Dutta. Parama Ghosh has made an exclusive collection of handwoven jamdani blouses this year for Art in Life in which she has used lace, hand-embroidery and the shabeki borders. Ghosh will have her usual Puja-themed collection as well, from the Kumartuli map on the sari to the Durga face on the blouse. “With social distancing affecting tailoring, ready-made blouses will make a lot of difference to festive buyers. Art in Life has so many beautiful saris, and they can have the option of picking up blouses to match those as well,” said Ghosh. Handmade scarves and dupattas, bags and batuas will up your fashion game, as will the three-layered handmade protective masks made by NGOs as you mingle during the festive season. Men can choose from a range of silk shirts and kurtas.

Meet two musicians who have ventured beyond their professions," Besides music, underground music producer Shiladitya Bose, aka Mr Bose (also Shila), has a soft corner for puppers. The Cuddles Collective — started by the artiste and his girlfriend Sevina Kahlon on July 5 (his birthday) — takes care of pet dogs and stray ones as well. “We can afford to give love to our pets, so why not the ones on the street?” says Mr Bose.

Man on a mission
The Cuddles Collective runs monthly packages for the maintenance of pet dogs, which includes obedience training, vaccination, grooming, health and sanitation at the the doggo’s home. “Rather than going to parlours to get their nails and grooming done, we provide the service in their comfortable environment,” he says. The profits that Shila receives from the packages go towards feeding dogs on the streets.

How it started
Mr Bose had busy weekends while playing at nightclubs before the lockdown. On a December night, while driving back home from a gig, he noticed a puppy trying to cross the road. He then stopped his car, picked up the puppy and gave it to a shelter to be taken care of. Unfortunately, the puppy passed away as the shelter failed to take care of it, which became a turning point for the musician. “I realised that you can’t trust anyone with a life, so I chose to do whatever little I can.”

Getting in touch
ADVERTISING
Ads by Teads
To get started, a dog parent must get in touch with The Cuddles Collective on Instagram or Facebook and mention their needs and location of stay. Two employees — working with Mr Bose and Sevina — then reach the designated location and provide your little buddy with premium grooming, basic consultation, dog exercise, dog training, dog psychology, dog physiotherapy, diet planning and vaccination tracking. Besides these packages The Cuddles Collective employees know how to handle aggression in dogs. “One of my employees also has a therapy dog that spends time with elderly people and young kids with special needs,” he said. Although they don’t do adoptions they are willing to lend a hand to little buddies to find a safe home.

Scooby Snack
While providing services to the doggos, The Cuddles Collective has also collaborated with Sugarbaby Dessert Co. (run by Marium Javed) to provide delicious treats for your little buddies. A box of four cupcakes  — or should we say pupcake! — (Rs 300), which all dogs “really love”, is full of nutrients necessary for your dog. The ingredients? Chicken, peanuts, chickpea flour, whole wheat flour, chia seeds, carrots, pumpkin, banana, olive oil and organic honey. What else does a woofer want?
Safety measures
With the global pandemic running for months now, Mr Bose has taken safety measures to keep the doggies and their parents safe. Before starting work for the day Mr Bose ensures that all his employees are sanitised, wear a mask and their body temperatures get recorded. Before entering and exiting any household the employees are asked to sanitise.

How can we help
Mr Bose has made it very clear that they don’t want any donations. The Cuddles Collective prefers pictures of dogs being fed or even food and collars for the stray. “Helping in kind and creating awareness is what we appreciate the most,” he said. Mr Bose also recommends feeding dogs on the road and checking to see if they are vaccinated.

The road ahead
“I want to change the perception of people not wanting to keep stray dogs,” he said. Calcutta-based singer Tanya Sen has turned her secret talent into a new venture. At the beginning of September, she launched her new project — NYNE by Tanya Sen, a one-stop solution for interior decoration. Not only does she help with end-to-end styling but also works around existing furniture and fabrics.“They have everything they need and I make it look a particular way by revamping and styling a room,” she said.

Passion-driven
Although singing is her constant, interior designing is something that has always been at the back of her mind for the past two years. “Being creative-oriented, I am used to work being enjoyable, otherwise it’s difficult to get into something,” she said. After the pandemic hit, Tanya took this as a golden opportunity to reinvent the wheel and start things differently. “This is the time.” Tanya focuses on designs and styles, ranging from economy and premium to luxe.

First step
On getting in touch with Tanya through her website or Instagram account, a meeting is scheduled to understand what the client wants. She takes into consideration the colours, interests, favourite movies, music and more when curating a space. “They can also show me an image of what they want and I can work with it,” she said. After exchanging ideas she proceeds to design a mood board, which after approval is turned into a 3D model, so clients get an in-depth understanding of the space. After this, it’s time to get the work done.
To help her with her venture, Tanya is bringing together a team of architects for a wider range of ideas and services.

The response
Before starting this new project Tanya already revamped three of her homes. “A few people wrote to me saying they like my aesthetics, so we had a meeting with them and my second project is for a friend of mine,” she said. With new projects flowing in Tanya decided to make a service out of it and she will soon use tools of marketing and advertising.

A goal from childhood
Tanya has a flair for interior designing; it’s something she has seen while growing up. Her father is an interior designer and started his journey much later in life. It was from family vacations around 2005 when Tanya’s love for interior designing started. “It was something I grew up with, at a time when there weren’t many furniture stores and everything was handmade.” She became a huge fan of Scandinavian designs after visiting the country and going to a factory was a part of her itinerary when she visited Denmark. “It’s been a constant in my life and it’s time to take it forward.”

Learning from experience
It is the history of interior designing and experiences that moulded the talent in Tanya. “I am looking into everything, from software packages that develop 3D designs to other technicalities as well,” she said.",culture
Smart-cooking hacks," Cooking is not a chore — it is an activity to enjoy and, sometimes, can be rather therapeutic! I learnt this only a few years ago and now I strive to share this attitude with all of you. I grew up in Calcutta at a time when kids and youngsters were not encouraged to be in the kitchen and preparing daily meals was the job of the proud and dedicated ‘cook’ under the stern guidance of the ladies of the house. In other words, it was a serious job to be done and gotten over with!
Later, during my work trips to Italy and after watching endless episodes of MasterChef Australia and Nigella Lawson shows on TV, my attitude to cooking changed. I was amazed at how one could actually enjoy the whole process of creating something and then savouring every bite of their labour. With my Italian husband and his family, I learnt how preparing a weekend meal could be a social family activity where everyone was equally involved and the time spent in the kitchen with some wine and music was as joyful as the time spent on the table enjoying that meal!
However, life is super busy for everyone and as working women, we have to juggle it all… and that just quadrupled in 2020 thanks to corona. After becoming a mum, my focus has been on making healthy and nutritious family meals quickly but creatively. Smart cooking is the need of the hour and this is exactly the mantra in my book, Fast Fresh Flavourful, which so many of you have been enjoying. Believe me, with these simple hacks, you will be more efficient in the kitchen and your food will shine without you looking like a hot mess! If I can do it all with a smile, so can you.
Planning is the key. Plan your meals on a weekly or daily basis based on the likes and dislikes of the family, aiming to include at least one element from every food group. Think colours and variety in flavour and texture. If you wait till 6pm to decide “what should I cook for dinner”, it will definitely be a moment of panic!
  Do your grocery shopping on the weekend for the week ahead, stocking up on fresh and dry ingredients you usually use in your favourite dishes. Then follow the first-in-first-out stock system substituting recipes with ingredients that are handy.
  Use the weekend to make batches of chutneys, sauces, marinades, curry bases, masalas which can be refrigerated and used over the next few days.
  One dish can suit all! Make a big batch of the basic dish, separate some for the kids and spice up the rest for the adults. This is my secret to getting kids to enjoy food and avoiding that tantrum at meal times. The kids will feel grown up eating the same food as the adults together on the table. Ditch that kiddy crockery as well.
Stock up on good cooking equipment to make your life easy and feel like a pro chef. Invest in a good set of knives and a heavy wooden board for smooth, easy chopping. Get a good set of pots and pans and baking equipment.
  Cut your veggies the evening before for your meal the next day and store in ziplock bags in the fridge. Wash the bags, air-dry inside-out and reuse. Store fresh herbs in ziplock bags or wrap in cloth bags and keep neatly in the fridge. Put wilted herbs in water and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes before using and they will be bright and crisp.
  Freeze nuts, seeds and breadcrumbs to add extra crunch and prevent them from going rancid just when you need them to finish that salad. Use directly from the freezer. Make extra curries, sauces and purees and freeze in ice cube trays, defrosting only what you need per meal.
  Fresh chicken and seafood can also be frozen so you have it on hand when needed and save yourself the last-minute trip to the local market. Make sure you defrost ahead of time. I freeze burger buns and pizza bases so that they are handy for a last-minute meal when nothing else makes sense!
Blend 200g-300g of ginger and garlic separately in a blender and store in an airtight glass jar in the fridge for up to two weeks. Avoid the hassle of chopping and grating these basic aromatics before every meal. To peel garlic cloves easily, soak them in water for 30 minutes and then peel.
Give yourself an hour in the day to cook for two meals at least. With some planning and prep, this is very easily achievable. Cook extra of each dish and use the leftovers the next day with some variation — aloo-gobi sandwiches with some fresh greens make a great office lunch. Leftover noodles, rice and stir fries can be combined into a healthy Buddha bowl the next day.
Extra chicken tikka kebabs are delicious wrapped in a roti with some salad and a simple drizzle of salted dahi and chilli sauce or even dunked in a simple tomato-based gravy the next day. Soups make excellent pasta sauces and freeze very well so always make extra. That coconut prawn curry which you had with rice last night could make an interesting noodle bowl with some fresh herbs, chillies and lime.
Prepare ingredients beforehand. For plant-based proteins and grains, plan and soak the night before so you have plenty of choice for the next day. Marinate and salt meat up to 12 hours before and refrigerate. When you are tired after a long day at work, all you have to do is cook it as you like. This also adds bags of flavour.
  Use the oven as much as possible to roast your meats, veggies, potatoes and so on. Use the time and energy to catch up with the kids homework instead of hovering around the stove.
Taste, taste, taste and make adjustments according to your palate. Recipes are only guidelines for you to combine with your personal touch and creativity.
If you found this useful, you can get lots of effortless yet healthy recipes using fresh local produce in my book Fast Fresh Flavourful available on Amazon worldwide.

Master storyteller Ken Follett on his sensational new prequel to the Kingsbridge series," A dramatically-shot video with an upright Ken Follett striding through cathedrals of humbling sizes, speaking about his latest offering The Evening and The Morning (Pan Macmillan India), welcomed some 40-odd journalists from around the world at a live session with the author over Zoom. In 1989, Follett had taken a sharp detour from his usual best-selling, spy-thriller genre, launching The Pillars of the Earth set in the 12th century civil war in England, famously known as the Anarchy and thus was born the Kingsbridge series, split over a largely unequal gaps of time, which has sold millions of copies worldwide. 2007 was the year of the first sequel World Without End, set 150 years later in the same town of Kingsbridge where a gothic cathedral has been already been built but the world faces the clash of progressive ideas versus traditions, while the gruesome pandemic called Black Death engulfs the world. A decade later came A Column of Fire set in 1558 and now, adding to this series in 2020, is a prequel The Evening and The Morning.
“It is the end of the dark ages and the beginning of the Middle Ages…” begins the video, accompanied with some eerie background music, “...and this is the point when England begins to change,” we hear. The time is 997 CE and England is being attacked by Welsh and the Vikings, when three separate lives and their encounters form the crux of this historically-rich novel that is seeing light of day in various languages around the world this month. “The question we authors most get asked is where do we get our ideas from and most authors get quite bored with the answers and end up making silly answers like ‘I get one at the supermarket.’ But it’s not really a bad question because readers often come up with ideas to us saying, ‘Here’s an idea that I think you ought to write a book about.’ They end up telling us about some dramatic incident in their life. And the idea is never any good and here is the reason why. Because a novel is told through some 5,200 dramatic scenes and a good idea must have that number of dramatic scenes. So the one or two that you can find in the idea suggested by readers, is nowhere near enough,” began the jovial author Follett, dressed in an impeccable white suit with his signature mop of white hair, sitting in front of a vast library, oozing erudition every minute.

THE INCEPTION
There were two such ideas from where was born this prequel — this particular moment of the end of Dark Ages and the beginning of the Middle Ages which can well be seen as the rebirth of European civilisation, “which was dead or dying for about a 1000 years”, he adds. “This was also the time three powerful groups were fighting for power, the Anglo-saxons, the Vikings or displaced Scandinavians who were pirates and slave traders who treated England like a shop for hundreds of years, and finally the Normans, across the channel in Southern France, who I feel were the most sophisticated lot of Western Europe,” said Follett.
The author believed that the power struggle between three such distinctly different groups would generate lots of stories. Acknowledging the fan base formed of the town of Kingsbridge which has appeared every time in this series, he wanted to explore what the town was like before it became an area of grave significance. He has witnessed the town go from nothing to having a cathedral and a marketplace, vibrant with prosperity.
“Any journey of progress is always mired in conflict. There will always be those who believe we need a bigger marketplace and a larger cathedral while some will believe we are good as we are,” he said of the various conflicts. So it was only natural to be curious about the origins of this town that now even boasts of its own website! It was the coming together of these two thoughts that gave us this prequel in 2020.

THE PROCESS

Powered By PLAYSTREAM
The first day that the author sits down to pen a book, he writes about three paragraphs, he tells us which sum up what he is going to write about. On the second day, he takes a look at what happened before and what happened afterwards, while also questioning and addressing the origins of the people in the book. “By the end of the second day, I have got a whole page!” He laughingly adds. Repeated questioning of self is the only way the story grows by itself. In his quest for one dramatic scene after the other, pages fill up organically as he declares, “If it’s not dramatic, it’s not a scene! If it’s not a scene, its a description and a rather tedious one!”
He needs his readers to exclaim in every scene, ‘Oh my god! Now what will happen? How will he get out of this situation’ and this nonchalant admittance of his need for constant and vigilant attention of his readers, spoke volumes of the old man’s success.

THE RESEARCH
People having dinner, people chopping down trees and walking their dogs, at a certain point in history, are the kind of details that the author likes to delve into when it comes to research for his books. “I spend a year preparing and researching and the video has brief glimpses of the places I went to for my research. Like the Bayeux Museum in Normandy and their tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England, but it also gives a glimpse of the everyday lives of the 11th century.” The linen tapestry with embroidered details is a part of the Bayeux Tapestry museum, which forms one-third of the Bayeux Museum with the other two being Memorial Museum of The Battle of Normandy and Baron Gerard Museum if Art and History. The richness of the details should suffice your research, the author suggests and for the little bits that don’t, you can always make it up, is the jovial author’s response! In an effort to highlight a particular instance, he speaks of the time when in dire need of information on the kind of underwear worn in the Dark Ages, leaving behind failed efforts of his expert consultants (“If they don’t know they answer, nobody knows the answer!”) he decided to “make something up”. We felt like we had been gently let on to the secret and we weren’t secretly giggling at all.

THE FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT
Drawing upon a connection between his books, he wonders how each book has people fighting for some kind of freedom. A Column of Fire was about religious freedom, while he has also written about suffragettes and civil rights movement of the ’60s. It’s a theme he likes because the conflict of the characters are not bound by a merely selfish wall and is indeed for a greater cause with a high-minded purpose. His latest is a fight for justice which was difficult to find in the Dark Ages when rulers favoured their kin.
Follett has largely explored this in the latest book and is of the firm belief that the Rule of Law which says that the state of governed not by the ruler but by the law, was deeply lacking then. “The reason that finds resonance with the current times is that it is being contested now. Something we all thought we had put to rest years before! There were perhaps some medieval kings who were above the law but no one since. And yet now we have governments around the world questioning the rule of law,” he said. The author doesn’t mince words names countries like his own UK and Poland and leaders like Trump, and believes it is an issue today. He may not want to purposely include a message for the readers in his books but one seems to emerge from this one, something the author could have never imagined, as he admits in his own words.
A novel unwittingly relevant to its times, Follett manages to touch upon slavery and feminism thereby capturing the zeitgeist of the present times. The pandemic that we find ourselves a part of, feels similar to the injustice of the Dark ages on our millennial skin and sensitive conscience. The Evenings and The Morning definitely promises to be a treat from the master storyteller.",culture
Master of the Dahlniverse," In the canon of children’s literature written in English, Roald Dahl’s inventive writing has the ability to transport readers instantly to a child’s world with the sheer magic of his imagination. But that world is not full of fairies, princes, princesses, or friendly dwarfs. Rather, often, it gives us a glimpse of a murky world, where children have difficult lives, and adults have evil intentions. And through their struggles, the children learn valuable lessons. The cosmos Dahl has created is fair — here the good get their rewards and the greedy their punishment. However, that is interspersed with various comic elements, interesting characters, varied and imaginative landscapes, and eye-popping dishes. So, it is hardly gloomy despite being dark. The appeal of visualising Dahl’s stories has led to many cinematic adaptations too that further feed our imagination. On the author’s birthday, we revisit his works and traverse his imagined universes that gave us thrilling adventures and unpredictably wacky and unco endings.

The fascinating kids
Dahl’s child characters have always left us fascinated— be it their superhuman qualities and mischief-making tendencies, their courageous and innocent attempts to get rid of a troubling situation, their intemperate attitude or their lovable and benign nature. His child characters remain etched in our hearts and set examples of both the good and the bad. Here are some of our favourites.

Matilda, Matilda
Matilda Wormwood is an intelligent girl. Her knowledge of literature, maths and ability to compose limericks only at the age of four or five makes her an extraordinarily genius kid. Her school teacher Miss Honey is very fond of her. However, she has a difficult childhood at home with unappreciative parents, who don’t care much about her abilities. A mischievous little girl and a child prodigy, Matilda is the fittest person to take on the abusive headmistress of her school, Miss Agatha Trunchbull. Using her magical telekinetic powers, Matilda haunts Trunchbull with his step-brother-in-law Magnus Honey’s ghost. She also saves her teacher Miss Honey from her problems using her magical powers, who later takes care of her by giving her the family life she deserved.

Charlie Bucket, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Hailing from a humble background, Charlie’s life changes forever when he finds a golden ticket to visit a certain Willy Wonka’s famous chocolate factory. Throughout the story, he sets an example of a boy who is good at heart, honest and extremely humble in contrast to the other children in the story, who are punished for their greed. For being an ideal child from the beginning to the end throughout the tour with Willy Wonka and his grandfather, he is rewarded at the end as Mr Wonka’s successor of the chocolate factory. Charlie has in fact been one of Dahl’s most loved child characters.

George, George’s Marvellous Medicine
Eight-year-old George’s grandmother dislikes him and is a villainous character. She terrifies little George with all kinds of scary stories and bullies him too. One day, George decides to cure his grandma’s habit and take revenge on her by preparing her a ‘magic medicine’. With many interesting ingredients, George prepares this medicine for his grandma. What makes him an extraordinary kid is his brave step to come out of his own troubled situation despite his age. It is amusing how George’s potion affects his grandmother’s shape and eventually, the old lady vanishes too. Later, on his father’s insistence, he gives his unique potion to farm animals too to increase their size.

Unnamed narrator, The Witches
The unnamed narrator in this widely popular and criticised story by Dahl becomes a victim of the witches’ wicked plan to turn kids into mice and get them abandoned from their homes. Even though his grandma teaches him every detail of spotting witches, he falls into their trap. But his grandma continues to take care of him even after he is turned into a mouse. Finally, by mixing the same Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-maker in the green pea soup, he becomes successful in defeating the witches by turning them into mice. His bravery saves the life of uncountable children from falling trap to the witches’ plan. However, he is unable to transform into a human till the very end. His love for his grandmother knows no bounds, and instead of grieving his predicament, our hero feels elated as a mouse’s life span is much shorter than the human life span and he would not have to live in this world without his grandma.

Danny, Danny the Champion of the World
He is a smart and brave child who turns out to be a true champion by the end of the story. He lives an adventurous life with his father in a caravan placed beside his father’s workplace — the filling station and shares a great bond with him too. Danny has a tough time in school because of his headmaster, who is sort of a Trunchbull. He loves listening to bedtime stories from his father like most children do but also helps his father in poaching inside Victor Hazell’s forest. Danny gives his father new ideas to catch pheasants and also saves him from the vile forest owner Victor Hazell’s trap using his quick-thinking abilities. The exotic food
The author’s use of food as a metaphor for life oftentimes proves to be a culinaire’s dream. His fictitious drinks and dishes across his stories have always enticed readers. Though some sound extremely repugnant, they are nonetheless innovative and regaled us as kids. Here are some of our edible favourites from Dahl’s menu:

Whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
A ‘light-brown, creamy-coloured chocolate bar’ that contained hidden, golden tickets, gave Charlie and other kids the opportunity to tour Wonka’s factory. As readers, most of us have wished to take this tour and taste those amazing candies and chocolates! In Dahl’s book Revolting Recipes, this chocolate is prepared with marshmallows, double cream, dark chocolate, Cadbury crunchie and ice cream as main ingredients. We can now understand why Grandpa George said it is the best chocolate bar from Willy Wonka’s factory.
Frobscottle, The BFG
In the giant country food choices are obnoxious. From human beings to the abominable Snozzcumbers, the only available vegetable. However, in the land of no water, there is only one drink available and that sounds appetising for readers — Frobscottle. It is a sweet and refreshing pale green liquid that is fizzy and has bubbles. The bubbles in this drink strangely go downwards. Adding to the amusement of the children, one who drinks it farts instead of burping after having fizzy drinks, as the bubbles go downward in the tummy. Going by how Sophie describes the drink, “Tasted of vanilla and cream with just the faintest taste of raspberries on the edge of the flavour”, who wouldn’t want to taste this wonder!
Ice cream with chips of crisp burnt toffee, Boy: Tales of Childhood
Dahl, from his summer holidays spent in Norway, particularly reminisced about an ice cream served after a fish meal. He describes it as the creamiest ice cream and its flavour as “unforgettable”. The ice cream had numerous pieces of “crisp burnt toffee” and it was nothing sort of an ordinary ice cream that melts easily in the mouth. Those crunchy pieces were meant to be chewed and its taste would linger long after. With such a detailed description, any ice cream lover’s heart would crave to taste it.
Giant Wangdoodles from Australia, The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me
This is what dreams are made of for chocolate lovers. In this story, Billy, who opens his own candy shop, wishes to keep confections from all over the world at his shop. For two weeks, different boxes from various countries arrive and he samples them carefully. He particularly mentions a type of chocolate named the Giant Wangdoodles from Australia. It has a crispy chocolate crust and is centre-filled with a huge ripe red strawberry. Who could possibly resist such a combination?!
Pishlets, The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me
On the grand opening day of his store, Billy had special sweets to offer everyone — the Duke, the giraffe, the monkey. This interesting variety of sweets called Pishlets would allow anyone to sing like a nightingale. Specially bought by children who want to whistle in the street but can’t, Billy gives this to the Pelican, who doesn’t belong to the songbird variety. But after chewing it into his beak he could start signing sweet melodies. This dish is an example of how Dahl never fails to give wings to his reader’s imagination. The scariest villains
Dahl’s superpowers and versatility in creating villainous characters have been discussed time and again. His villains aren’t always eerie monsters creeping out in the dark, nor are they unworldly. They are often ordinary people who we grow up around, or are garbed in disguise. Sometimes they are familiar animals with cannibalistic desires. It is our familiarity with such characters in the real world that make them appear even more scary. Today, we remember a few of his best (read: scariest) villains!

Miss Agatha Trunchbull, Matilda
In Dahl’s popular book Matilda, the protagonist’s headmistress at Crunchem Hall Primary School is unlike the strict headmistresses who scold us to discipline us, that we come across as children.
She is very unlike Willy Wonka from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, who tried to teach kids important life lessons through his punishments. Miss Trunchbull is a sadist who takes pleasure in terrorising kids and embodies living hell. The extraordinarily large woman is a power-hungry monster who can’t stand pigtails. She holds children by their braids and swings them over the fence, tosses them out of windows and locks them up in a cupboard filled with glass pieces and nails called The Chokey. She is abusive and uses extremely violent methods to discipline kids. She also considers herself God in the classroom.

The Grand High Witch, The Witches
The witches in Dahl’s book hardly fit the image of a witch in our minds — black cloak-clad strange beings with scaly skin and menacing laughs. They roam around the streets of England in disguise as ordinary elegant ladies in gloves, shoes and wigs and are hard to recognise. But the scariest of them is the Grand High Witch — the group leader. She cannot tolerate children and wants to get rid of all of them from England and the world because she thinks they are ‘revolting’, ‘foul’ and ‘filthy’. She plots to turn kids into mice with Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker and instructs all witches to sell sweets and chocolates infused with this potion to kids, expecting their parents and teachers to kill them with mousetraps! She has a scary gaze and not an ounce of mercy for any kid she dislikes. She is also extremely mean to her fellow witches and no one dare speak an extra word to her or question her.

Boggis, Bunce and Bean, Fantastic Mr Fox
The mean trio of farmers is vengeful and runs individual businesses of ducks, chicken, turkeys and other things. Irked about a certain Mr Fox stealing their livestock, they get after his life. The farmers trap him and his family and kids underground along with other creatures and make them starve. Though their villainous qualities are reactions to provocation, yet their tenacity in making Mr Fox’s life difficult make them extremely despicable. However, eventually, Mr Fox comes up with a masterplan to save the animals from starving to death and keeps the trio waiting for him.

Mr and Mrs Twit, The Twits
Mr Twit is presentably scary enough with his unkempt beard displaying food particles. However, what makes him a villain in Dahl’s book is not his look, but his cruelty towards animals and intolerance towards kids. His wife is the glass-eyed Mrs Twit. Both of them take pleasure in harming animals. They trap birds for food and torture their pet monkeys by making them stand on their hands and heads. Being intolerant towards children, they trap them in a bird-catcher too. As a couple, they play nasty pranks on each other and are disgusting as a pair of villains. In the end, the Twits get their deserved punishment from the monkeys and the birds.

Enormous Crocodile, The Enormous Crocodile
In this story, the Enormous Crocodile with long nails and scaly skin has a gluttonous appetite and expresses his horrific desire to feast on children. He tries various tricks like disguising himself as a coconut tree or children’s rides in parks in order to get closer to kids. However, his plans are ruined by fellow animals. The other forest animals keep the children aware to save them from the Enormous Crocodile. A terrifying presence in the animal world, he is finally thrown away at the end by Trunky the elephant from the swamp.",culture
Bruising for battle," The compact SUV segment is gradually turning out to be the preferred class of cars for those who aspire to own one. There is still some distance to go to catch up with the premium hatchback plus entry-level sedan category, but it is possibly going to dethrone them soon enough.
Not surprisingly, carmakers across the board either have a product in that segment already or are planning to roll out one soon. And Kia Motors, which has been selling cars in India for a year now, is trying to shake things up and pull in the buyer with its contender here, the Kia Sonet.
Like the Seltos before it, Kia is selling the Sonet in an almost bewildering range of engine and gearbox configurations — there are three engines, four if one considers the different states of tune of the diesel as two, as one probably should, and no less than five gearboxes.
The Telegraph drove the top-end automatic versions in GT Line trim in both petrol and diesel that were made available by Celica Kia, which has showrooms in Sector V, Salt Lake, and Howrah. While the details were out already, this is the first time we got a feel of the SUV. Here’s our take.

The Exteriors
Our first reaction when we saw the Sonet was that it looks good. Kia has made it nice and chunky with fender flares and bonnet bulges giving it that stocky, muscular look. The ones we drove came with nicely designed 16-inch alloys that filled out the wheel wells. The treatment of the corporate ‘tiger nose’ grille is nice too, with partial chrome surround that sort of links with the daytime running lights to create bright element that goes right across the front. The GT Line has red inserts in the bumpers, along the flanks, in the grille, as well as red brake calipers for the front wheels. The headlamps are LED and the design of this cluster is mimicked by those of the tail lights. Overall, there are lots of horizontal visual cues that make the Sonet look broad and planted. An interesting touch is the treatment of C-pillar section. The tilted-back look and a section going across the roof is reminiscent of pricey boats. We like.

The Interiors
The moment we opened the doors we thought we had seen these interiors before. And we sort of have. Inside, the Sonet GT Line looks a lot like the bigger Seltos. The dashboard with the upright 10.25-inch multifunction touchscreen and the instrument cluster, the black seats with red stitching that seem to have come out of a sportscar, the door pads with the red stitching again, the sun roof, the flat-bottomed multifunction steering wheel with the prominent GT Line across the bottom, the gearshift lever, we’ve seen all of them in the Seltos. And now they are here. So the Sonet feels like a notch up.
Then there are the ventilated front seats that can keep the shirt from sticking to your back in summer. The driver’s seat is height adjustable. The seats, both front and rear, are well-contoured and position is good. Rear legroom is adequate for average Indians and could only get a bit tight if there are six-footers both front and back. The 392-litre boot has no major intrusions and could take a fair bit of luggage.
This model is well-equipped with a wireless phone-charging pad in the front console along with USB sockets front and rear and a 12V socket up front. The air purifier now has additional virus protection.
There are thoughtful bits like a dedicated umbrella holder in the front door that will drain the water, a slot for the phone between the cup holders and next to the charging socket at the back, pockets to fit phones behind the front seats and such-like touches. The top-end model gets a Bose seven-speaker music system that is pretty darn good. The overall fit and finish of the interiors is very good quality and really difficult to fault.

The engines and gearboxes
We experienced two engine-gearbox combos — the 1-litre turbocharged petrol mated to the seven-speed DCT automatic and the 1.5-litre diesel paired with a six-speed torque convertor automatic.
The petrol runs really quiet was the first thing we noticed. One almost doesn’t hear it at all during normal city driving. The gears are well matched and it is very smooth and unobtrusive when given progressive throttle inputs, which is what driving is about most of the time in cities. Knowing it is a small, turbocharged petrol, we felt a pathological need to mash the accelerator down and zap the setup. As expected, there is a turbo lag and some engine gruffness at higher revs. This is not its natural habitat.
To squeeze the most out of this engine, shift into manual mode. The  Sonet doesn’t try to override your gear selection unless it senses that the engine might stall. This is the way to do some spirited driving. But fuel efficiency will surely take a big hit if you do this.
To check all the boxes, the diesel is what you need. The engine in the top variant is in the same state of tune as it is in the Seltos. So power output is 115ps, 15 more than in the lower versions. Now this is punchy. The sound deadening is excellent and most of the diesel clatter has been kept out of the passenger space. With peak torque coming in from a fairly low 1,500rpm, the gearbox has been configured in such a way that it stays in the power band most of the time and response to throttle inputs is immediate. This is a more relaxed setup to have.
The ride and handling
Visually, the Sonet seems to have pretty good ground clearance. So, one tends to expect it to roll and pitch. We were happy to note that there isn’t much of either. In fact, in the diesel, we had to do a sudden avoidance manoeuvre to save some literally ‘low-level wildlife’ that had strayed onto the road, and the Sonet was entirely unflustered through it and handled nice and true. No surprises there. On a few broken patches there wasn’t a great deal filtering into the cabin.
The suspension setup is something that Indian car makers seem to have mastered and Kia is no exception. So it eats up the roughs very well and doesn’t get skittish even carrying some speed over them. Overall, refinement is very good. The Sonet also has traction control with Snow, Mud and Sand modes, but we didn’t get to test any of it. There are also Eco, Normal and Sport modes. Normal is good for most situations.

The decision
As far as the vehicle is concerned, the top model that we drove was desirable and has a lot of segment firsts like diesel with a torque convertor automatic, ventilated seats, Bose music system, and so on. So if one wants those features in a car with a small footprint, this is a natural choice. However, we would get to know the prices this week although our guess is they will start around Rs 6.5 lakh. The top variants should go to around Rs 12 lakh is our guess. If that is so, unless one specifically wants a bigger vehicle, the Sonet would do the job very well.

Reviewing two sharply carved commentaries on contemporary India...," (Context; Rs 699)
Rarely does one come upon a non-fiction book so fascinating in its very premise that the reading experience is akin to playing join-the-dots with lived experiences. Muscular India proved to be just that as it presents a decade-long study of the emerging Indian middle class through the lens of fitness trainers in urban settings, found abundantly in gyms, who use their body as a currency to social mobility. Written in an engaging language and steady pace without an overwhelming sense of facts and numbers, Baas’s anthropological background shines through his nuanced approach with his interviewees who trust him enough to allow him rare glimpses of proudly-guarded inner pangs of ambition and truth. Understanding the middle class has never been so excitingly familiar before!
Delving deep into the emergence of the Indian middle class, Baas writes about the sharp divide between “upper middle class” and “lower middle class” and the sharp demarcations in between allowing for a scope of mobility. These personal trainers who build muscles and bodies that demand trust in health-building from any observer, maybe interacting in close proximity with those who hail from the supposed ‘other side’ but the class divide is apparent and the struggle to move from one to the other is a slow, arduous journey.
Speaking to young men from metros like Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore, the author cleverly marks out three sharply defining moments in Bollywood that made a chiselled physique of males, an enviable social currency. For a slightly older generation of trainers and bodybuilders, it was Salman Khan’s Pyaar Kiya to Darna Kya (1998) that witnessed the mushrooming of gyms in every nook and cranny of urban Indian gullies while 2007-2008 saw an otherwise reluctant Shah Rukh Khan succumb to a six-pack in Om Shanti Om; an infallible Aamir Khan who went from his Taare Zameen Par physique to Ghajini’s pecs in a single year. Suddenly the muscles had spilled out of the quintessential body-building akharas to frugally equipped gyms.
In-depth in research and persuasive in tone, the connections drawn across the book through real-life instances is beautifully presented in Muscular India. There are multiple references from canonical books that have dealt with similar topics that the book connects together. “It would be a mistake to think of Anoop’s scraped and callused hands as adjacent to a fetishised working-class masculinity” writes the author in a chapter titled ‘Society on Steroids’ and there are very few books that have managed to hold up such a fascinating mirror to the dichotomy of the middle class and its many divides in urban India as this one. Delving into class, economic and social structures, this recent case study will strike those who like their reality in generous and colourful dollops of servings. The gorgeous cover picture by photographer Cop Shiva only adds to what makes the book a collector’s edition.  Translated by Shabnam Nadiya (Eka; Rs 399)
Leesa Gazi is a British-Bangladeshi author whose novel Rourob was published in Bengali in 2010. An English translation of the book has emerged a decade later, packing a punch to a story that is vaguely reminiscent of Room by Emma Donoghue. Translated by Shabnam Nadiya, Hellfire is a dysfunctionally complicated tale of two sisters Beauty and Lovely and their tyrannical mother who limits their world to the four walls of the house, with rare occasions of venturing out, only when there is company. The story opens with Lovely’s birthday when her mother Farida Khanam has finally allowed Lovely to go to Gausia Market to buy cloth for a shalwar. Lovely was turning 40 that day.
Written in stark prose that only accentuates the jarring emotions that Lovely experiences in the course of a day that is her first taste of ‘real freedom’, characters are written with a sense of secrecy and urgency that only adds to the mystery of the story. There is a voice in Lovely’s head who guides her through the motions of the day, through the streets of Dhaka, like a frail but dominating companion with a slight sense of humour. It is her mindless encounters barely worth attention that appear as unsurmountable hurdles and triggers in this day-long journey of self-exploration at the ripe age of 40. A stray touch of a shopkeeper sends shivers down her spine and encountering a young girl selling water who also answers to the name Lovely, makes her melancholic and inquisitive.
Why does Farida Khanam exercise this macabre control over her middle-aged daughters? What are the reasons that built up to this dysfunctional household and the fragilities associated with it? Intriguing in parts and slow in some, the book builds up like a crescendo, revealing one secret after another, letting out the picture of a wall that is equal parts shocking and pity-inducing. Nadiya has kept her sentences short and crisp in the translation to focus more on the plot and the element of disturbance in the narration. At 198 pages, Hellfire sure makes for an intriguing read by an author who was clearly born to be a playwright. Edited by Saurabh Kirpal; Hachette India; Rs 699
There is a discernible amplification of feminist urban voices because of social media, fuelled by the need to learn and unlearn to be socially responsible citizens of the world. The ruling down of article 377 in 2018, “at 12:12pm on September 6” was celebrated around the country as decriminalising homosexuality was finally achieved, thereby reversing an archaic British import of a law. How has the journey been for the LGBTQ+ community since and is the country really headed towards a more inclusive world upholding the spirit of NALSA judgement of 2014? Saurabh Kirpal, a Supreme Court lawyer from Oxford and Cambridge university, edited a cohesive cohort of essays from legal practitioners, queer activists and allies of the community to weigh in on where we stand and what is the need of the hour. He was the legal counsel for Navtej Johar, Ritu Dalmia and all the others who joined hands to the striking down of section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.
Responsible reading is imperative in this world of fake news and who better to tell you the stories and explain a narrative than those at the forefront of the journey. There is a contemporary angle to age-old draconian laws as spoken by contributors like B.D. Ahmed who considers the triple tally to be a single, revocable divorce. There is M.B. Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court of India who passed iconic judgements during his term that included the declaration of sex with a wife who was a minor as rape. He elucidates on transgender laws of the country without mincing words, writes of the hope that was born from the NALSA judgement of 2014, which was dashed by the passage of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019. Few personal narratives include those of celebrity chef Ritu Dalmia and hotelier and entrepreneur Keshav Suri of the Lalit Group of Hotels, who has managed to turn his chain into one of the safest and most inclusive spaces in the country.
Other contributors include transgender woman and human rights activist Zainab Patel, lawyer Arundhati Katju, senior advocates Madhavi Divan and Menaka Guruswamy and journalist Namita Bhandare. The use of simple language to explain laws and the constitution, peppered with personal experiences, this book makes for the perfect kind of reading for those willing to learn. Divided into 12 essays covering sub-topics like Sex and the Individual, Sex and the Community, Sex and the Workplace and Sex and Religion, this comprehensive guide was definitely the need of the hour.",culture
Glimpse into a modern farm life through the eyes of a 24-year-old ‘farmer’," From a two-floor house to a 4,000sq ft home and a property spread over three acres, in Chandigarh. That’s where
 24-year-old Anya Gupta has grown up and lives with her mother Anuja Lath and sister Ada Lath Gupta. “A lot of my peak years when people learn how to party, I was on a farm taking pictures of snakes and birds I had never seen before. Don’t get me wrong, I party a lot, but at heart I am a farm girl,” she tells us when we catch up with her over phone. They grow their own vegetables and fruits combining traditional and modern farming methods. “I prefer my slow life,” she says. And a 45-minute chat later, we so wanted to teleport.

Such a cool life, Anya! Tell us about it…
I am basically born and brought up in Chandigarh. About 13 years back, my dad bought a piece of land on the outskirts of the city. Initially we had no plans to move in here. My dad was very fond of growing vegetables and that’s why he bought this piece of land. It is pretty close to the city and as a family, we would make weekend trips here. Slowly we started adding trees, made a pond and over time we started enjoying this place so much that when it would be time for us to leave and go back to the city, we didn’t want to. My parents decided to shift 10 years back. Most people thought ‘tum log toh bilkul pagal ho gaye ho!’ My parents were way ahead of their times.  
Both my parents have a bachelors degree in fine arts. It’s actually the passing of my dad which is central to this drastic shift in my life. I used to be an avid fast-fashion shopper. I took a break from social media and restructured the kind of content I wanted to create. I realised I was not being my dad’s girl. I consciously took the decision to dive into what they call sustainability now. It’s a buzzword now, but I figured, I have been living this life for quite some time, I think it is very unfortunate that the word ‘sustainable’ is now followed by fashion. It hardly makes up a big component of your life. One of the most important things is what are you eating. One of the things I count as true sustainability is becoming self-sufficient in terms of food. Give us a glimpse of Aura Life...
We run a small pottery studio (Aura Pottery), which gives us as a team a lot of appreciation for the handmade and all things earthy. We have a couple of programmes like weekend workshops which happen every Saturday for the local community and pottery classes where those living in and around Chandigarh can also join in. The most interesting thing is the long-stay pottery retreat where visitors from all across the globe have visited us and stayed with us for a minimum of two weeks. They pluck their fruits and veggies, eat organic, enjoy the wildlife over here.
The Airbnb is for people nearby like Delhi or Himachal Pradesh who can come for a weekend getaway. We raise our own chickens. So, you can pick your own eggs in the morning or eat home-made bread or drink fresh kombucha which we brew.
We have started opening up the place to the public ever since the lockdown eased. More and more people are getting inclined to this way of life. We give them a structured one-hour tour of all that we are doing. My aim is to build local community.

What has this farm life done to your thought process? How do you see life?
I have immense belief in living in harmony with nature. It is basic appreciation of giving back more than you take. A part of the house uses solar energy; we don’t have to depend on anybody for water because we have our own bore well. I feel if I was stranded somewhere, I can grow something from scratch or light a fire. Everything in the house, including the lights, beds, bathtub and sinks have been made at home.   Did you learn farming basics on your own?
Most of it was inspired from my dad. I was always inclined to a life like this, but it was only after my dad passed away that I picked up one of his pending projects which is AuraOKG, a patch of land we call the Organic Kitchen Garden. He was just about to start his initiative of supplying weekly organic veggies to the families in Chandigarh; just two days before the kick-start, he passed away. The fact that in the past couple of months we have mostly consumed vegetables and fruits that are native, seasonal and grown in our kitchen garden and have not taken up any fuel in being transported from one place to another, I feel I may have contributed quite a bit to reduce my carbon footprint.
What’s a typical day in your life like?
I am an early riser and wake up around 6.30am. This morning I woke up and there were seven parrots on my window. My dogs accompany me everywhere. Anytime you cut or harvest anything from a plant, it disturbs it a little bit. So, the morning time is the best time to do it. I go deliver it in the kitchen so that food can be taken care of. I love plucking veggies because it is the very physical touch of having sown something yourself and finally see it come to life... a joy in its own. We have 30 different types of fruit trees. In terms of vegetables, we now have corn, chillies, pumpkin, mint, oregano, basil, karela, bhindi, baigan. I share a symbiotic relation with my maali bhaiyyas. We have a staff of about five-six for the farm. They are my community, my extended family. We run a digital marketing agency which my parents started and this year we shifted the office inside Aura. So, now, we as a family don’t need to step out at all.
Whatever I wear is hemp based or organic cotton, in tune with nature. When I am done with the piece, I can use as compost.
My day pretty much varies. I use my personal content on Instagram to talk about my life and the other is Aura Life, which encompasses Open Days, Airbnb and workshops and events I want to organise or just brand building. These days I am a little busy with a thrift shop I am starting. As a family of three women, we have collected so many clothes over the years.
We are trying to encourage second-hand shopping of pre-loved items. Whatever funds we raise, I would like to be able to plant trees. I am also trying to harvest corns and make home-made popcorn. A Sunday farmer’s market is also on my mind where I want people to come and pluck their own vegetables.

What are your other passions?
I absolutely love spending time with my dogs and have been playing the piano since I was five. I make sure I document as much of my life as I can so that I have something to leave behind and for memories.",culture
Two rejuvenating days at the Atmantan Wellness Centre in Maharashtra," Around a three-hour drive away from Mumbai and spread over 40 acres of lush valley, the integrated wellness luxury resort Atmantan Wellness Centre sits atop a unique crystalline rock hill overlooking the majestic Sahyadri range and the pristine Mulshi lake in Maharashtra. These crystals lend the resort and all living on it, healing frequencies. Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, as lockdown slowly eases all around, Atmantan Wellness Centre has also resumed operations following necessary SOPs for both the guests and the staff. The Telegraph was hosted by Atmantan for a two-day trip that got us totally recharged...

The resort...
It offers a range of packages that one can choose from that vary in duration and prices. The resort has 106 rooms and suites and I stayed at the Ashoka Grove that had a luxurious garden view. You’re also offered a host of benefits and facilities including wellness consultation, body composition analysis, daily fitness and leisure activities such as yoga, aerobics, spinning, Pilates, pranayama, water therapy sessions and more. I was given a consultation by a health professional, a physiotherapy treatment, some personal training at the gym and two spa sessions. It’s also a tobacco- and alcohol-free resort, so guests are prohibited from smoking or consuming alcohol in the rooms, gardens, balconies or public areas, or it can lead to a ‘cleaning and deodorizing’ charge of Rs 10,000. Guests also must be above the age of 18 to check in. However, teenagers between 14 and 18 years are allowed to accompany their parents/guardians to the resort. It is encouraged that one walks around as much as possible and explores this vast property, but in case you don’t want to, there are buggies that pick you up and drop you to your destination. The buggy driver will be wearing a mask and safety visor as he/she drives you.

Safety precautions...
The property has created a four-layer screening protocol for the guests while checking in. There will be pre-arrival screening guidelines, including the travel and health history, for all the guests who confirm their stay. On arrival, each person will be screened for their temperature and a doctor’s screening will also be conducted at the Welcome Pavilion prior to check-in. All the in-house guests will also be screened daily as they enter the Wellness Pavilion. The valet service has been suspended for personal cars to ensure maximum hygiene and the guests are encouraged to park their own vehicles. Sanitisers have been provided in key areas in the wellness centre and all guests are advised to wear a mask in public areas. The spa...
There are 23 treatment rooms offering 70 spa and 10 salon treatments ranging from traditional Ayurvedic to modern Western spa rituals. I was assisted by Dr Vishnu at the Wellness Pavilion who suggested that I get the Invigorating Massage and the Purely Atmantan — Signature Massage. The 50-minute Invigorating Massage re-awakens and energises you as this treatment incorporates a therapeutic blend of pure essential oils of red thyme that works away tension and invigorates the muscles.
Next day, I opted for the Atmantan — Signature Massage, which was even better. With a fusion of massage styles ensuring ultimate relaxation of the body, mind and soul, this massage uses an antioxidant-rich aromatherapy oil that helps you feel completely transformed. The best part of the massage was the crystal palm stones that were placed on the back; it regenerates and rebalances you. All required precautions are being taken to offer the therapies, keeping in mind the safety of the guests and the employees.
I was also assisted by Amit, the physiotherapist at the Wellness Pavilion, who helped in undoing the tension knots in my shoulder. For people like me, who spend hours working in front of the computer and get backaches often, it was a big help. After that, I went for a sauna and swam at the indoor temperature-controlled salt pool that made me extremely hungry for dinner! The food...
Atmantan keeps mindful eating in mind and serves controlled portions of food. I’m not a big eater and, for the first time in my life, could finish starters, mains and desserts in one sitting. They follow the farm-to-table concept — the meals served here are natural, organic and free from preservatives, white sugar and white flour. Keeping the current times in mind, they’ve decided to serve only fine-dining vegetarian cuisine for the next few months in their restaurants. These are prescribed meals and will complement the guest’s programme and help in regaining their vitality.
They mainly have three eating areas — Chantara, the barbeque lounge, TeJus, the juice bar, and Vistara, the main dining area. I dined every day at Vistara that’s upholstered in sky shades and offers stunning views of the Mulshi lake right outside. The food is delightfully fresh from the organic farms straight to your plate.

In the end...
What stayed with me after those two days of pampering was the extreme courteousness of the staff, the breathtaking rain-soaked scenery and the extremely relaxing spa sessions that healed me from the inside. It truly felt like I’ve achieved the holistic amalgamation of the atma (soul), mana (mind) and tann (body). Do visit this resort, especially during the monsoons, for a rejuvenating experience that you’d never forget. Where: Village Palse, Tamhini Ghat Road, Mulshi, Maharashtra

What’s better than music live streams? A visual interpretation of it by VJs," A video jockey is a part of the nightlife scene as much as a DJ, which is why a lot of live streams are featuring visual artistes and jockeys. The only reason you could match your steps with Beyonce to Single Ladies or do the Chammak Challo with Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor is because a VJ (video jockey) played those visuals. A lot of VJs are taking their work online to add that edge to an hour-long musical set. Some visual artistes are collaborating with DJs and artistes while some artistes are taking it upon themselves to give viewers a visual experience.
Many music festivals — such as Tomorrowland, Burning Man, Sunburn and Ozora Festival — have gone online, with some recreating a live audience along with a stage, lights and the DJ, of course. Calcutta-based visual jockeys have also put their best foot forward to recreate a club scene at home. I want to be a VJ
The term VJ had started gaining popularity as it became associated with video jockeys who worked with music channels like MTV and VH1. The demand for video jockeys grew over time. “First people needed music, then they built a stage, then backdrops and lights were involved and eventually a VJ was needed,” says Philip Gordon, renowned visual jockey from Calcutta.
But what is visual jockeying? It is the visual interpretation and representation of something that goes with the flow of music or sound. It could be a loop of a visual, a random freestyle or mash-up of content. Under VJing, many artistes use 3D mapping which helps the artiste project a 2D or 3D figure onto a surface. They also use the method of LED mapping on an LED stage to build shapes and sizes to execute ideas and manipulate perspectives. Along with this regular videos are also used.
To start VJing, Calcutta’s Ritesh Jayswal recommends a good laptop with Resolume or ArKaos GrandVJ. Beginners can also search for DocOptic on YouTube which has 20 episodes on how to VJ. “You can start creating layers, visuals and get suggestions,” he says. YouTube has always been a great pocket-friendly tutor but besides the basics, Ritesh also uses Photoshop, Adobe Premier Pro and Shutterstock to alter his content which he stores on a hard disk. iPads and cameras can also be linked to VJ software for better interpretation. Digging Deeper
Five years in the industry, VJ Addy prefers doing visuals for club events rather than weddings. For Addy, a VJ’s job is to create the right mood and ambience through visuals to keep the crowd entertained. “For that you need to love music and understand the beats and mood,” he says. Addy was the resident VJ at Roxy before the lockdown.
VJ Philip Gordon has been in the industry for 10 years. From playing club gigs to Mandala Music Festival to Goa, the 33-year-old is known for his range of style and presentation. “I learned how to VJ from a friend from the US. Soon I was able to pull new ideas and incorporate them.” Although it’s important to know BPM (beats per minutes) and name of a track, Philip is confident enough to play it by ear. “One needs to understand the flow and when a song is entering or exiting,” he says. Philip is currently working on a virtual reality experience where the artiste/DJ will be shot in front of a green screen where he/she will be showcased in a 3D mode in a visually-created atmosphere.
Luckily, Ritesh Jayswal, before he became a VJ, was a DJ. After training under his guru (VJ Kuldeep), Ritesh started making contracts with different clubs and bars from Calcutta and eventually made his name on the clubbing circuit. Ritesh has also performed at many weddings.
Is the process of VJing different at weddings? “Weddings are more artistic. You need to make a set-up, a backdrop, use VFX and make it vibrant. Music festivals, especially underground, are all about creating a vibe. Bollywood music is about catching the beat and matching the visuals,” says Ritesh whose longest set has been 14 hours long.
When VJing, the artiste has to keep track of break downs, build-ups, understand the song’s structure, drops, progressions and maintain the energy between the DJ and him/herself. “When DJs cut and chop songs, it’s hard to know the next track,” says Ritesh.
A DJ’S friend
With social media being the strongest platform to showcase art and talent at the moment, many artistes and DJs are collaborating with visual artistes to make their sets more appealing because “looking at a person push buttons for an hour is not fun”. Each artiste in their own way is trying to make a live stream or set stand out. DJ Kunal Bose had created a set-up at his home with a green screen, lights, a sound card and a laptop to run OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) which helps steam live content without disturbances. While Kunal ensured his audio was playing straight from his console to the streaming software, Parth Raval took care of the visuals. In the live streams, Parth recreated 3D set-ups of a DJ booth with trippy visuals as the background and different characters and figures on each side (Thanos was also there!). In some of his previous projects Parth has also been able to recreate a virtual stage from scratch. “Parth never uses any downloaded content. He was with me during my time at Venom (now closed). He comes with me for my private gigs because he understands my flow and has been with me for the past 15 years,” says Kunal.

While Kunal focused more on happy visuals, Vinay Daswani, aka Bubbleguns, on the other hand, wanted something more psychedelic. For a DJ set recorded in April, Bubbleguns collaborated with Delta Process, a project known for visual jockeying. As the pandemic kept the two apart, Bubbleguns recorded the audio of his set and sent it to Delta Process. Visually the set had slow-paced visuals highlighted with green, purple, white and yellow hues which changed place and shape according to the audio. A recorded video of Bubbleguns performing live was also fading in and out from time to time.
The second stream was in association with Master of Puppets festival (Europe) where he collaborated with Binary Fragmentation. Binary Fragmentation, who is also a game programmer, built visual patches for the set and made a live recording using a combination of Unity 3D (used to create 3D games and applications for mobile, desktop, the web, and consoles) and Resolume. Then with the help of Adobe After Effects (tool for motion graphics and visual effects) he had mastered all the elements in the visuals.
Mr Streetstyle, aka DJ Ritzzze, turned his live stream into a full-blown performance. Not only did he have visuals projected on a screen behind him but also brought flutist Raman on board.
“Since people can’t go out and dance any more, I want to bring the dancing to them. It’s all about adding extra elements,” he says. According to a study by Microsoft, the average attention span of a human being is eight seconds and Ritzzze wants to hold the attention of his viewers using the three elements. Ritzzze plays his music on a low tempo, with Raman adding his soothing flute-based tunes and VJ Philip adds drama with his visuals. “I want to give them something beyond just playing music,” he says. A VJ at heart
Although collaborating with visual jockeys is a great way of presenting your work, some musicians have taken it upon themselves to showcase visuals. Calcutta-based Bolly DJ Vicky Metharamani is set to launch his new project as a VDJ (video disk jockey) in November. While performing his DJ set live he will also be playing his visuals which will be compiled beforehand.
“If I like a remix of a song then I do my visual production prior to my performance (to that song) so when I play it everything is in sync,” he says. For his international DJ sets he’s working with a team from Singapore and for his Bollywood sets he is working with a team based in Mumbai. Although DJ Vicky won’t be streaming this project live he will be preparing them for private gigs and staged events with an LED wall, which will have a strict regulation of graphics of 1080p along with visuals, animations, high-quality effects and text oblique fonts.
But why not hire a VJ? “This will help me be more in sync with my music since I have the best understanding of it. VJs make a huge difference in the industry but this is also a viable option in case of budget problems,” said DJ Vicky.
Subhagata Singha aka Rivu also went live with a quirky appearance. His streamer buddies who played online gigs with him introduced the indie artiste to OBS. Using a blue screen that was gifted to him, Rivu used his webcam and phone to stream himself, with the webcam pointed at him and the phone to his guitar. The blue screen helped him make the shades of blue transparent in the stream and dropped a background. He also made both the cameras black-and-white “just for fun”.
Was there more traction? “When people joined in they stayed a bit longer since people noticed there was some production value and it was interactive as well,” he said. With the help of OBS Rivu was able to perform an uninterrupted live set with visual elements and animations. “I also use OBS when I’m teaching my students so they can see my guitar, me and the whiteboard that I work on.”
Originally from Calcutta but currently based out of Bangalore, Shayantani C Gupta aka Shaiflai (or Shai) has also taken visual production into her hands. The techno DJ was supposed to collaborate with a video jockey but because the time frame didn’t work out it was up to her to put up a good show. Following the flow of her two-hour set for Now You Tech (YouTube), Shaiflai stitched together some video clips of abstract shots of landscapes, club nights and hotel parties. As her set continues, the visuals move to minimal designs and patterns which appear to be trippy and a lot like paintings following a blue-and-pink colour scheme. “This was my vision of a journey. Since everyone is at home now, I wanted people to relate to it and take the viewer’s mind out of the scope they are living in,” said Shai. The visuals were showcased using a projector that was directed towards Shai, her set-up and a blank wall behind her.

Visually ahead?
Clearly, visuals play a big role in music and nightlife but the method of becoming a VJ sure is a tough one. As mentioned before, to begin VJing one must have access to a lot of content, from visuals to images. Unique pictures and images are only found on subscribed websites such as Fotocorp, Shutterstock, Getty Images and others, which cost a lot. A decent, entry-level VJ controller could start at Rs 8,000. The demo version of Resolume can only be downloaded for free and a sum has to be paid to unlock the entire application. “I paid close to Rs 25,000 for my VJing license which is required by every VJ to perform,” says Ritesh.
When it comes to VJing, the country is apparently “not there yet”. The demand for visual displays are high but due to budget constraints it’s not possible in many places. “Calcutta till now isn’t the perfect place where you can showcase music and visuals in a proper manner. Many places host live visual jockey shows but we are just not there yet,” said Philip. According to him, on an international scale, organisers, festivals and clubs are “okay” with an LED layout and people do not want to move beyond it. But does the concept of visuals take away attention from music? Shai believes the two complement each other and it is a story and/or journey. People won’t vibe to music that is not good but then again people will not watch a visual live stream on mute. “Here the audience can understand that you’re making an effort and both the elements really help,” she said.
After the lockdown it has been hard for Addy to get some gigs but there is hope. He doesn’t think most VJs follow the mood of a song, which is very important. “Most people don’t understand the concept of visuals. My mother used to think that I was the light guy,” he laughs. Clubs in Calcutta also don’t have a proper screen for display, which is why the demand is not that high and so the payment seems to be less for them. “But slowly things are changing and will hopefully be better soon,” says Addy.
The pandemic has affected everyone’s work but for Binay Singh, aka Cosmic Traveller, he was forced to stop VJing and became a gamer instead. “I wasn’t getting work; how much would I earn on collaborations? Luckily, I’m also a graphic designer.” Binay would perform around 16 gigs per year and even travelled to cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Pune. But these cities found VJs from their own cities because of budget restraints of hosting and flying a VJ down.“Some people are happy with background videos; that’s their wish but I do not plan to get back to VJing,” he said.
Visual artistes sure are making our social media pages bright and vibrant and getting the recognition they deserve.
By joining the forces of music with visuals a new experience is being provided to the viewers. Each artiste in his or her own way is providing unique ideas using the same medium and exposing viewers to newer thoughts.
The collaboration so far is working out great and will hopefully open doors to newer opportunities.",culture
Another nomination comes Prajwal Parajuly’s way," Good news continues to arrive for Calcutta-based Nepali Indian author Prajwal Parajuly. Two weeks after the French translation of his 2013 novel Land Where I Flee was longlisted for the Emile Guimet Prize, it has now been nominated for France’s First Novel Prize. The translated book called Fuir et Revenir translated by Benoîte Dauvergne is a tale of four Nepali Indian siblings who arrive from different parts of the world to celebrate their slightly daunting grandmother’s 84th birthday. What follows is a family saga with dollops of humour and ingenuity that is characteristic of South Asian literature that is all heart and depth.
The author was recovering from the onslaught of congratulatory messages which were also mixed with discernible concern at the similarity of the plot with a later film Kapoor & Sons, which The Telegraph had outlined in a story recently. While well-wishers have asked him to raise a hue and cry, Parajuly wasn’t interested. Wishing everybody involved with the film well, the author was happy with the recognition his book got, seven years after it was published. Two weeks after that, more good news followed!
On the coveted list of nominees of the First Novel Prize, one can also find the Man Booker International Prize winner Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, along with the likes of Margaret Wilkerson Sexton (USA), Nazanine Hozar (Iran), Stephen Markley (USA), Olja Savicevic (Croatia), and Eduardo Fernando Varela (Argentina). The First Novel Prize is awarded annually to a French and foreign author; the final winner is to be declared on October 26. This would be followed by a ceremony on November 15 at the Théâtre de la Pépinière, in Paris. Parajuly, who is no stranger to awards and nominations for this particular novel, has previously been shortlisted for The Dylan Thomas Prize in the UK and The Story Prize in the US, even going on to be a jury member of the former in later years.",culture
A royal tale of legacy and revival," She stays in India’s “largest private residence”, the Lukshmi Vilas Palace, Baroda. He is a “royal cultural revivalist” or an “old-fashioned designer”. Radhikaraje Gaekwad and Umang Hutheesing. They shared their “Royal Story” on Episode 4 of Season 1 of The India Story Continues..., moderated over Facebook and YouTube live by writer, publicist and Nari Shakti Puraskar awardee Anshu Khanna, on September 5. The India Story Continues... is The India Story founder Madhu Neotia’s “basic notion to continue the narrative of The India Story”.  
The beautiful Radhikaraje was born in the “princely family of Wankaner, Gujarat” and later married Samarjitsinh Gaekwad. “My story of India is a mix of so many different things because of my background which is royal, but at the same time growing up as an IAS officer’s daughter who had a transferable job… I have had that experience too, which is egalitarian,” she said, giving us a glimpse of her life that she candidly considers a “privilege”.
Her Instagram bio sums up her many passions, “heritage conservationist and textile revivalist” being just a couple of them. At the live session, she traced back how she got into the revival of Chanderi. “It started in 2006 when we took our Raja Ravi Varma paintings to NGMA (National Gallery of Modern Art), Mumbai. The paintings were travelling for the first time to Bombay and there was a lot of interest generated. We thought why not do a collection of Chanderis inspired by Raja Ravi Varma. The Marathas have always been patrons of Chanderi. However, over the years she (mother-in-law Rajmata Shubhanginiraje Gaekwad) realised when she wanted real zari saris for the daughter’s wedding or my wedding, they were not being made any more. The fabric had got corrupted.... We took it up as a project,” she said. A line of saris which were inspired by the paintings of Lakshmi, Saraswati was “well-received”. “That encouraged us to continue with it because the weavers in Chanderi had no reference to what kind work was being done generations before. The level of sophistication, design and finesse of the motifs were lost. Textiles in the family helped them recreate those patterns,” she said A “history narrator”, her description of the Baroda jewels was jaw-dropping. “The Baroda pearl carpets have Basra pearls with over 2.2 million beads, ruby, sapphire, emeralds, 300-400 carats of diamonds. The Baroda pearl necklace… seven strands of Basra pearls, the diamonds…,” she shared.      
Umang for whom Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent are huge inspirations, looked back at how his family had been in “textiles and jewellery patronage for generations”. The idea that even “living heritage” should be preserved saw Umang take up the revival of royal crafts and textiles 10 years ago, with craftsmen of the royal poshak khanas who were sitting jobless. “To give employment to craftspeople, one has to find a market for their products. I see myself as a catalyst between the craftspeople and the patrons. We have done a lot of mochi kaam in tone-on-tone and pastels and revival of the crafts of Gujarat. I am a revivalist and patron. The urban patrons need a space that is more accessible. So, I opened a store, more like a salon,” he said.
He has “300 pieces” designed and made by him “in seven international museums” and has held exhibitions at Buckingham Palace and Roosevelt House. “The first thing I did was to make clothes for the royal families; royal families who wanted high quality of craftsmanship and very focused original, traditional garments. Soon I realised that royal families buy things for an occasion. If you have to survive, you have to make clothes for a larger audience,” he had told t2 in an earlier chat.
The session also saw Radhikaraje unveil Umang’s line of “rare and fine jewellery”.
A rapid fire at the end revealed while Umang loves pav bhaji and pizza, Radhikaraje unwinds over Netflix with her husband. #ModernRoyalty",culture
Gaurang Shah’s craft crusade and his ode in khadi to Raja Ravi Varma," Just like his immersive fashion shows testify, Gaurang Shah’s love for Indian handlooms, art and textiles runs deep to the bone, which he has showcased through collection after collection. Shah’s works are an intersectional tour de force of art, craft and design, which bears testimony to his unbounded love for Indian heritage, of which he has become a savant and a crusader. This is perhaps reason why Gaurang has also realised the need for a digital landscape for his artistry in the form of www.gaurang.co. But more exciting is his ambitious magnum opus of sorts in the form of ‘Khadi, A Canvas’, in which he took on the gargantuan task of weaving 30 unseen paintings of Raja Ravi Varma on to the pallus of khadi saris using Srikakulam jamdani, for which he created 600 shades of natural colour and 200 yarns over a period of two years. The project in the form of a travelling exhibition, in collaboration with the Baldota Foundation, had already made a few stops, including at major art museums in Delhi and Mumbai, before the pandemic. Excerpts from a t2 chat with Gaurang:

With over 800 weavers as a part of your looms, what were the pressures like of keeping business afloat when the pandemic hit us?
We were never worried about production as our looms continued working during the pandemic, with strict protocols. We are in the business of handlooms, and it is woven in looms by a family of two people. Our designs also take months, and some a few years, to weave, so it was always work in progress. The only challenge that hurt is sales as our collections are exclusive and of a premium range and predominantly sold in stores. Our strategy to offset this challenge was to create a digital e-store that showcases our entire catalogues of fresh collections. The e-store has a casual-wear section and also an exclusive “by invite” section for bridal and special occasion wear. Handlooms often lack lustre or sheen and ask to be felt physically. What are the challenges of taking Indian handlooms online for e-commerce?
Well for us it was a new path to discover. But we must say that it opened a new avenue of revenue generation, and also reached out to digital shoppers hitherto un-reachable. It also gave us a 360-degree view of shopping behaviour during a pandemic like Covid-19. This also helped us align our production lines in a manner that is economically sustainable and consumption friendly.
While it is a huge challenge for brands like us who sell premium products, it also gave us the opportunity to explore new categories through the digital platform. The e-store now makes our go-to market strategy fully integrated — offline-online.

As a textile revivalist and handloom enthusiast, how do you see the world today viewing an exquisite piece of patola or jamdani?
An exquisite fashion consumer’s view hasn’t changed, and it will never change. They know what they are seeking and will only buy if brands/clothing meet their aspirations. The biggest challenge for the designer and the buyer during the pandemic is to build a new perception vis-a-vis offline-online feel. Handlooms are heirloom pieces and will forever remain an irreplaceable part of an Indian woman’s wardrobe. Indian textiles are a symbol of our heritage and my passion continues to preserve this tradition and heritage, especially saris.

You also innovate with these age-old Indian weaves. What are the challenges of
a) explaining these innovations to a weaver who has been doing it for generations and
b) explaining the time taken and cost of these painstaking creations to wearers of today?
The bonding between me and my weavers is what I call “creativity”. It is a journey of teaching-learning from each other and enhancing each other’s potential beyond the unseen. The classic example is the Raja Ravi Varma project, where we took the challenge to create the iconic paintings of the artist on khadi pallu. It was a dream that my weaver and I combined to make it a reality.
Every design is a new experience for me and my weaver. They have never said no to a design even if it had to move inch by inch and eventually realised, either in several months or some that take almost five years. For example, we have a sari that came in from the loom after five years, this month. There is also a sense of joy between us when we find there is an eager consumer awaiting. What is your take on sustainable, textile fashion in India and the road ahead for it, especially post-Covid-19? Where do we stand in the global fashion industry?
Handlooms are only sustainable when we buy handlooms. The art, artistry and the jamdani weaving heritage has evolved over the years. It has gained tremendous prominence, not only on fashion platforms but it has also been endorsed and embraced by some of our greatest leaders and influencers. Each one of us is a global citizen, so there is a sense of feeling that when you visit a different country, you would love to wear customary clothing, which has given a greater boost to Indian wear as much as to western wear. Our handwoven clothing is also environmentally-friendly as they use natural elements.
We are in a world of new normal. There is a sense of less urgency in fashion consumption as people don’t meet and attend parties and there are restrictions on gatherings. Sales have almost dipped to the zero level. But thanks to the digital market, there has been some hope for high premium products as customers do like to update themselves with new trends. The volumes have certainly reduced. It is a painful time and we hope it will pass.
Tell us about your ambitious project of transferring unseen Raja Ravi Varma paintings on to a khadi sari pallu. How was it conceived and implemented?
The story goes back to 2016 when I recreated six paintings of Laxman Aelay (artist) on saris using jamdani. One of the customers was Lavina Baldota, from (Abheraj) Baldota Foundation. She liked my creation and proposed we collaborate in the future on a much grander and unique project where two forms of art bring beautiful inspiring synergy. In 2017, Lavina introduced me to the Raja Ravi Varma Heritage Foundation to recreate Varma’s works on khadi saris as a combined reverence to the artist and Mahatma Gandhi, who transformed the use of khadi. The project ‘Khadi, A Canvas’ took over two years and involved a precise replication of Varma’s unseen paintings woven onto the pallu of the sari, using the Srikakulam jamdani technique. What was even more exciting was to discover that Gandhi’s birth anniversary coincides with Varma’s death anniversary — a connection that led us to announce “Santati”. It was an idea that was hugely inspiring and was worth the test as we were weaving 30 unseen paintings of Varma on to khadi sari pallus.

Transferring paintings of an iconic Indian artist on to saris must have had its own challenges...
Our approach was to choose those paintings that people have not seen or lesser-known ones. So we shortlisted 54 oleographs. Of which, we wove 33 saris with paintings of Raja Ravi Varma on the pallu, all interwoven in khadi, in natural dyes. The paintings were chosen in three categories: women in Varma’s paintings, gods and goddesses, and stories.
To begin with, it took over six months of research. We had to begin by creating 600 shades of colours because Varma used only natural colours for his paintings in combinations of four primary colours. So we had to do everything with natural dyes to replicate the paintings in khadi and recreate the same colours on the portraits and dyed over 200kg of yarn. Our choice of using the Srikakulam jamdani technique made it possible to create the entire pattern without repetitions. While few of the saris took three months, the intricate paintings took more than 10 months to create.
The challenges were unique. The first thing we observed was that Varma’s paintings are made of curved brush strokes and it was a Herculean task to train our weavers to reconstruct his masterpieces. So for a small painting, we had blown it up to almost 40 inches to capture the details, shades of colour, texture and patterns.
The next big thing we had to tackle was to find the right pool of weavers to work on the saris. Weavers who were masters of on-paper jamdani, where they print six meters of paper (length of a sari) and put it under the warp, look at it and weave it. We were fortunate to identify and engage 20 families.
Besides using 150 counts of fine khadi, finding the right dyes and matching them according to the saris was another task. In some saris, we realised the artwork came out on the opposite side. In some saris, the colour combinations did not come out well. So, we had to rework our strategy, design, and loom setting to get the closest replica of the artwork.
Creating 600 shades of colour in natural dyes was in itself a long-drawn, painstaking process. The yarn colours ranging from pastel pinks to luminescent were equally challenging to bring-about. Another thing we had to confront was to replicate the facial expression of every single character in the paintings and the fall of their clothing as seen in the paintings through jamdani weaves.

What’s next for brand Gaurang Shah?
To continue to be inventive and to enthuse clients to drool over the handloom that we create. We are also creating a new line of collectives for our e-store clients from casual, daily-wear, office-wear, festive and bridal handwoven pieces. Favourite dyes to work with: Natural dyes. I love dabbling with new shades that will enrich my designs. Over the years, we have developed several new colour palettes, and will continue to create new exciting colours.
Favourite weave: Jamdani.
Favourite textile: I admire everything Indian, heritage and monumental.
Favourite yarn: Cotton, khadi and silk.
Favourite designer/s: Sabyasachi and Rohit Bal

A fair place to drop in," One of the pleasures of walking down Free School Street — or should we call it Mirza Ghalib Street? — still remains. It’s Sasha: the little shop tucked inside a lane near the Fire Brigade headquarters. Sasha faithfuls love to just drop in there. The air inside is gentle, and much of it because of those who look after the shop. You are greeted in like an old friend.
The products on display, beautifully handcrafted, act like a balm on sore eyes. Sasha’s business practice is gentle too. It is a fair trade shop, a not-for-profit craft development and marketing organisation working with marginalised artisan and women producers. And it’s not a small shop really. It’s quite spacious.
The good news is it’s open now, 10am to 5.30pm, Monday to Saturday. Once there you will find your favourites, such as the caterpillar leather-embossed purse or the neat and colourful coir boxes. And if you can’t drop in, you can browse through their catalogue online at https://sashafairtrade.shop. Their list of elegant jamdani hand-painted stoles and woodenware “made only from fallen trees” has made it to my WhatsApp inbox.
Adapting to the “new normal”, Sasha is reaching out to its clientele in a more personalised way. “As more people would be keeping away from retail spaces, we have created our own online e-commerce platform with a range of products from our core producers. The webshop, once activated, will showcase the best of Sasha products, will host events fortnightly and offer a platform to our social projects,” says Sujata Goswami, executive director, Sarba Shanti Ayog, a Sasha initiative. “We are reaching out to our customers through mini catalogues, WhatsApp messages and an active social media presence,” she adds. On National Handloom Day, August 7, Sasha celebrated the gamchha weavers of Basirhat, introducing the looms from the Ichhamati riverbanks. Saris and scarves handwoven by the gamchha weavers make an interesting display of red and white stripes, ivory and pale green stripes, and ivory and yellow stripes. Sasha is training the gamchha weavers to transform their skills so that they adapt to contemporary fashion styles. There are also jamdani cotton dupattas with tassels from the weavers of Phulia.
Responding to the needs of the pandemic, Sasha, under its Rasa wellness line, has launched the Rasa Hygiene Kit. The Rasa range has also been launched online.
“In Sanskrit, rasa means a response of the mind, a vital feeling. The emphasis is on naturally-inspired products using traditional recipes from age-old Ayurvedic wisdom,” says Goswami. The Rasa range includes skin  and body care products and spices. Not everything is bad news. An Indian brand of clothing is doing well globally during the pandemic. When businesses have collapsed and production chains broken down, 11.11 / eleven eleven made it to UK based e-tailer matchesfashion.com’s international edit with a collection of patchwork blankets. With fast fashion getting bad press, now more than ever, ethical labels like 11.11/ eleven eleven are being greeted in as practitioners of sustainable businesses. Blankets and quilts also help you to snuggle up in these times of trouble.",culture
An enthralling evening discussing all things Estuary with Kolkata Literary Meet," On August 29, Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet brought together two old allies of the festival for an engrossing conversation on their social media pages — author Perumal Murugan and T.M. Krishna. The book being discussed was Murugan’s latest offering to the literary world, Estuary, and joining in on the chat were director of the festival Malavika Banerjee and translator to Estuary, Nandini Krishnan. “It is a nuanced and very very contemporary novel, a true and authentic story of our times,” said Banerjee on Estuary that captures the ebb and flow in a father-son relationship in Asuralok, which originates from a single, expensive demand made by a young boy to his middle-class father.
Self-admittedly, so far, the settings of Murugan’s books had mostly been rural but this one was his first that was set in an urban land with contemporary issues that are relatable to a great extent. “What is incredible about this novel is despite the differences of the father’s world from that of his son’s, they are all layered in so many different ways and the picturisation of the differentiation is just phenomenal,” said T.M. Krishna on the book. Giving form to reality and thereby bringing alive thoughts and fears that exist in the deepest crevices of our mind, is what makes Estuary a great addition to Murugan’s exceptional portfolio.
Technology plays an incredibly large role in this book and very few books have explored the effect of technology on relationships to this great depth. “How do we understand one another and how does that change with technology, is something this book probes,” said Krishna, who is a dear friend of the author and also felt that he fit into the role of the protagonist’s best friend in the book who has two daughters, just like Krishna himself!
The reality of how education is perceived by most and discipline in the form of physical harm are nuanced topics that the book discusses. “These are not just my experiences but that of those around me. I am interested to understand how these various perspectives interact with each other. Plus I am always interacting with multiple generations of youngsters as new students come in the moment the old ones graduate,” said the author who happens to be a professor of Tamil literature.  
For debutante translator Nandini Krishnan, translating Estuary was of course a great experience but reading it as a reader and as a translator were two vastly different experiences. “Initially I was looking for the old Perumal Murugan as I have known him over the course of his previous works. But it was only when I read the book for the second time did I realise that this is not a commentary on different generations but actually the tale of loneliness of this man in the middle. The experience of disconnecting with a father and not much with the mother is something that most of us experience either as a child or as a parent. So when a man who doesn’t find the validation he needs and what that experience is like, is so beautifully portrayed here,” said Krishnan.

The stage was also opened up for audience questions, which began with “Does marriage grow with time?” To which Murugan replied, “To be frank, our family setup doesn’t give much scope for a relationship between a man and his wife. The values we bring in are not conducive to friendship between a man and a woman so there really isn’t much to progress with time.” At this, Krishna jokingly enquired about Mrs Murugan’s whereabouts!
Sitting in front of swaying palm tress in the middle of a vast field, Murugan made everyone on the panel and those watching wish to be a part of the scenery. A fresh take with fresher perspectives on the book, Estuary is already out winning hearts for those who have loved Poonachi and One Part Woman, to name a few.

Turning the limelight on Indian crafts for a cause," Kota, Chanderi, Maheshwari, Benarasi, Bhujodi, Ajrakh, Khadi, Jamdani, tussore, ikat, Bhagalpuri, Bagru, Kantha, pashmina, Jamevar and more, so much more! With a formidable repertoire of handloom and handicrafts such as ours, it’s but natural for us to associate a sense of pride and loyalty with our weaves and crafts. And what is intrinsic to that is the very human face of that industry, often limited to the hinterlands, that has borne the bulk of the brunt of the humanitarian crisis caused by the pandemic. Amidst a free-falling economy, the dissolution of the All India Handicrafts and Handloom Boards in July, though debatable, also caused some amount of ripples, though many also admitted that they did not even know it existed. But amongst all the suppositions, it’s not just an assumption but a sad reality that the crisis has hit the lowest rungs of the ladder of our handloom and handicrafts industry, comprising the artisans and weavers, the hardest.  
The Zs’ Precinct on Dover Lane, with its impetus for conservation, has always been a quiet, niche treasure trove of unique finds from across the country in the form of a wide range of hand-picked items such as saris, stoles, shawls, bags, jewellery, art and curios. Being acutely aware of the pandemic-induced pitfalls on the weaving and craft communities of our country, curator of the outlet Rajesh Sen joined hands with actress Sauraseni Maitra and t2 to conceive and curate a shoot showcasing some of the best of the outlet’s wares from their diverse range of handloom and handicrafts collection. The proceeds from the sales of this collection are set to benefit weavers and craftspeople.
Therefore last week, a small group of people in strict adherence to social-distancing norms gathered at the quaint Dover Lane address to shoot for this series. What resulted from it are four distinct looks, each carefully curated to highlight a special craft from India and the story behind its painstaking process of creation.
“During this pandemic, the biggest struggle craftspeople are facing is cash crunch since their income has disappeared. Smaller, less fortunate craftspeople have borrowings with which they created their stock. With a total washout of the festive months, craftspeople are either sitting on stock with orders cancelled point-blank or have stock sitting in outlets where they have already supplied. I feel immense pride when I see, touch and feel these crafts. When I work with craftspeople, I see in them a desire to grow and we only need more people to buy our crafts. The Zs’ Precinct will waive their commission so effectively, the range of items from craftspersons, weavers and printers will be sold at their prices — 15-25 per cent less than what is their price today for a month,” said Rajesh Sen (inset), curator, The Zs' Precinct (18/76A Dover Lane, 9007100354/033 24619353).

Federica Imperiali on diamond buying trends during the current times," Federica Imperiali speaks with clarity, conviction and empathy. We caught up with the global head of new product development, Forevermark, on her pandemic takeaways, the future of diamond buying and how women are buying jewellery on the sidelines of the Forevermark Forum 2020 (August 18-20). This was the first time the forum went virtual and the stunning Federica joined The Telegraph over a WhatsApp call from Tuscany.

How is this pandemic been treating you?
There was a big change of course. I am heading the design team. We work very much as a team in group. The fact that we were not able to sit together in one place made everything more difficult. But having said that there was no pause. Work has even increased I have to say. We work for all the markets where Forevermark is present, also for India. As a brand we have decided to keep the thing on and invest a lot in connecting with our consumers. So, we have created a lot of activities and communication to keep everything on.
The pandemic has of course affected everyone in the way that we used to interact. Now the digital platform is the main one. I also think that it has taught us a lot. We are more aware of how we can impact the environment. Till now we were saying that if we stop doing these, the environment will get okay and we will improve. But now we are all aware that even as a small gesture, if we do that together at the same time then it will have a visible impact. We are much more respectful of each other and focused on what really matters in life and what is important. There is a new order of value that has been re-established.

How are women purchasing their diamonds now and how has it impacted the design of jewellery?
I am happy you asked that question (laughs). Well, very much. It’s not just in India, but everywhere around the world, women have changed and they are much more confident of themselves. They are free to express their thoughts and they don’t need the permission to buy something. Indian women are showing the same, especially I would say Indian women. A new collection is dedicated to women with a strong design that is really able to reinforce the consideration we have of women.
We are launching the Tribute collection soon. It is a collection dedicated to women being aware that you cannot describe them as just a worker or a friend. They can be many things together. I can be a mother or a friend, but I am always very close to my belief and personality. So, this is a tribute to each part of a woman’s personality.

How do you see the pandemic affecting jewellery purchase?
The diamond jewellery is in the luxury category and the pandemic has affected the vision of the consumer on luxury. There are fewer, bigger, better pieces that are being able to justify the investment. So, when I say investment, I am not any more just looking for the pure economic investment. That for sure is important when it gets to luxury and at Forevermark we really invest a lot in that to bring to you one of the best diamonds in the world. When you buy a product, you are not just buying a product, but you are entering the universe of the company. So it is much more important that we show as a company that we are aware of what is really important for our climate, environment and community and we strongly invest in that to show that we are all part of the same family and share the same value. This is also something that will impact the purchase.

What is your casket like?
I like and wear diamonds but I also wear other pieces. I love working with all the different markets and I get inspired by each market. Right now I am wearing a kind of mangalsutra.
We are experimenting with the transformable style of mangalsutra that can become a bracelet... keep the tradition on because tradition is very important, but we also need to be aware that times are changing... so to be able to allow the younger consumer to wear something which is a symbol but perhaps not fitting into the style they want to have.",culture
Anupam Roy on 10 years of his classic song Amake Amar Moto Thakte Dao," Anupam Roy’s Amake amar moto thakte dao (from Srijit Mukherji’s film Autograph, starring Prosenjit, Indraneil Sengupta, Nandana Sen) dropped on August 20 in 2010, and it took Calcutta by storm. The song was on everyone’s lips and it catapulted Anupam into stardom. With the song completing a decade, The Telegraph got chatting with Anupam on that August beginning and his rise and rise in the music world.

How do you look back on Amake amar moto... and the phenomenon now?
When I look back now, khub aschorjyo lagey. How everything happened. It does not feel like so much time has passed. It does not feel like 10 years have gone by. It almost feels like the song was released yesterday. I am really, really thankful to the people of Bengal and beyond who have showered so much love on this song and welcomed me to the industry.

You wrote Amake... in May 2009 and performed it first in Bangalore. What are your memories?
When I wrote the song I had no idea that it would become so important and meaningful to so many people. That it would resonate with so many. I did not think of it along those lines when writing it. The words came naturally to me and it reflected what I was feeling inside. It is a love song that came to me one afternoon in Bangalore. I had to step out but when I came back in the evening I completed the song.  

Do you remember the time before the release of Amake amar moto... and what was happening then?
I would perform the song at friendly get-togethers. One day I performed the song in front of Srijitda (Mukherji) there and he really liked it. I got to know that Anjan Dutt was coming to Bangalore for a performance. Srijitda arranged for a slot for me… and I got the opportunity to perform two songs, one of them being Amake amar moto. I was still working on the song at that point of time and the refrain...  ‘Na na na na na’… came to me then during soundcheck.  That refrain was not there in the original song. It got added later. It was a special moment for me since I got to perform before a large crowd. It was a  big thing for me.

What happened once the song released?
It was magic! Suddenly all that excitement among the listeners, the outpouring of congratulatory messages and phone calls, the media frenzy... I could feel all of that from Bangalore. I was new to social media then. People were writing on Facebook, sending me friend requests, tagging me... journalists started calling me from important news channels and newspapers. Just before the release of the song, I was in Bangalore, working. I was busy recording my own album then… recording songs like Phaka frame and Ekbar bol.  

When did you know it had exploded?

Before the Pujas. I was in Calcutta for the audio launch in August and then for the film release during the Pujas. I could really feel the vibe then. I got to know the song was being played at different pandals. I was excited, and I started thinking of quitting my job in Bangalore and returning to Calcutta.

Why do you think the song connected in the way it did?
It is a mystery... the one who can decode it would be able to deliver similar successful hits! If I could figure it out then I would have made songs like Amake amar moto… one after the other (smiles). No one knows which song would connect when. Of course, people like to listen to new things… which they found in the lyrics, the voice, the melody.

Would you like to make a sequel to the song or revisit it or update it in the future?  
I would like to rerecord the song in the future. But since people are still listening to the song, I would not like to make a sequel to it right now!

How would you sum up your last 10 years in the industry?  
It feels like I was on a jet plane and time just flew by. It was really fun-filled. During school or college I was under pressure. I had to give 10 hours to my studies every day. I was working 10 to 12 hours a day at my job. After that I was writing and composing songs. At that time, life was really difficult for me. In the last 10 years, life became more free-flowing. I could enjoy artistic liberties. I enjoy this life… and as such there is no tension. Of course I have been  lucky… people loved the music I presented. I got to do concerts, I travelled the world… it was a life-changing experience. The last 10 years have been the best 10 years of my life. I am lucky that people loved the brand of music I established. I try to keep it simple and honest and if I can translate it through my writing and melody, I guess it works.

Did you ever come under pressure to match the phenomenal success of Amake amar moto?
It is beyond my control. So I don’t come under pressure. All the songs are special to me.  

How do you present it in concerts? Do you change certain things about it at times?
We changed the presentation gradually… and there is such a frenzy when we perform the song at concerts. Everyone sings this song… I almost don’t sing it. It is an amazing experience. The audience creates the magic every time at the concerts. I am just a medium. The audience connects directly with the song.

You are now producing many of your own songs and releasing them on your YouTube channel.
I have been recording and experimenting a lot during this time. I have released songs like Porichoy, which is heavily socio-political, and Bhalo theko 19, which is an experimental song. There was another song called Nirbashoner gaan, which talked about the mon kharap that stemmed from the lockdown. I also released English and Hindi songs from my channel. My song Aisi raaton did phenomenally well… I feel encouraged to create more such songs.

Would you like to do an online concert from home? What are your thoughts on digital concerts?  
Musician prefer performing live, before an audience. It involves a different kind of energy… different kinds of moments get created at concerts. The Bengali music industry has been hit severely by the pandemic. Our music industry works through live gigs. We can’t do live shows now. Yes,many musicians are doing online gigs now. I think it is happening mostly in the east. Right now, I don’t feel the urge to do an online concert. I am hoping things will get better soon and we would get to perform live, like we used to before. Let’s see what happens. We are hoping for the best.",culture
Musicians who have tickled our funny bone," Who knew that an intense scene from the TV show Saath Nibhaana Saathiya would turn out to be a hilarious meme that broke the Internet?! The man behind the meme? Yashraj Mukhate (inset). The musician based out of Mumbai reworked the Rasode mein kaun tha scene into a peppy tune and also auto-tuned a lot of Kokilaben’s (played by Rupal Patel) lines. Although this wasn’t his first ever remix (if we can call it one), it had us all in splits along with some Bolly names like Rajkummar Rao, Taapsee Pannu and others. The humour and drama of this meme got us inquisitive about other artistes and musicians who may have done something similar. And we hit gold! DJ Snake: With a lot of time on our hands these days, DJ Snake put his “boredom” to use. As Cardi B’s overenthusiastic speech on coronavirus made the rounds on the Net, the Magenta Riddim producer used Cardi B’s voice and turned it into a heavy trap song and how. The producer sanitised his hands, sampled Cardi B’s voice and laugh, recorded the sound of a fork hitting a spoon, added a some chords and beats and curated a 57-second track. DJ Snake also produced a similar track with the sound of a screaming mongoose and captioned it “I’m bored.” The video on YouTube has about 11 million views. Sambit Chatterjee: Drummer of Aswekeepsearching, Sambit Chatterjee, also used his musical abilities for a bit of fun. Last year Sambit posted a video of himself beatboxing to a boomerang of Mallika Dua from one of her Insta posts. While Mallika’s voice played the vocals, Sambit gave it a rhythm with bass kicks, hi-hats and even added a little dubstep to it. Imagine adding more fun to a video made by Mallika! Of course it reached her and she gave it a like and shared it on her Instagram feed. Anshuman Sharma: After Rasode mein kaun tha, a mash-up of a journalist made by Anshuman Sharma got a lot of attention. What impressed us more was his take on how to make a song like Ritviz (inset). On July 6, Anshuman from Mumbai posted a step-by-step video of how to make a Ritviz track, starting by picking “any environment friendly word like baarish, roshni, paani, dhoop, hawa…”; he chose asmaan. Step two was to add random sentences followed by playing “happy” chords. He then added random Indian percussions and a bassline (80s synth bass to be exact). For the next step he “pretended to be really high” and sang his lyrics. For step seven he inspired himself with South Indian wedding songs and created a melody. He then put it all together and created a track that sounds almost similar to that of Ritviz. Ritviz complimented Anshuman on a live stream and even challenged him to produce another song using his tune. Charles Cornell: If you search for Charles Cornell’s description on YouTube it will say, “I make music out of stuff.” The content creator and musician rose to fame composing original pieces of music inspired from random videos, clips and tweets on TikTok. On May 10, 2019, with 52 subscribers, Charles did his first ever Piano Meme using a video clip of Cardi B (are we missing a trend here?) going gaga over a shoe. Charles matched the chords to the tone of her voice that made the viewers laugh till they teared up. Not only was this shared by Cardi B but Snoop Dog (inset) had also posted it on his Instagram. With the success of this Piano Meme, he went on to make a compilation of many others that featured DJ Khaled, Jason Mraz, Terry Crews, Jeff Goldblum and more.",culture
Olivier Lafont on his new children’s fantasy novel Oop and Lila," Olivier Lafont spent 30 years of his life in India before moving back to Paris a couple of years back, to connect with his French roots. Most of us remember him as Suhaas, who was ditched at the altar by Kareena Kapoor’s Pia in 3 Idiots. But there’s more to Olivier who, along with being an actor, is also a writer. Olivier has now written yet another children’s fantasy novel, Oop and Lila: Lost in the Scarabean Sea (Hachette India; Rs. 350), that tells the tale of two siblings who embark on a surreal journey surrounded by pirates and wish-making candies. “Writing is a very internal process while acting feels slightly external and I enjoy both the roles immensely,” he tells us. He joined hands with Hachette India and Storytellers Bookstore in Calcutta to be on an exciting online session discussing all things books with viewers on social media.
He moved to India when he was seven years old and moved out a couple of years back to connect with his French roots, but the Bandra spirits still call out to him and he misses the city and the country immensely, he continues. He wouldn’t mind coming back to India for fun and cerebral roles and if the stars align and time and place just work out on their own. But he isn’t holding his breath. He fondly remembers his previous experience with the Indian film industry but the world of French cinema and television keeps him on his toes now. The Telegraph had a fun Zoom call with Lafont discussing his new book and recounting fond memories from his time with Bollywood. Excerpts...

Why fiction and why fantasy?
I have been reading and writing fantasy for a while now and my previous book The Rise of the Midnight King (2019; Talking Cub) that has recently been shortlisted for the Neev Books Awards 2020, is also children’s fiction. I feel that there is a lesser gap between fantasy for children and fantasy for adults as there is in any other form of fiction. A good example would be J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. And I have always been comfortable writing fantasy.

What kind of books did you read when you were growing up?
I moved from France to India when I was about seven years old. I didn’t know English or Hindi and had a massive culture and language gap. One of the ways I mastered the English language was through reading, with easier access to fiction. Going to an international school meant I had access to a lot of international titles as well that wouldn’t be found so easily otherwise. So Tolkien, Terry Brooks, Terry Pratchett, Michael Moorcock and of course Enid Blyton and her seminal works that included illustrations with texts. Those images stayed in your mind and I couldn’t separate them from her texts. Amar Chitra Katha was one collection that was deeply rooted in Indian culture as opposed to other authors I was reading that was more for a western audience. I did a recent session with Amar Chitra Katha and it was so wonderful; like coming a full circle. I still read a lot of fantasy fiction, a love story that started at age eight or nine!

Could you take us through the inception of Oop and Lila…
My general methodology is collecting a list of ideas that have been ongoing for years and I keep adding to it. These ideas range from a scene to a full story even, dialogue or an interesting character. Some of these things stay on my mind and come to mean something to me. Over time, some of these things tend to come together. There were three such ideas that came together in Oop and Lila — snow globes that contained entire worlds in them, wish-candies with 99 wishes and exploring the sibling dynamic! Especially the 99 wish-candies because, with a genie and his three wishes, one tends to get cautious. But one can be a glutton with 99 wishes!
I had to choose a setting, as to where the first snow globe adventure should be and the pirate setting just evoked. Even within the pirate setting, the golden age of the 1600s somehow fit in our real world. I was familiar with the Caribbean pirates but I knew nothing about the Asian pirates. So for me to discover Kanhoji Angre, the Maratha admiral and it was just such a seamless integration into my book. When you have all those elements, that was the beginning of the work. Once it has reached a critical mass of ideas, then only do I start writing. I know the general direction I am going in but I also want to explore and find things out myself as I write.

Do you feel any pressure of being morally correct because you are writing for children?

I think there are two levels to this. There are certain conventions that you know you don’t write for children. But I don’t think there is any particular obligation to write a moral story. The second layer is then whether you want to make or put a moral layer to the story. That was there with Oop and Lila because it gave another layer of meaningfulness to the story. They could have just had a wonderful adventure, like Enid Blyton’s The Magical Faraway Tree but I wanted to bring in the moral angle in Oop and Lila. For me, it gave it a certain personal depth alongside the fun and adventure. So that was a conscious thing that I did want to do, yes.
I miss my family in India, especially the current times when there is anxiety involved. That feeling of being in India is so warm and comforting... the particular culture of Bandra... the particular quality of the atmosphere. I love being in France but I miss being in India.

What attracted you to Bollywood without even knowing the language?
There was something I felt and saw when I was first introduced to Bollywood at 19. I used to be in the US and I would come back for holidays to spend time with my family. There was a specific kind of energy that I saw in Indian films, you know? Western films are generally more rooted in reality whereas the fantasy element of Indian films really appealed to me. That people just break out in larger-than-life dances was so enticing. There was the fluidity of expression without having to stay rooted to reality! That as a form of artistic expression was very appealing to me. And I missed India, nostalgically, so there were a number of reasons why I chose to come back to India.

How was your experience with the Indian film industry, if you had to sum it up?
It was really fantastic, to be honest. Coming from a multi-cultural background, I have always had an interest in languages. It’s very different learning a language as a child as opposed to doing it at 22, when it’s very intellectual because you are more aware. It was such a nice feeling of accomplishment. So learning it was such fun.
I loved working with Kareena Kapoor and Aamir Khan. Everybody was so kind and wonderful to me. When I shot that particular scene with them with the watch, it was a night shoot and I came in and was getting my bearings. In a shoot, time is of the essence, you know? And I knew my lines, I had everything in place. She was so kind and she said, “Take your time, you can take all night if you to want,” and you know, she didn’t have to say that but she was so kind. However, my highlight was shooting for an ad with Amitabh Bachchan. I mean, I watched Coolie when I was young and then to meet and shoot with him was surreal!",culture
The changing ‘how’ of events," What does it take to organise award-winning, large-scale, seven-day weddings attended by thousands and to tone down and concentrate on 50-people events in the present day? Hear it from Prairna Khuller, whose planning company Eventzinspired is fresh from winning two big awards at the Wow Awards Asia.

Congratulations on the two awards! Tell us about them…
Wow Awards Asia (organised by EventFAQs Media) saw applications from 25 countries such as Dubai, Bahrain, Thailand and India for their Indian wedding celebrations from March 2019 to April 2020 and my company, Eventzinspired was one of the two gold award winners for the Wedding Celebration of the Year. The #Jagari wedding that took place in January this year was a Jain wedding of 3,500 people spread across seven days, with each day having a different theme and location. The theme of the wedding was Rajwada and the bride wanted us to recreate the splendour of an old-fashioned palace in the humble P.C. Chandra Garden. Having back-to-back events during this wedding that stretched across seven days took three months of planning.
There was a traditional Jain beginning to the wedding, a bohemian sundowner for the couple, a colourful garden-themed mayra ceremony, a Bengali-style haldat with Bengali folk dancers and 30,000kg of petals were showered in those three hours, and the wedding was the biggest with a king-style arrival for the groom. Thirty-five dancers welcomed the groom in his chariot, 20 dancers were for the bride who had a special palki made, a separate structure was made exclusively for the varmala and I remember seeing thousands of cell phone flashlights going up in the air — it was a spectacular sight! The bride wanted her wedding to be remembered and turns out, this award was announced on her birthday!
The second award we won was the bronze award in the category of “anniversary/birthday celebration of the year” for a one-year-old’s birthday, unlike the usual milestone birthdays and anniversaries that have become the norm now. The parents wanted to do a cocktail dinner for their friends and a birthday party for kids. So we did two events in one evening, held at Hyatt Regency Kolkata — it started with a circus-themed party in the early evening and later evolved into the Cirque du Soleil-style party for their parents. Common themes like popcorn at the birthday party and a popcorn-themed floral arrangement at the cocktail party tied the two parties together. We researched a lot for this event and were so happy to win the bronze for this.

What does this award mean to you?
Winning two awards was a big high for not only our company at this time but with every such award we win on a big platform, Bengal is taken more seriously. Most of the labourers who do these beautiful weddings are all Bengali so this award coming to Calcutta makes me very proud. Doing events endlessly is like a death sentence for our creativity and because we do around eight such grand weddings in a year, we can give it our endless thought, creativity and efforts. All the modern innovations, especially with virtual events right now, should be credited to my daughter, Pragya Chopra Khuller who brought with her creative eye and experience of her design degree from Symbiosis (International, Pune) and having worked in Mumbai. Both the wedding and the birthday were ideated and executed by her and she did a great job.

How has it been doing events during the pandemic?
We have done three virtual and two physical events. The planner’s role has become of utmost importance during this period because sometimes the client has faith in us when they can’t physically be here. For example, a birthday girl’s fiance is depending only on me to execute his ideas for his to-be bride to do everything, from creating a photo-themed walk to arranging for a guitarist and a different cake, so that she does not miss her fiance’s presence, is a lot of responsibility.  

What are some of the major changes and challenges that you have faced?

I think it’s important to accept reality first. The definition of “big” has changed completely. We have to think new to make the client happy so that they feel that we have given them the same “big”, within the limitations of today. For food now, maybe we’ll curate the best hamper that could have everything the client could think of; for decor, we’d rather make a pre-made photo op that can just be propped up at the venue and instead of a band, we can provide a good, virtual artiste. There is no choice but to pay attention to quality, detail and creativity to still be able to make our clients feel special.
I am clear on this that the safety aspect should not be compromised on. My team is the core team, the panning has to be tight and the vendors need to know all the rules. Sometimes the client also needs to be made aware of the limitations because promises that can’t be kept should not be made right now. We are very particular about following all necessary guidelines and permissions and yet delivering a great experience. We, as planners, have to be far more responsible right now than we ever were.

How do you visualise the future of this industry?
I don’t see big weddings happening till the end of November though a lot depends on the government. For people to whom (size of the) wedding matters will probably try to postpone. We’ll probably have to wait till December-January to see the same amount of money being spent that we were used to and I still see a question mark surrounding destination weddings. Safety is bigger than travel. We’ll have to get creative within the limitations that we have.",culture
Trendy for good," I was rather amused the other day when visiting a friend and hearing a small group of adolescents bantering, not with each other but with poor Alexa, the virtual assistant that has been the only real interaction with the verbal outside world for many over the last five months.
So, one among the giggly batch asked Alexa, in between bashful chuckles, “Alexa, who is a Covidiot?” While Alexa, the ‘know-all’, went a virtuous “Sorry, I am not sure” and the kids went on to other important conquests, I was wondering myself what the word meant and if I had heard it right. Turns out, the word was ‘legit’ and was only one of the many words that this pandemic has contributed towards expanding our vocabularies.
Seems like while we were struggling with ‘flattening the curve’ and wondering if respirators were mini ventilators, the world had invented a lingo of its own during this dreadful span. So a ‘Covidiot’ is apparently a person that blatantly ignores the Covid health guidelines, while a ‘Covidient’ is someone who is the opposite of it, a ‘Covideoparty’ is when a group of lockdown bored lot decide to watch a movie together, on different screens.
While at it, don’t just ‘doomscroll’ your way through this article, since it is not meant to scare you with depressing news, but you might as well pour yourself a ‘Quarantini’ (the cocktail-to-go when quarantined), you know, just to get your mind off the improbable ‘coronapocalypse’. While trying to figure out how a rather dismal period in history gave rise to these rather eclectic terms, which obviously are trending all over the Internet as we read this, I was also left wondering if these terms will stick on once this pandemic is over. Perhaps these will, if nothing else, then just to remind each other what each one of us had sailed through.
Talking of trends, how about other ones that this pandemic sort of brought to the fore and which might last way beyond the point in time when we’ve woken up from this nightmare? How about trends related to food? I have been writing about various food and lifestyle trends that emerged due to this pandemic, most for good, and I do believe that many of these will last way longer than we give these credit for. Let us discuss a few among those.

Take-Me-Away

So there always was a market for takeaway foods, by and large limited to the days you didn’t want to cook or were anticipating all restaurants to shut while you felt hungry at 3am after a round of merrymaking with buddies. While this market, driven by the too-busy-to-cook millennial, was already on a growth trajectory, the prevalence of this pandemic saw most, if not all, high-end restaurants come up with their own takeout and delivery menus with all their iconic dishes, adapted in packaging and delivery to the current situation. While this pandemic is hopefully on its way out, I do believe that this trend of takeout and delivery of all kinds of foods, including gourmet top-of-the-line offerings, will sustain itself. That’s mostly because first, it might still take a while for people to reconcile with the ‘normalcy’ in the post-Covid-19 period, resulting in restraining themselves from visiting their favourite restaurants for a while and also because the food industry itself has realised the merits of this model of guest service and will most likely be quite aggressive in promoting and marketing this for its inherent cost, taxation and logistical advantages.

Yan Can Cook —So Can You
While I have borrowed this tagline from the very popular cooking show featuring the Chinese American chef Martin Yan, who has been telling the people across America and the world about the dexterities of cooking at home for the last 30 years or so, I guess he is being taken most seriously now. According to a report in the reputable Harvard Business Review, more than 50 per cent of Americans are cooking more than they did before the pandemic and 35 per cent say that they enjoy cooking more than before.
While many predicted cooking as an activity, especially by the young, urban, dual-career population, to be headed the ‘sewing’ way, wherein just a few decades back everyone had a sewing machine at home while now only a fraction of the young sew anything, except for a small minority that enjoy it as a hobby. But, apparently, this pandemic has woken up the woke when it comes to realising our inherent cooking potentials.

If the Internet is to be believed — and we do believe the Internet — the gorgeous ‘home-cooked’ pictures and videos flooding the web alone can tell us about the brawny trend of the young and the old. The recreational once-in-a-while cook to the seasoned  I-cook-better-than-professional-chefs individuals, all have realised that cooking at home is not what they should have dreaded and that most foods are actually quite easy to prepare once one has a go.
In my view, one of the most defining long-term trends that will continue way after this pandemic is that many of the average folk — having realised the virtues and importance of being able to cook at home and tried their hands at cooking dishes that they only ever associated with their favourite restaurants — would add to a new breed of ‘home chefs’ and ‘YouTube chefs’ who will encourage and inspire the average ‘culinarily illiterate’ among us to try our hands at reasonably involved gourmet cuisine. After all, if Yan, Vihaan, Aryan and Hassan can cook, so can you!

Frugal Fiddles
I have written about it in the past and, I reiterate, this pandemic has had all of us thinking about the uncertainties of lives and livelihoods and, to that extent, had us realise the virtues of practising restraint in all our spending activities, including food. While the ‘pandemic pantry’ is a thing now where people are trying to stock their pantries and fridges in the most economical way possible, it is also true that most among us want to see our supplies last that much longer and ‘leftover food cuisine’ is emerging as a trend in itself.
It is not unusual to find repurposed, or ‘upcycled’ as it is respectably called, ‘risotto parathas’ or ‘dal-chawal pancakes’ unabashedly confirming to the trend of ‘use all-waste nothing’ style of cuisine. It is also true that this pandemic had us recognise and realise the importance and efforts of the people behind producing and cooking our food and that by way of respect to them, apart from the obvious monetary savings, many among us now feel somewhat guilty when trashing away that bit of pasta, or if you are someone like me, throwing away that ‘gorgeous’ watermelon rind.
I had written a piece called Delicious Discards and was really awed by the positive responses I got to the article, further entrenching my belief that, going forward, most among us will understand the true value of food, independent of its price, and will behave responsibly towards consumption and preparation of it.

Tech Tripping
Gone are the days when the air fryer used to be the most remarkable piece of kitchen technology. While restaurants across the globe, especially the upmarket ones, had been harnessing the power of technology for a while towards easing their processes such as table reservation, billing and purchase, we realise that technology has played a defining role in the way the food service industry is responding to the pandemic-created protocols and the general functioning in these times.
While there are now mobile apps for accessing the menus and virtual reality videos that take you through the preparation of your food while you drive your way to the restaurant, the development of artificial intelligence has also had many restaurants and hotels assign robotic interfaces to the guests while maintaining the personal, albeit non-physical ‘touch’.
Restaurants are also using technology to reach out to guests, deliver food, obtain feedback and provide updated information. Some restaurants are also experimenting with wearable devices and virtual reality training for its staff to prepare them for the changing industry demands. On the other hand, some web portals have developed an image-to-recipe generation system that enables users to reverse engineer recipes by just uploading an image of the dish, following which the system generates a recipe and ingredient list and even related videos on the web.
Comfort calling
Another significant culinary trend emerging out of this pandemic is the prevalence of people going back to the most basic, comforting dishes and recipes. If you closely scour the Internet, you’d find that most youngsters trying their hand at cooking don’t care much for the modern fusion genre — think dishes like flash fried scallop mousse with chocolate foam. They are, however, experimenting with the tried and tested dishes, the ones that evoke familiarity, nostalgia and easement.
Here I present one such dish (see box), a please-all preparation that can be made in minutes and can be had for any meal period while instantly lifting your mood and those of the ones around you. It is the paradigmatic classic Egg Benedict. Bon apetit!

Jeff Kinney on how Greg Heffley happened," Greg Heffley became a force to reckon with for kids and adults alike with The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and the man behind the illustrations and laugh-till-you-drop humour is Jeff Kinney, who had no  idea what an icon he was going to create when he started writing about this character. There is something about the ‘Wimpy Kid’ that will have you hooked to his crazy world of bizarre ideas that almost always seem to go wrong. Aided by his sidekick, Rowley, Greg wants to take over the world someday. His books have since been made into films with a loyal fan-base around the world.
Recently, Rowley, the loyal best friend, was given his own series and the second book, Rowley Jefferson’s Awesome Friendly Adventure is now available (Puffin; Rs 499). Amidst the creation of this world, Kinney also started an online role-playing gaming universe called Poptropica that saw immense fan following worldwide. The Telegraph spoke to the author about his inspiration and ideas behind this crazy and funny adventures of the author and his characters. Excerpts.

When did you know you wanted to write/illustrate/create art for kids? What led you here?
It happened quite by accident, really. My grand ambition was to be a newspaper cartoonist. I couldn’t get past the gatekeepers, so I needed to find a way to get my comics into print — somehow. In 1998, I came up with the idea for The Diary of a Wimpy Kid. But I wanted it to be a book for the general humour section, targeted at adults. In the nine years I worked on the book, I wasn’t thinking about a kids’ audience at all. And so I was a little shocked when the publisher I shared it with said I’d written a kids’ series. Tell us about the inception of Wimpy Kid. How did you decide to build a slightly flawed, naughty character that would be equal parts relatable and hilarious?
In a sense, that happened by accident as well. Because I was writing for adults, I wasn’t thinking about a kid reading the book. That allowed me to write a complicated character who was flawed and not always a reliable narrator. As a reader, you have to understand that to enjoy the books. If I had known I was writing for kids, Greg Heffley would’ve been more saccharine, in a way.

What was that defining moment personally when you knew the world of the Wimpy Kid had become a sensation worldwide?
It built slowly, so there was no grand moment. But about 10 years in, I visited China, and when I met kids there who had grown up reading my books, I was floored. Now, when I write, I’m thinking of those kids in faraway lands. The stories create that connection.

How involved were you with the process of film-making when the books got made into films? What was the experience like?
I was as involved as a writer could be — for the first three films — without being the screenwriter. So, I helped shape the stories and was there on set. I had a voice in casting, choosing the director, and had involvement in many other aspects of the film. A feature film is a director’s medium. So, everyone’s job is to support the director’s vision. It’s important to know that going in. Rowley has always been Greg’s sidekick whose character was never the hero who naughty kids would be inspired by.
What led you to build him into a hero (literally!) and give him his own series?
That happened organically. I wrote a sample piece from Rowley’s point of view in the (United) States, and then built on it for World Book Day in the UK. I really enjoyed writing in Rowley’s voice and decided to make a full book of it. I’m finding now that Rowley gives me a creative outlet. His work is less complicated and more imagination-driven than Greg’s books.

How would you define your books — comics, illustrated novels, or a completely different genre?
I’m not sure it matters. The language of the books, the DNA, is in comics. In Germany, they have a section of the bookstore that’s called ‘Greg and Friends’, for books that look like mine. I think that’s cool.

Writing for children comes with added responsibilities. Have you ever felt the need to be extra cautious so as to not convey the wrong message or to correctly convey the right message?
I do try to be cautious. And, truthfully, the world has changed a lot since I started writing these books. Social media as it exists now was barely a notion when my first book came out. Kids are experiencing childhood differently than I did growing up.

How do you arrive at a theme for a particular book?
I always try to write about an aspect of childhood I haven’t touched on before. So my new Wimpy Kid book is about the family camping experience, which is territory I haven’t fully explored.

Have you experienced a transition or any kind of change over the years in your writing and illustrating style while building the Wimpy Kid series?
Honestly, I try to stay consistent. I’d love for a kid to be able to enter the series at any book, and to have the quality of writing and illustrations be the same as any other. But I’ve gotten a little better at writing narratives over the years, and my drawings tend to be more complex these days.

Tell us a little about Poptropica and what you wanted to achieve with the universe you built there.
I created Poptropica with a great team of creative talent at the same time the first Wimpy Kid book came out. It was quite a privilege to reach hundreds of millions of kids a year. I miss being a part of that team. I’m now encountering kids who grew up on Poptropica. Being a part of kids’ lives is amazing.

Who are some writers and illustrators you look up to and follow?
I’d say my favourites are Bill Bryson and Malcolm Gladwell. Incredible communicators and storytellers.

What can we expect next from your table?
Hopefully I can finish the 15th Wimpy Kid book on time! I’m drawing 12 hours a day now, but that will inch up to 16 by the end. I’d love to write a third Rowley book after that!",culture

"Love, longing and lust are my three favourite topics: shutterbug Suneet Varma"," Edgy. Stark. Raw romance. Couturier Suneet Varma’s photography is arresting. There is an an element of playful charm coated generously with drama. They have a dialogue with you. Much like what Suneet looks for in a good picture. “I need to be immediately drawn to it and instantly have an empathy. Love, longing and lust are my three favourite topics,” says the Delhi-based designer whose middle name can very well be humility. A chat with The Telegraph.

You have always loved photography, right?
I have actually always loved photography and followed photography as an art form. I have actually followed photographers pretty much all my life.
My love for photography also comes from my love for Prabuddha Dasgupta. We were best friends for a long time, till he passed away. When I literally did my first collection ever that I was going to sell at Ensemble in Bombay, I must have been 22 and he must have been 28-29... he was this photographer from advertising who had been asked to do this campaign for Ensemble. He asked me if I would help him style it. He was shooting a bunch of designers. The one photograph he shot of my garment with Feroze Gujral won him the award to go and work with Yves Saint Laurent in Paris in 1989. He actually put me in that picture (laughs). He said he needed a prop and I was the prop for him.
We did a lot of work together and shot numerous times. Many many times we also collaborated professionally as a team... we would do all the Grasim and Vimal ads. He was the photographer and I was the stylist. We were so in sync artistically, he would tell me ‘Suneet you should do photography’.

What have you learned from Prabuddha Dasgupta and how has it helped hone your craft?
I learned from him to never lose the beauty. Every photograph has a story and no two people in the world would look at a photograph the same way. What might be sensual for you, might be erotic for me and vulgar for someone else. What might be sad for you, might be poignant for someone and poetic for someone. So, people look at photographs differently and at different points in their lives, but if a photograph is shot with beauty, that can never be subjective. The one thing I did take from Prabuddha is that I take everything sensually... men, women, clothes.

There is a lot of drama in your pictures...
I just like drama. The funny thing is I am not a very dramatic person. My pictures have elements of drama and my shows are very theatrical. I think like that. It is very hard for me to separate my fashion from my photography. I have an extremely large canvas and a sense of expanse. I like big things... even if it is a photograph of a guy in a room, it should jump out at you and say something.

How old is your Instagram page @suneetvarmaphotography?
I started dabbling say about four years ago. Then about three years ago I started to get work. I have shot for leading magazines professionally. I have done the entire campaigns for FDCI, all the 36 designers participating in the fashion week. I have shot Siddartha Tytler’s campaign and recently I shot Pavan Sachdeva’s campaign. I sometimes do it as a favour to a friend and more often than not, I get paid for the job, but I do a lot of other things. I shoot friends or collect a bunch of people and models and shoot them.

What camera do you use?
I use a Canon and also have a couple of old cameras of my father which I don’t use.

Did he also have a passion for photography?
He could also paint and sculpt. So, there was always canvas floating around and some camera too. My mother is a prolific and well-known poet and writer (Indira Varma).

Do you see frames everywhere you go?
I am obsessed with that. I go to places and I literally freeze. I look at a ray of light coming through the window and this beautiful green leaf shining or a beautiful girl with an extra strand of hair on her face and I just get enthralled. I find beauty in so many things. I have done a lot of photography in studios as well, but personally I love natural light photography. Just give me a beautiful boy or girl and natural daylight and I will create magic. Studio is great for commercial work.

Do your carry your camera everywhere?
I carry it everywhere. I like to do backstage work... girls getting dressed and accessories being put on. I love that story as well. Of course you get incredible imagery from the ramp... backstage has that one sense of waiting... anxiety with beauty... some expectation. Love that moment.

Are you a little biased towards this baby of yours?
It’s more exciting because it’s the newborn. It needs more nurturing and I spend more time nurturing it, but fashion and clothing is always going to be my first loves, the apple of my eye... my firstborn and it is also my bread and butter.
When I do a fashion show, I get a set designer, but I design the set, the last detail... they can’t move it one inch! That’s my other side, the control freak side. I like to take control of the creative aspects. In my mind’s eye, I was always a photographer.
What would be your dream projects?
I am fairly new to it, so I don’t want to be presumptuous but I can tell you about the imagery I have always admired. Richard Avedon created this imagery for Dior in the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s. Before him was Cecil Beaton who photographed all the princesses including Prince Elizabeth, Maharani Gayatri Devi, the beautiful Cecil Beaton book. In the ’70s and ’80s, there was Bruce Weber. Then Mario Testino in the ’80s and the ’90s. There’s Peter Lindbergh whose work I love. Also, people who created the modernity of fashion when they started doing modern campaigns for Calvin Klein and soon after followed by Tom Ford. Very cool and cutting edge, sexy, very new and in some ways, it drove a moment. It is very rare when people will follow an imagery and make that idea popular.
In India, Prabuddha was the absolute best, the role model. I worked extensively with Farrokh Chothia, Tarun Khiwal, Ashok Salian, Bharat Sikka. We were a small group of fashion-driven people and we all found each other (laughs).

What else do you like shooting?
I love greenery, trees. I don’t like mountains so much because I can’t scale them, but ever since Tree of Life (1993), I have loved trees. They are biggest nurturers of human civilisation.

A place that is a photographer’s delight...
There is no place with better light than Goa in India. You have got beautiful old buildings, clear skies, the wind and the sea. I love Cochin as well. Recently I did a big shoot in Singapore and really liked it. There is something about the crispness.

Do you have a dream picture you want to shoot?
I want to go to Kerala and do a whole romance series in the backwaters. I also like the idea of connecting art to photography like Raja Ravi Varma or Botticelli’s paintings and how people have taken those ideas and created imagery in photographs. Shyamoli Varma in a breastplate from my first collection, that has kind of defined a very large moment in Indian fashion. It keeps coming in references and that is the great beauty of imagery. I think if you can create five such images in your lifetime, that would already be a lot.",culture
The Emile Guimet longlist features Calcutta-based Prajwal Parajuly," France’s Emile Guimet Prize is given every year to an Asian author whose book has been translated into French and this year, Calcutta’ Prajwal Parajuly is on the coveted list with his 2013 release Land Where I Flee, which was translated by Benoîte Dauvergne to Fuir et revenir. Accompanying him from India on the list is Manu Joseph’s Miss Laila Armed and Dangerous, which was translated by Bernard Turle to Miss Laila armée jusqu’aux dents. Pakistan’s Fatima Bhutto is also on the list with Comme Des Lions. Awarded by the Emile Guimet Museum in Paris, previous winners have included the likes of British writer Rana Dasgupta, South-Korean author Hwang Sok-Yong and Natsu Miyashita from Japan.
Parajuly, an Oxford scholar, who spends his time at Writer’s residences and teaching overseas once a year, is based out of Calcutta and wrote about a reunion from hell in his book Land Where I Flee. “It’s a family reunion that takes place in my home town of Gangtok, where I grew up as the son of a Nepali-Indian father and a Nepali mother.” says the author as The Telegraph catches up with him on a call.
The plot revolves around Chitralekha’s 84th birthday, which is attended by her grandchildren — oncologist from New York Agastya, Oxford-educated achiever Manasa and disgraced eloper Bhagwati. While Agastya is hiding a grave secret, Manasa and Bhagwati have their own demons to fight in front of a formidable grandmother who doesn’t flinch while flinging abuses at those she believes deserves them. “She is exactly the grandmother I did not grow up reading about. She smokes bird with men of power with complete disregard for supposed authority,” adds the author!
While reading the book, one can’t help but draw parallels between his 2013 release and the 2016 film Kapoor & Sons starring Fawad Khan, Sidharth Malhotra, Alia Bhatt, Ratna Pathak Shah, Rajat Kapoor and a grandfather in Rishi Kapoor, as opposed to Parajuly’s Chitralekha. However, his character Agastya, the one with a secret, has a narrative that matches to the last dot with Rahul, played by Fawad Khan. The author, initially reluctant to comment, finally opens up about how I was perhaps the 50th person to draw this parallel between the book and the film that released three years later. “It is such an understated and fantastic movie. I initially didn’t want to talk about it because I didn’t want my words to be misconstrued as a plea for attention,” said the Dylan Thomas prize nominee and later judge, with amusement in his voice!
It was on his way to judge the prize (2016) that he happened to watch the movie on the flight and it was only after disembarking did he google “Kapoor & Sons + Land Where I Flee” and couldn’t help but be shocked by the number of comments that popped up on social media platform like YouTube where users had extensively made the same connection!

“It was also around the same time that I discovered the ‘others’ folder on Facebook and saw multiple messages from people stating the same thing!” he said.
Even the use of the name Nicki is unavoidable where the author plays on the name suggesting that it’s a girl till one comes across the line in the book which says ‘Well you see, Nicholas Zachary is a man’ and for those who have watched the movie, the similarity wouldn’t be lost out. “There is class, sexuality, gender, caste in the conversations and everything else you can think of. It’s a fun book,” said the author of this really special book that is bound to continue to create more ripples in the future, having already been translated into multiple languages since its launch. Self-admittedly not so adept at the French language, Parajuly has read the translation in its entirety. He may not be working on another book currently and is instead busy being lazy in the lockdown, but we can’t wait to see what the author has to offer next to his readers, as his last book fights it out in the finals of the Emile Guimet Prize 2020.",culture
MTV Video Music Awards wears a dystopian look as stars rock the show," Call it a show highlighting optimism and resilience of the human spirit or an effort to iterate the age-old saying, “the show must go on”, MTV Video Music Awards took place on Sunday night with performances being pre-taped or staged at different locations across New York City. The show moved between being wow and eerie. While host Keke Palmer tried to keep the proceedings light, the animated backdrops had hordes of faceless audience members, which made one wonder if MTV got it right. Lately, a lot of big tech shows have happened virtually but instead of bringing in virtual crowds, companies have shot the proceedings in empty stadiums. The pretend crowd was somewhat unsettling. Nonetheless, MTV tried to do something innovative, something dystopian and has probably set the tone for other award shows in the coming months.

1. One for the books
Lady Gaga’s performance was the energy shot that was required to get the week started. She performed a medley of songs from her album Chromatica, including 911, Rain on Me and Stupid Love. It was instantly one for the books. Her performance begins in a bedroom where an old VMA preview plays on the TV. She leaves the bedroom, showing off her purple bondage bikini. Making past a stripper pole, she joins her dancers for 911, which transitions into Rain on Me on which Ariana Grande joins in. The performance ends with Gaga at a pink piano for Stupid Love. And the mask she wore will become a fashion statement. 2. Dazzling fireworks
The show kicked off with a clip of The Weeknd. The singer is first seen passed-out in a selfie-style recorded clip and then comes some dazzling fireworks and a helicopter, following the singer around at the Edge at Hudson Yards, which is one of the world’s most popular outdoor sky decks. What followed was a near-perfect rendition of Blinding Lights. According to reports, The Weeknd had filmed his performance last week.

3. Tay, the director
Taylor Swift will always be there… somewhere! The singer made her directorial debut with the music video The Man for the track off her 2019 album, Lover. It’s about how easy life becomes without the “weight of systemic misogyny”. She took home the award for Best Direction. In her selfie-shot acceptance speech, she thanked everyone who helped with the video’s production. 4. Dynamite of a show
Among the better performances of the night was that of K-pop sensation BTS, which performed in front of a green screened backdrop of some New York locations — the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square and the Empire State Building. Taking the stage in suits and ties, the group was all about turning in a high-energy performance of Dynamite. Towards the end of the performance fireworks appeared behind the group to complement the lyrics: So I’m-a light it up like dynamite.

5. Burning down the house
MTV VMAs lived up to its out-of-the-box reputation by bringing in the Black Eyed Peas, complete with glowing crotches. Yes, you read that right! They performed Vida Loca from their latest album, Translation, with help from Tyga, and a sky-sized projection of Nicky Jam. But all focus was on Will.I.Am, Taboo and Apl.De.Ap’s pants that seemed to have light-up zippers. They also performed I Gotta Feeling. 6. Concert feel
It’s been a while since we saw a real concert. Machine Gun Kelly’s VMAs pre-show performance gave us the feel of a mini concert as he performed two songs — atop a New York City rooftop — from his upcoming album Tickets to My Downfall. He played My Ex’s Best Friend with Blackbear on a rooftop during the day and Bloody Valentine with Travis Barker from a different building at night.

7. ‘Rest In Power’
The life of Chadwick Boseman, who passed away last week, was celebrated. “The world needs more superheroes,” a title card read at the beginning of the segment and then a clip of the actor accepting the Best Hero award at the 2018 MTV Movie and TV Awards played out. During the 2018 show, Boseman presented his trophy to James Shaw Jr., a real-life hero who stopped a gunman at a Waffle House in Tennessee after he killed several people. Host Keke Palmer said the 2020 show was dedicated to Boseman who was “a true hero, not just on screen but in everything he did”. The video tribute ended with the words: “Rest In Power.”

8. Finding her space
Miley Cyrus’ first live performance of Midnight Sky was full of energy. The song, reportedly inspired by her break-up with ex-husband Liam Hemsworth, seamlessly moved into a visual reminder of the video for Wrecking Ball as the singer climbed a staircase towards a disco ball and then sat on it. In an interview with Billboard, the former Disney Channel star has said that Midnight Sky is about finding personal independence.",culture

The virtual world of Valaya," For JJ Valaya, fashion is as much about all things sartorial as it is about romance and oodles of oomph. In fact, “romance” is a word that he repeats thrice during our chat on the eve of the fashion designer launching his website in the form of valaya.com. But that’s not a word of common parlance while talking about the mundane business of e-commerce, right? Wrong, when the website belongs to Valaya who has championed the cause of maximalism for posterity. “I feel very happy when I think that when the Internet first came to the world in the early 90s, we were amongst the first designers to actually create a website.
E-commerce did not exist then so it was purely informational. Over a passage of time, we focused more on real-time stores and the website had taken a back seat,” recounted Valaya.
Perhaps what helped in retaining his brand’s charm virtually as well is the fact that this all-encompassing website was scheduled for release in August, even before the Covid scheme of things hit us. “We had to push back the launch of the World of JJ Valaya — our physical experiential platform but the website was always scheduled for August and I am glad we could stick to that,” he explained.
So what can be expected from valaya.com? “The website is essentially an experiential space and it’s not about selling clothes only — in fact, I find that very disturbing. Earlier, people used to go through the romance of actually discovering a brand and then bought things if they wanted to. I didn’t want my website to be about click and pan straight to the shopping page. While we are, of course, very aggressively looking to expand on the e-commerce platform, we have also kept the romance of the brand alive so that one can actually go through the legacy and see what had happened over the years that have gone by. The website is highly experiential, very user-friendly and eventually, sales-driven because to make the brand reach far and wide is what the whole endeavour is about. Apart from the e-commerce bit, there’s also a good set-up for making both physical and virtual appointments,” the designer said. Exclusives like the Jhalamand House, which has the Valaya staple classic men’s shirts and a younger sibling to their signature couture Alika jackets, called the Ika, are available on the website. Interestingly, the Ika is available in a cool DIY format with a set of prints, colours, embroideries and pipings available to switch things up. This DIY format for the said younger sibling of the couture Alika begged the question of whether relinquishing this control to wearers made the designer nervous? “Not at all! Within the Ika itself, you have been given enough defining parameters yet you are free enough. After that, what you choose to wear it with is really your business and most people try to cultivate their personal individual identity with it and that’s what I am hoping for. Ika was meant to be a little more fun and I want young girls to pick it up and wear it over denims or over a gown or a sari. The versatility that I could create with a single piece of garment that is timeless was what was exciting to me and that was my intent with the Alika anyway, much like the Chanel tweed jacket,” came the reply.
Alongside these exclusives, one can also find the designer’s couture pieces from last year’s Tabriz and seasonal adaptations of staples such as the Chevron and the Valaya accessories line, including his collaboration with Swarovski. For the new Phoenix Belt, the designer has pulled out his sketchbooks from his days spent at the National Institute of Fashion Technology, where he had first designed a logo for himself and then did not end up using it, until now. Though a standalone for now, the belt uses this symbol on a gold-plated buckle, along with a high-quality leather to complete the look.   For the designer who has spent more than three decades in the industry, the lockdown has been a fruitful period as he got to spend time with his daughters and also finish designing new collections for both fashion and his furniture lines. While the pandemic brought with it a renewed shift of focus and vigour towards slow and sustainable fashion, Valaya has been doing exactly this from the get-go. “The buzzword appearing everywhere now is that of sustainability and there’s been a slowing down and a focus instead on high-quality clothes. My reply to that is that’s exactly what we have been doing from Day One. We have only made high-quality clothes and we do not get into the rut of making a fast buck — that’s not been us. We have been at a leisurely pace, and we have clients of ours from 26 years ago coming back with their daughters who want the same clothes altered to their sizes. So when you stand the test of time, it’s clear that you had a sustainability model existing before it became a fashionable word today,” is the designer’s take on things.
Always proudly Indian and steeped in heritage, Valaya stands by his tag line of “The Royal Nomad” as he said, “We have always been very strong advocates of the absolutely stunning country we live in and I have continued to believe in that. Our tag line holds true because we travel in our minds, in our books, our research and physically, into lands that have a rich past and craft, and then we combine that with our Indian signature and create something new.”
What can be expected next from the artsy world of Valaya is, in fact, the physical testament of his world — World of JJ Valaya, which will encompass all of his artistic pursuits under one roof, wrapped in a stylish experiential package, a la Valaya style. “It’s in the making now as we did not want to launch it this year but it will in 2021 and one can expect all things Valaya packaged as a memorable experience,” he signed off.",culture
"A powwow with Bhuvan Bam, the funny man in BB ki Vines"," Most of you know him as the man behind Banchoddas, Sameer Fuddi, Titu Mama and Mr. Hola with BB ki Vines but Bhuvan Bam’s musical journey started way before his Vines. From playing gigs at a restaurant in Delhi to releasing his seventh single, Heer ranjha, he sure has come a long way. The July 12 release has around 14 million views on YouTube and also made it to number one on iTunes. The musician and comedian based in Delhi with 18.9 million subscribers spoke to The Telegraph about his new single and skits.

Congratulations on Heer ranjha making it to #1 across charts on iTunes, beating BTS and Maroon 5 in an hour of its release. Did you expect the song to reach such a high?
It has always been my dream to make music that reflects my true emotions. Music is something I’ve always wanted to do and I’m really excited that it’s happening. The response from the listeners came as a surprise. We obviously put our hearts and souls into making the song but when you receive such validation it is truly inspiring.

The video is about an unfinished love story between a couple, who are not together. Where does the story stem from?
The idea basically came from the thought of not being able to meet and spend time with your loved ones. All my songs are inspired by real-life experiences. I started writing Heer ranjha while being stuck at home due to the pandemic. It was truly about expressing nostalgia, about looking back at a better and happier time.

The sound is very mellow and calm. How would you describe the song sonically?
The music of Heer ranjha is my kind of music and in a way describes me. I prefer music that is very soulful and deep, the kind of lyrics that I am drawn to, that I can listen to for days on end. It has the kind of music that does justice to me as an artiste. It took about 10 days to make the song. Is that the amount of time your team and you normally take to work on a track?
It was very different for Heer ranjha as this was the first song we made since the lockdown. Yes, it took us 10 days to develop this finished product over video calls from our respective homes. And it wouldn’t have been possible if not for the amazingly talented Shadab Rayeen and Omkar Tamhan and the entire team.

The video is inspiring. What is the idea behind it?
I am always drawn to soulful music. With Heer ranjha, since the initial stage, the thought was to tell a story and to tell it in the most soothing way. Even though we chose to go with an animated video, it was important to make sure it connects with our audiences. Set against planets and stars, with floating lyrics, it did complete justice to the lyrics, music and the emotions behind it.

Would this song be a part of any upcoming album or EP? Or do you have other singles coming up?
I am not really focusing on an album right now. The idea is to just put out singles supported by music videos.

Before BB ki Vines you’d play gigs at different restaurants. Could you describe how the gigs used to be back then?
While in college,  I worked as a singer at a Mughlai restaurant in Delhi. Music always came naturally to me. Before I got into making Vines, music is where all my focus was. Gigs back then were pretty new to me. The interaction with the audience and to keep them engaged was a tough job. With so many brilliant bands and artistes performing live, I understood the taste of people. I have observed many live gigs in order to learn crowd-wooing techniques and stage presence.

Tell us the story about the rise to fame... of BB ki Vines.
Becoming a YouTuber, making funny sketches had never even crossed my mind. A few years ago, I thought of a joke and shared it with the world. I did not even know that just about anyone can put videos on YouTube. I used to share small sketches on Facebook and then someone told me to switch to YouTube, gradually people started following my videos on YouTube. It’s still amusing how my sketch went viral without having done any promotions or spent any money on it. I had some jokes in mind and I just did it for fun. I never realised when this became a full-time profession. With BB kiVines, I started off randomly and just went with the flow, without thinking it’ll be something I’m going to pursue as a career. And it has been a roller coaster ride since then. I was patient enough and knew that sooner or later, I would get what I was looking for.

What inspires the plot, story, and characters of your different skits?
The characters are the basis of mere observations. I observe people around me and spend a considerable amount of time thinking about them and their way of talking. Then it all combines with exaggerated middle-class comedy where I take inspiration from my own family. If — in some situation — I make a funny remark and it works, I make a note of it and use it for my scripts. I also try to stay updated with current affairs and trending topics and try and draw something funny from them. I believe in investing time in creating relevant and quality content and that is why I never rush into making a video.

What do your parents think when they watch you playing the role of a parent in your videos?
My parents were triggered initially because they thought I was portraying them ‘dumb’ in front of the world. But I had to convince them that all the characters in my universe are fictional. They still doubt that though!

Shorter skits and videos seem to hold the attention of a viewer more than long ones. Do you agree?
Short format videos are doing amazingly well and have become quite popular recently. But it’s only good content and interesting subjects that will get you viewers. My videos are not very long but there are enough punchlines and crisp jokes. Scripting isn’t easy. I script, rewrite, and rewrite again. Audiences are very smart today and know exactly what they want. If the content isn’t funny, my audience won’t like it.",culture
"Good Bye, Bad Bye"," A funeral has always been a community thing. Rows of people in white standing around, family members meeting after so long that you don’t recognise the strapping young man next to you as the son of a favourite cousin. Casual acquaintances and neighbours stand on the fringes with long faces though they may not have known the dear departed at all. In all likelihood, there will be an aunt, who you can barely tolerate, lamenting long and loud. A nosy relation with a disapproving expression will be spouting much talk about how things are done in “our family”. I say, “Oh really? And where exactly is this family in any time of need?” but only in my head.
Funerals make me weep, yes, but usually tears of exasperation. I never thought I would miss not having a funeral for anybody. Yet when Covid-19 robbed me of a fond brother-in-law, it also stole my right — and that of many others — to closure and a proper send-off.
His wife, my sister-in-law, broke down when she couldn’t touch him for the last time; he had already been wrapped in plastic. She just stood quietly and wrapped her arms around herself.
The nieces complained bitterly that he had again cheated them of their right to touch his feet — he never did hold with that tradition. I stood some distance away — 12 feet to be precise — from them all, unable to do any of those things one normally does to convey support, offer comfort.
Comfort, did I say? That day, every gesture, every action of mine seemed to do anything but. A short while before, I had called the other sister-in-law and her elderly husband and forbade them from coming to the hospital. Said the elder sister, “I can’t even stand by her now when she needs me most?

What kind of a sister does that make me?” The kind, retorted her brother, who would stay alive.
It is very typical of eastern cultures to not grieve alone. And I am not talking about funerals but the entire duration of grieving. There is always someone aflutter with concern — making sure you eat, sleep, cry and talk and listen, coaxing the disjointed mind, body and soul to come together once again. But this time a virus kept all well-wishers away. Physically away, that is.
I have lost count of the number of calls I had to field — that was the only comfort I could provide my sister-in-law who could not take calls. The callers conveyed their condolences, expressed shock at his sudden demise, remembered him and his help with gratitude or just wanted to talk about what a fine man he was. At any other time, many of these people would have made it a point to be present at his funeral. And that is what I was thinking as we, his immediate family, waited to see him one last time.
Only four people would be allowed to see him off to the hospital door. The rest of us were outside the hospital because we could not bear to be anywhere else. We would have huddled together but Covid restrictions meant we were a line of stragglers. A day later, a cousin who had driven for more than two hours to offer the bereaved support had to be satisfied with a glimpse of her beloved sister at her first-floor window. She did not get to see the brother-in-law she had so adored.
The big man — in every sense — with the cheeky grin and crazy hair set out on his final journey in the KMC-provided hearse. The same big man who bought me something elegant and expensive every Puja because a catty relation had once remarked on the poverty of my wardrobe within his hearing. The man who had put more children through school than I can count on all my fingers and cringed every time someone mentioned it, who preferred staying home with a book over all else, who loved pulling people’s legs in private but had a very reserved public persona, who put family above all else and principles over them too. That day, he who was never really comfortable in the company of strangers left with four total strangers in PPE suits.
Soon after, my sister-in-law donned widow’s weeds ignoring all urgings to the contrary — there is only so much you can do over the phone.
Worried friends and family left meals outside her door. Neighbours, acquaintances and well-wishers too had the same idea. She finally turned on her phone after a whole week to call her brother — to come and rescue her from the avalanche of fruits outside her door.",culture
Dreams die first," On Republic Day this year, a second-year undergraduate student of history at Visva-Bharati was expelled from the Purba Palli Senior Boys’ Hostel for videographing vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty’s speech. Wall. Soon after, a student from Bangladesh received a “leave India” notice for posting anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest photographs on social media. Wall. The erection of a boundary wall on the Poush Mela grounds. Definitely wall. Another one coming up inside the campus, near Sangeet Bhavana. Nine-foot wall.
Visva-Bharati alumnus and singer, composer, painter and former teacher of musicology at Sorbonne, France, Sharmila Roy Pommot says, “I mingle with the young. I notice there is a fear to voice their views. It is sad.”It is. To think the world over, Rabindranath Tagore is known for the lines, “Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high/Where knowledge is free/Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls...,” but in his own dream-yard a dystopia is assuming shape.
Roy Pommot, who is one of those end-to-end Visva-Bharati products — first batch of Ananda Pathshala, student of Patha Bhavana and Kala Bhavana — shares an anecdote from her schooldays. She says, “A classmate, a boy, slapped a teacher. Now, according to ashram rules, five students were to sit in judgement and decide the measure of punishment, in the presence of teachers. The boy, who was also our friend, was passionate about sports. We ruled that he be not allowed to play for a whole year.” Roy Pommot adds, “I have an idea how my friend would have felt had the punishment been awarded by a teacher. But the punishment possibly became a lesson for life as it came from some of his own.”
The anecdote has nothing to do with walls, or maybe it does, but it does illustrate what a long way Visva-Bharati has come from what Tagore imagined it to be. What a long way, and in what direction too! 
Nemai Sadhan Bose, who was the vice-chancellor in the 1980s, writes in his 1991 book Bhagnanir Visva-Bharati that Tagore was aware that ideological walls were silently coming up in the institution of his creation. Bose writes, “He refers to these in 1934, but accepts them as part of the natural process. Tagore says, ‘When I am not there, whatever emerges from the combined thinking of many minds will be the natural truth. What will be artificial is if any one person imposes his ideas and directives. The praandharma is to embrace all contrarian views and forge ahead’.”
One does not want to dare a metaphor to explain a poet’s imagination and yet like flowers to a tribute, only a metaphor will do. Visva-Bharati is a lot like a cell. A cell, as in the smallest unit of life, of random morphology, throbbing with mysterious workings, floating in cytoplasm, born of a hunger of the Universe, vital, possessed of the ability to multiply and become something beyond itself.  
Visva-Bharati was born in 1921, three years after World War I had ended. Says Uma Dasgupta, a historian and biographer of Tagore, “He was suffocated. He was not a free citizen in colonial India and on top of this, the war bothered him. He embarked on a world tour in 1916 as soon as he was allowed to travel. Nations cannot physically meet, but Tagore wanted that their people meet. He wanted to build a centre where the likeminded who were repelled by territorial and aggressive nationalism could come together and learn about each other’s histories and cultures.” She adds, “Visva-Bharati was his way of conflict resolution.”
The term Visva-Bharati means different things to different people. Some use it interchangeably with Santiniketan, a neighbourhood in Bengal’s Birbhum district. Some use it to refer to the university. Others extend the term beyond the institutes and centres of higher learning to embrace all the schools. Almost no one will use the term to mean Sriniketan — also known as the Institute of Rural Reconstruction — but the association remains. Lonely Planet describes it as “a nerve centre of Bengali culture”. VC Chakraborty has referred to it as “Birbhum’s only industry” in a letter dated July 4, 2020. To Roy Pommot, it is a “vidya-samabay” or cooperative education. “Tagore’s own expression,” she points out. And nearly everyone in Bengal can tell it is the name of the new political flashpoint in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections.
Tagore himself called it “a grand idea, which having assumed a modest form, has arrived in our ashram”.  
Visva-Bharati is possibly each of these, their sum total and more.
Visva-Bharati burgeoned. From what fourth-generation ashramik, Tagore researcher and assistant professor at Gushkara Mahavidyalaya Sukalyan Chanda says, it was a frenetic growth. He says, “There was Vidya Bhavana for scholarly research.”
He quotes a 1927 annual report that lists study in Vedic, Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Avesta, Tibetan, Buddhism, Jainism and Medieval religions. Shiksha Bhavana was then set up to train students for Calcutta University exams [in the initial years, there was a degree granting arrangement with CU]. Says Uma Dasgupta of Tagore’s effort, “He need not have done it, but he did it.”
Roy Pommot talks about her takeaways from the place — the open relationship between teachers and students, the approach to any thing or subject — beginning with a sense of history and journeying to an open ending, shot through with analytical thinking. She asks, “Do you know that in 1921, Gurudev had over at Visva-Bharati (French Indologist) Sylvain Levi? Levi taught Sanskrit and his classes were compulsory for all. Even Gurudev and Kshiti Dadu (Sanskrit scholar Kshitimohan Sen) attended his class.”
Sanjeeda Khatun arrived from Bangladesh in 1954 as a master’s student. She remembers the strictures of ashram life. “Walking barefoot, it was painful,” she says. She recalls the gathering of foreign students at the home of her local guardian, poet and essayist Annada Shankar Ray. Shyamal Chanda, who was a student in the mid-1960s, says, “I realise that Santiniketan has made me secular.” Sudripto Tagore, batch of 1985, talks about the “natural environment”. “It teaches sensitivity,” he says. Shikha Majumdar, who did her master’s in history in 1999, says, “I remember the lal maati (red earth), the pathways lined with sonajhuri trees on either side. They filled me with a sense of freedom.”
Abhinandan Sen from the class of 2007 brings up the issue of an increasing number of “external students”. He says, “Earlier, five students in a class of 30 were outsiders; now the ratio is 50:50.” There is a hint that the altered student composition has resulted in a dilution of ethos. Mohammed Badshah Alam, a 2016 graduate, says, “Walls have come up everywhere… There was a time when we could freely walk into the university, we could use the roads and shortcuts. Even in 2013, the Sangeet Bhavana did not have a gate. Now there are gates everywhere.”
If you must understand why any physical wall is inimical to the very idea of Visva-Bharati, the answer lies in the nature of the university complex.
The herring-shaped map on the university website has coloured dots denoting university and office buildings scrambled across large tracts of yellow representing the many acres that constitute the Visva-Bharati complex. At the herring’s mouth is Sriniketan, one of the dots on its tail is Vinaya Bhavana, the teachers’ training centre. Below the head are Pearson Palli, Andrews Palli, Sripalli, further down there is Ratan Palli, Aban Palli, still further down there is Purba Palli — all residential areas. Rabindrasangeet exponent Santidev Ghosh’s house is in Sripalli right in front of Sangeet Bhavana, Kshitimohan Sen’s house is also there, painter and sculptor K.G. Subramanyan’s house is in Purba Palli.
In a 2011 article published in Anandabazar, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen writes, “Visva-Bharati’s right to the land is undeniable and the university authorities’ need to safeguard it is perfectly legitimate. After the theft of Tagore’s Nobel medal, the need for enhanced security is natural.” The economist then asks, “But will these ugly concrete walls serve the purpose? Is there really a case for having high walls that will disrupt the cadence of ashram life? And wall in learning?”
Ashramik Subir Banerjee shares a copy of a 2010 letter to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Signed by aggrieved ashramiks, it reads, “Tagore had distinguished Visva-Bharati by two core features, one, the institution will mingle with nature and environment in a boundless way and second, it will interact with its human surroundings…” The letter draws attention to the fact that the high walls obstruct vision, passage of light and air, impede movement of vehicles, fire brigade, etc. Following this, the then Bengal Governor M.K. Narayanan conducted an enquiry and among other things stipulated a permissible wall height. No one says anything about looking into the reduced influx of foreign students, identifying areas of new research, a robust exchange programme or other things academic.
After Tagore’s death in 1941, the walls multiplied. In his 1994 book Shesh Paranir Kori, scholar Hirendranath Dutta writes, “Santiniketan was the first attempt at establishing a more or less egalitarian society in India. After Tagore, Santiniketan had to journey in the footsteps of others. Tagore’s Visva-Bharati became a central university in 1951. Soon after, cracks appeared in Tagore’s egalitarian experiment.” He said cracks, you might hear walls.
According to Nemai Sadhan Bose, the biggest change Visva-Bharati had to grapple with was politicisation. He writes, “Whenever a new VC is appointed, his political affiliation becomes the point of discussion and scrutiny, more than his academic and administrative merits.” Another wall.
From the sound of it, Visva-Bharati also walled itself out from the world. “There was growth if you mean additions to departments, but was it taking forward Tagore’s vision, I cannot say,” asks Supriyo Tagore, erstwhile principal of Patha Bhavana and great grandson of Tagore’s second brother, Satyendranath. He continues almost stoically, trailing off in places, “As Visva-Bharati grew it became unwieldy, overcrowded… It was meant to be a meeting place of the East and West, a place of research. When Tagore was alive, a lot of people came from all over to study and to teach, that could not be sustained.”
Young researcher Sukalyan says, “There are continuities and discontinuities.”
To be noted — by all and wall.",culture
No full stops," “Amma then spent decades on the fringe, a renegade lobbing hand grenades at the establishment that excluded her
until the mainstream began to absorb what was once radical and she found herself hopeful of joining it”

That was Bernardine Evaristo in a moment of unknowing self-fulfilling prophesy as her eighth book Girl, Woman, Other won the Booker Prize 2019 (jointly with Margaret Atwood), making her the first Black woman in the award’s history.
Now 61 years old, Evaristo’s first book was published when she was 34. The author was a theatre student at the Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance, London, and later went on to launch her own theatre company with extensive ideas for people of colour. She is now a professor of creative writing at Brunel University, London, and vice-chair of the Royal Society of Literature.
The narratives of Evaristo and her character Amma align as the book begins with a radical Amma landing a gig at the National (Theatre London). Tracing the life of 12 distinctly different Black women whose narratives, lived experiences and lineage are more than often subtly interconnected, Evaristo’s book is a mellifluous series of opportunities — to understand, learn, observe and grow.
Speaking to The Telegraph over the phone one fine Wednesday evening, Bernardine Evaristo deep-dived into reserving judgements as a writer and questions of privilege.
Evaristo started writing when she was at drama school. Having grown up in the suburbs of London in a mixed-racial family of eight, books soon became a window to the outside world. Born to a Nigerian father and an English mother, she remembers her surroundings being a “very white area” and using reading as an escape.
“I began reading as soon as I could. I couldn’t afford too many books, so I was initially a big library visitor which later became second-hand bookshops, as I got older. Books were my main form of entertainment, other than youth theatre, and books brought the world into my little life, to be honest, expanded my imagination, intellect and vocabulary,” said the author.
This love for books naturally turned its course towards writing when she was majoring in plays and every student of theatre was encouraged to write their own. What started as poetry at 19, continued throughout the 20s and was eventually published as Island of Abraham (1994).

“ageing is nothing to be ashamed of
      especially when the entire human race is in it together”

In the book, Amma and her break into the National is celebrated and vilified by various characters as the author contemplates the concept of age, which is a recurring thought in her mind as well for having won the Booker at a point in life that she considers ‘late’. It lends an air of surrealism to the entire event.
“People often break through when they are much younger, especially writers, by their first or second book. Even Hilary Mantel, when she won the Booker for Wolf Hall, was probably 10 years younger than I am I think — a middle-aged woman, but still younger. For this to happen to me at such an age is a phenomenal experience and one that I am incredibly grateful for. I am just enjoying it and taking every opportunity that comes my way, because I value it so much.”
Writing, experimenting and creating for the self, her ideas have a purpose but never a defined audience. “It (the Booker prize) has opened my writing up to the world. Not just this country, but the world and, as a writer, you want the world to read what you are writing. We want our writings to be read at a macro scale and winning the prize has done just that for me,” she adds.
There are 12 characters in Girl, Woman, Other that you grow to love, hate or form indifferent opinions about. Evaristo had famously said that she had wanted 100 characters to be in this book but stopped at 12! Was there ever a thought of expanding upon any of the characters in a longer format or the oft-experienced ominous feeling among artists for possibly putting ‘too many eggs in the same basket’?
“I feel that I have gone into the lives of my characters in as much depth as I wanted to. Even though they have 30 pages each, you still get a strong sense of who they are and the purpose of the novel was to explore womanhood through as many characters as possible rather than to dig deeper and be more comprehensive in each individual storyline. As a writer, I have so many more stories to tell and they will not be about these women,” she adds.
A poignant tale in its own right, Girl, Woman, Other reads like an observational piece sans any judgement. There is disassociation in documentation without compromising on the depth of emotions. “Yes, yes! That is a really good observation because that is what I do as a writer. I reserve my judgements because my job is to bring them alive in the most interesting and humane way possible. That means that they are their own creations and they must not be suppressed by my opinions,” she agrees.
Not imposing your personal politics on your characters is something she teaches her students of creative writing. The idea is to create a complex, complete, flawed individual who will have many sides to them. “Maybe some of their behaviour is unpalatable to you or that you don’t morally agree with it, but that doesn’t mean you should pre-judge it because if you do you will only end up with two-dimensional characters. In a way, you are going to force-feed the character to your readers with your judgements. And what the reader wants to do is make up their own mind. So, definitely, when I am writing all my books, I am allowing them to be who they are. Of course, they are my creations but I am allowing them to have a life of their own,” she adds. “If I imposed my personal politics on my characters, the book wouldn’t exist because they’d all be feminists (laughs),” the feminist author declares about her book where some of the characters are not.
There are two distinctly different schools of writers. The likes of Howard Jacobson and Leila Slimani, who begin writing from an idea and let the story take its course. Then there is the other school that has an Elizabeth Gilbert or a Yann Martel, who plan and note down their research before beginning to pen the story. Evaristo self-admittedly belongs to the first school as she tells us how her story began from “Carol, whose daily lexicon revolves around the orbit of equities, futures and financial modelling”, and she led to Bummi and her mother and from there arrived LaTisha and, subsequently, Amma, Yazz and Dominique.
“I didn’t sit down with a plan of writing about 12 characters, but I was aware that they all had to be of different ages, generations even, and they needed to have a different relationships to class and sexualities and occupations…. That was really important because I didn’t want to say that all of these women were straight, as that wouldn’t be true to life, and I also didn’t want it to be a token gesture of sexuality, which is why a quarter of them are in the queer spectrum. So, these were things I was figuring out as I kept writing, but I definitely didn’t sit down with a plan,” she says.
One of the the most striking elements of the novel is the form and structure of language, used sparingly in her last book. “Maybe some of their behaviour is unpalatable to you or that you don’t morally agree with it, but that doesn’t mean you should pre-judge it because if you do you will only end up with two-dimensional characters. In a way, you are going to force-feed the character to your readers with your judgements. And what the reader wants to do is make up their own mind. So, definitely, when I am writing all my books, I am allowing them to be who they are. Of course, they are my creations but I am allowing them to have a life of their own,” she adds. “If I imposed my personal politics on my characters, the book wouldn’t exist because they’d all be feminists (laughs),” the feminist author declares about her book where some of the characters are not.

Evaristo self-admittedly belongs to the first school as she tells us how her story began from “Carol, whose daily lexicon revolves around the orbit of equities, futures and financial modelling”, and she led to Bummi and her mother and from there arrived LaTisha and, subsequently, Amma, Yazz and Dominique.
“I didn’t sit down with a plan of writing about 12 characters, but I was aware that they all had to be of different ages, generations even, and they needed to have a different relationships to class and sexualities and occupations…. That was really important because I didn’t want to say that all of these women were straight, as that wouldn’t be true to life, and I also didn’t want it to be a token gesture of sexuality, which is why a quarter of them are in the queer spectrum. So, these were things I was figuring out as I kept writing, but I definitely didn’t sit down with a plan,” she says.
One of the the most striking elements of the novel is the form and structure of language, used sparingly in her last book before this one, Mr. Loverman, one that she terms as ‘fusion fiction’. There are no full stops and the sentences ride into each other in fluidic movements, creating a cadence of thoughts. Using the silences caused by the use of abundant space in each page, she succinctly used pauses and silences to speak more about the characters than words could have achieved.
“It was creatively liberating to get rid of the full stops. I think I invented the term ‘fusion fiction’ and nobody has told me I haven’t! It is fusion fiction not just for the absence of full stops, which makes the sentences, paragraphs and clauses merge into each other. It is also fusion fiction because the stories are fused together. There is nothing traditional, it’s very experimental. It gives a sense of a whole story but what actually happens is that you are just floating around into the minds and lives of these characters. I don’t think I would have been able to do this if I had written traditional sentences and paragraphs because it would have constrained me,” she says. Checking of one’s privilege is an internal process, and very rarely is it pointed out successfully from the outside. 

The concept of privilege can’t be simplified, the author feels, while creating a character like Yazz who pontificates on it extensively to whoever is willing to listen. “I find the idea of racial privilege very interesting because I understand the definition of it. There is a hierarchy of privileges, and when people talk about white privilege, they are often referring to white privilege as the most predominant and important privilege in society. When in reality, there is caste privilege, privilege of sexuality and so much more,” says Evaristo.
Is it this need for dogmatism and rigidity of thought in the name of ‘calling out’ culture that leads to people being ‘cancelled’ on social media terms? “When you have people cancelling other people, they are challenging them and their opinions. That should be a good thing, but if it becomes a shouting match or trolling, it doesn’t help anyone. We want debate, we want argument, we want to communicate and to understand each other’s viewpoints. But people tend to get too angry.”
It can well be argued, in retrospect, that a photograph of a protest march in 1982 in Brick Lane, London, can be mistaken for one in the US in 2020, if one looks past sartorial choices and sepia tones. This ‘anger’ has persisted and the conversations somehow remain the same. So has nothing really changed, we ask the author who has spent decades ‘in the fringes’ fighting the good fight.
“I think so much has changed, but we haven’t changed enough as a society. When I was growing up, there were no Black or Brown politicians in government and there were hardly any people of colour on television. People could openly be racist and get away with it because it was before the Race Relations Act (of 1965). We have made huge strides in many affairs, but there are still lots of problems such as young people of colour who are disproportionately arrested and sent to prison. We have a society where on the one hand we can see all these social developments, we have become more understanding of our differences, or even things like Gay Pride, which wouldn’t have been part of conversations in the ’70s but can now be enjoyed even by people who are not gay; but it’s still not enough. The relationships between Black people and the police continues to be problematic,” she adds.
The author misses her social life during this lockdown, stepping out to shop or meet up with people or attend events, while also simultaneously enjoying the solitary time. “I have enjoyed the quiet and lack of pollution, but I miss having my life back,” she ruminates. Exercising, eating and writing till 9pm takes up most of her day and she is reading The Lie of the Land by Amanda Craig right now and mentions The Vanishing Half by Britt Bennett as a standout read of the lockdown.
The only time we feel a chink in her armour of positivity is the mention of the future of theatre. “The daunting part is that a lot of these theatre houses might not survive this pandemic. That’s the worry. It’s probably true to say that a lot of them will go down,” said the theatre enthusiast in Evaristo, while hoping for a vaccine.
As we ask her about the television and film rights to the novel, her positivity is back as she talks of the deal that has been “signed and sealed but not delivered yet!” She may not be sure that it will eventually get made but “one can still get excited”, she laughingly adds!
We wind up the conversation by asking her if she experiences any added pressure after the Booker for her next book. “Up until now I was saying that there is no pressure, I am just going to write what I was going to write. But the more people ask me, the more pressure I feel! I think the pressure is always going to be there but I am just going to ignore it,” she ends with a hearty laugh.",culture
"A talk on sustaining fashion, and its future in the wake of the pandemic"," The Calcutta chapter of the Indian Women Network (IWN) under the aegis of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) held an all-encompassing webinar on fashion recently, titled Reweaving Fashion, where relevant members of the industry chipped in with their inputs.

Handloom & sustainability
Comprising two sessions, the first one saw Mayukhi Basak of Biswa Bangla, Malavika Banerjee of Byloom and Siva Devireddy of GoCoop.com weigh in on the handloom aspect of the industry and what they are doing to make the weavers and looms benefit from their sales through a combination of help from the state, private marketing and techno-commerce. While Basak praised the weavers for staying in touch with them via WhatsApp through the pandemic and therefore, accentuated the importance of technology in the industry and the need to educate all stakeholders in it, Malavika emphasised on the importance of communicating to the public facts like why a handloom sari in person might look different from its picture. Devireddy added value to the conversation with his expertise in the field of connecting craft clusters across the country with technology.

The future of luxury
The second session saw designers Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Nil (of DevRNil) talk about how they, as designer labels, dealt with the crisis and the future of luxury fashion as they saw it.
“After April and May, June was better but when I say ‘better’, it’s a fraction of a fraction of what we are used to. I don’t think we are going back to the kind of sales we had for a long time,” said Kiran, giving a perspective on how business has taken a hit. “Any fashion brand is completely dependent on their workforce and we had to make sure that they were taken care of, which was a big ask from private entrepreneurs,” said Nil. Kiran also acknowledged the difficulty of ensuring awareness about the pandemic amongst members of the workforce who are from the hinterlands. Both agreed that the need of the hour was to put their respective people before profits to sustain their communities and to de-stigmatise Covid-19.
Faced with the twin problems of a pandemic and economic depression, the most important question that the fashion industry is plagued with at present is whether there will be buyers. “One of the ways in which I like to take control of my situation is to dress the way I usually do. I am not saying I will dress in a gold cape or something but just in terms of putting in the same efforts as I would if I had to go to office or meet a friend. I feel my small wardrobe that I have built and curated through the years has become my luxe armour. We are not talking about fancy clothes but clothes that remind you of who you used to be because life has changed and I like to believe that all women will feel like that at some level or the other. I am not talking about rushing out to buy new clothes but to buy good clothes,” explained Kiran. She also drew from her experience of recently seeing girls in a remote UP village dressed rebelliously in simple contemporary clothes amid a group of women in saris and ghunghats, while she was driving down to Delhi. “I feel that a woman who probably rebelled against her family to wear that pair of jeans and top, maybe after watching a Bollywood film, will continue to buy those clothes because they symbolise a sort of hope for her.”

Nil laid emphasis on the importance of pricing as he said that products needed to be toned down so that they can enter everyone’s wardrobes. “The pricing has to be competitive, justified and the designs need to be toned down to fit those budgets,” he added.
Both designers were of the opinion that physical retail vis-a-vis its online version was still very, if not more, relevant, even under the present circumstances, especially beyond a certain price point that demands the product be seen and felt.
Kiran pegged this time as a turning point forcing “designers and their audiences alike” in changing the way fashion is presented and consumed. “I don’t think physical fashion shows on the scale, numbers and magnitude that we have seen will return and I don’t think they should. It’s a good thing that this time is forcing people to sit up and rethink certain scales,” she added. Nil felt that an online showcase of fashion makes it “a bit more democratic” as it substituted the pomp with more relevant details.
Nil also addressed the lack of a helping hand to tide over the choppy waters as he said, “There was no response from the authorities for any direct help to the small businesses. So I’ll have to tell all entrepreneurs to set aside some rainy-day funds from every pay cheque because you are on your own.” He expressed hope for the younger generations to address it, perhaps in the form of a parallel body that could be more localised in their efforts to help the industry. Kiran, however, while agreeing with the need to set aside money for difficult situations, felt that it was a difficult time for everyone involved and not just the fashion industry. “It’s not like nothing is selling but buyers are more interested in value-for-money so we, as designers, have to innovate,” she said.
“At CII–IWN, West Bengal, it was imperative to have a discussion on the fashion sector amidst Covid-19 and its trajectory beyond because IWN is an organisation of women who are in the workforce or intend to be and the fashion sector engages a substantial number of women in its entire value chain, right from the artisans to the end consumers. Having said that, this sector is also certainly gender agnostic and we at IWN are always striving towards inclusion and diversity,” said CII-IWN chairperson Sucharita Basu, who was behind organising these sessions.",culture
Nature Morte & Vadehra Art Gallery come together to showcase the artists’ take on our future," Delhi’s Nature Morte and Vadehra Art Gallery have come together to present the works of 24 artists for a stellar online art showcase, aptly titled ‘The Future is Not Fixed’, which is available for viewing till September 20. Though part of the growing trend in the art world of going digital, with some of the biggest names in the industry already having set precedent, this joint art showcase that is curated by Arjun Sawhney marks the coming together of a set of very distinguished artists such as Bharti Kher, Subodh Gupta, Thukral and Tagra, Shilpa Gupta, Dhruvi Acharya, Anju Dodiya, Gigi Scaria and Jitish Kallat. “Man has always looked ahead. He has strived to make the coming time better than what it is today…. The reality though is that the coming time is more of a mystery than ever before. Very rarely, if ever, do things turn out the way we envisage them. Does this mean that we do not dream better dreams?” — Sawhney postulates in his curatorial note for the exhibition, pegging it in the reality of our present times. It is this chiaroscuro of the past, present and the future that this exhibition resides in as the artists explore the “elusive future”, which can hold promise but lies beyond an uncertain path that the human race must traverse. “In our pursuit of that elusive future, we had lost sight of the present; where we exist, how we live. And now in the span of a few months the future has been transformed from an uncertain to an unknown…. This period will go down in history. It will never be forgotten. It will be documented in umpteen ways and interpreted by visual artists in a million more. This show is an attempt to illustrate these feelings as we live through this point in history. This is the reality of today and this is the truth. The future is not fixed. Not at all any more,” adds Sawhney.",culture
Rewinding songs that have enjoyed a second life," The darkest, dankest song of the 1991 Nirvana album Nevermind — Something In The Way — is suddenly trending on social media, thanks to the trailer of The Batman that released on August 22. Over the years, many an iconic number has got a fresh lease of life courtesy films that have included them in their musical soundtracks (OSTs), and have used them in memorable scenes. Here is a list of a few of them, with the corresponding scenes where they were aptly used. I Started A Joke, the Bee Gees 1968 hit, used brilliantly in The Fighter (2010), in the scene where Christian Bale sings it to placate his mother, played by Melissa Leo and to hide his drug addiction from her. Melissa sings with him at the end of what is arguably the best scene of the film, and the one that unequivocally won Bale and Melissa the Oscars. That’s Life, the popular song of Dean Kay and Kelly Gordon, made famous by Frank Sinatra in 1966, features in the last scene of Joker (2019), when Joaquin Phoenix’s titular character finally makes peace with his troubled mind by going on a killing spree at Arkham asylum. The song serves as a perfect foil to a brilliant performance by Phoenix. When Margot Robbie’s titular character finally breaks out of her abusive marriage after she calls the cops on her husband, we hear Supertramp’s 1979 hit Goodbye Stranger in the background. Quite an apt song to complement the scene. One of the best title sequences of a superhero movie, this film uses Bob Dylan’s 1964 anthem for the only thing that is constant — The Times They Are A-Changin’. The sequence shows an alternative view of iconic moments of the 20th century, with Dylan’s song playing in the background. Tiny Dancer, Elton John’s famous 1972 hit, got a fresh boost when it featured in Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe’s 2000 comedy drama. The song plays in the background with members of the rock band Stillwater and their groupies on a bus, and one by one they sing along. Trainspotting, Danny Boyle’s 1996 black comedy hit, resurrected Lou Reed’s 1972 classic Perfect Day, and gave it cult status. The song plays in the background in the scene where Ewan Mcgregor’s Mark Renton injects a lethal dose of heroin in himself that nearly kills him. The song is construed to be an allegory of drug use, although in a radio interview in 2000, Reed dismissed any claim of his song romanticising or having anything to do with drug use, calling the theory laughable. Just before Jenny boards the bus, Forrest gives her his medal of honour. Jenny asks him: “Why are you so good to me?” Forrest replies in his inimitable matter-of-fact way: “Cause you are my girl!” Jenny gets on the bus, waves goodbye to him and flashes the peace sign. Forrest reciprocates and The Byrds’ 1965 rendition of Pete Seeger’s plea for world peace, Turn! Turn! Turn!, plays in the background. One of the many memorable moments of an outstanding film with a brilliant OST.

Decoding e-commerce — the buzzword in the world of fashion right now," Sabeer Bhatia. Bill Gates. Nandan Nilekani. Mark Zuckerberg. Names a generation grew up on. Names who bet on the digital universe much before people could spell Internet, the only living reality of these unreal times. They had foreseen a web revolution and the birth of a global village. This pandemic they stand vindicated. Like Spider-Man, we are trying to navigate this vast intangible yet throbbing-with-vigour universe called the web. Mining it is a plethora of players with retail being at the forefront. One of the hardest hit, the fashion industry has taken the challenge, with the web emerging as a saviour with its Midas touch and birthing the e-commerce resuscitation. The Telegraph reached out to a bunch of designers and a fashion store to find out the whys, yays and nays of e-commerce. Delhi-based designer Rahul Mishra — with 11 years of his brand, 11 seasons of Paris Fashion Week and two seasons of Haute Couture (Paris) behind him — had been thinking of e-commerce for the last three years. He finally launched www.rahulmishra.in in July with his Haute Couture online show (with Federation De La Haute Couture Et De La Mode, Paris) where he showcased his couture fall 2020/21 line — Butterfly People — through a 7.20-minute video. “There was so much going on that I never got a pause to be able to focus on this. We work with a lot of stores across the globe. Everywhere the pricing is different, but on an
e-commerce platform you need to have an international pricing which needs to be unanimous and that would have harmed the interest of a lot of our other buyers. But eventually one day, this had to happen. Showcasing at Haute Couture gave me that chance. It is a craftsmanship that probably a few stores from one country will be able to carry the brand. So, in that respect, it gave me far more confidence to go for a direct-to-consumer approach. The pandemic acted as a catalyst to it,” he told t2. Chhatarpur-based designer Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango “expedited the launch due to the sudden and prolonged closure of business and operations”. The brand launched shop.rawmango.com mid-July.
Veteran Calcutta-based sleepwear and resort wear designer Suman Nathwani who has been designing for 33 years, had put it off primarily because of the nature of what she designs. “The major reason why I was reluctant was that this space of sleepwear and lingerie is a very personal and intimate space, filled with romance and love. This is the only piece of clothing one wears for themselves or their partner and therefore I always believed in understanding the need of my clients. Plus, the touch-and-feel factor was also always there. The one major reason why I always held back was the entire concept of returns, which never really justified the hygiene aspect of our industry. How can one exchange or return something that is so intimate to wear? For me lingerie and sleepwear is second skin and you cannot compromise on that,” said Suman who launched sumannathwani.com in July.
Though the thought was always there, “average response” online was also a deterrent. “We were already selling our nightwear through a partnered vendor on Amazon and their website and our Resort Wear through leading designer store e-com channels. The response had been average on these platforms and brick-and-mortar was working perfectly well for us, so at that moment I did not put much attention and focus on the website to sell my products,” she added. The pandemic changed everything. “I figured this pandemic was the correct time to shift focus to the online marketplace to sell my products keeping my core thoughts of a zero-exchange policy. There was an increase in demand and selling through messaging apps by sharing images was turning out to be tedious. An addition is our Resort Wear,” she said.
Rimi Nayak, also from Calcutta and designing for over a decade, never really felt the need to develop an e-commerce website before the pandemic hit and was happy selling through other modes. “The dreaded pandemic turned all that upside down. During the lockdown, the market scenario started shifting to digital, creating the urgent requirement to have our own e-commerce website,” said Rimi. She launched her website riminayakindia.com with FDCI’s Designer Showroom (a recent three-day online sale) end-July.
For Shilpa Sethi, founder and curator, Dapper Menswear, a fashion address in Calcutta that completed a year on August 3, an e-commerce portal was always in the pipeline. “When we ventured into the retail model, it was peak season time. Generally speaking, August till April is season time for retail/fashion industry and May-July is when everyone works on their new line of products for the fresh season again. From the onset, my strategy was to establish the store in the market using tried and tested traditional channels, and to gain some traction with low-hanging fruit over the peak season. Next on the agenda was the e-commerce portal, as an additional revenue channel in the off-season. Covid-19 hit us at a time when the off-season was about to set in. I took this as the perfect opportunity to work on the website, which is all virtual anyway,” she said. dappermenswear.in will be launching on August 27. Timelines were the hardest to meet. “Given the expedited launch date, we had to crunch our timelines and work collectively with our teams spread out in various places,” said Sanjay. Rimi was “a bit confused about whether to have the website designed as a standalone e-commerce site or a brand portfolio-cum-sales channel”. She finally decided to go with the latter. “So on our website, you can not only shop our products at amazing prices but also get a detailed overview of our brand’s history, signature design language along with notable achievements till date,” she says.
Shilpa found time management to be most challenging. “I was hoping to launch before Rakhi, but that didn’t work out due to many design/tech issues and many more features that I was keen to have on the website before its launch. Other challenges included scheduling product photo shoots and coordinating the availability with models, artists and photographers, despite careful planning and time-budgeting,” she said.  
For Rahul, the only challenge was to wait for the shoot. “We had to wait for the stores to open. Delhi models could not fly down as Noida-Delhi borders were blocked. We had to shoot with people in Delhi, local models and photographers. Social distancing was a challenge. That’s why it got pushed to first week of July before we could start the website,” said Rahul who would have ideally liked to launch it during the lockdown.   Raw Mango was focused on “giving our audiences the opportunity to explore our products whilst being immersed in a holistic experience, with a focus on ease and access to contactless deliveries”. Rimi spent quite a few sleepless nights at work. “Actually I took the Herculean task of designing the website myself. So apart from the coding, which was done by a friend of mine, I decided to do the entire design and layout of the website on my own,” she said.
Calcutta-based Eshaani Jayaswal too designed her own website, eshaani-jayaswal.com, and thoroughly enjoyed it. “The process began in November last year... from compiling images of the collections to conceptualising the feel and look of the website. When it comes to website designing you will want to consider the user experience. It should be easy to read and navigate for people of all ages. As I had started the process in November, it gave me enough time to research and see what works for our brand ethos and aesthetics. We have a huge database of images from the shoots that we do every year. I realised what an additional value the shoots added to the aesthetics of the website. I thoroughly enjoyed making the website to the minutest of details, from choosing the fonts to the theme. We launched it on May 13 and there has been no looking back since then,” smiled Eshaani whose brand turned 11 this year.
For Shilpa, it has been a learning curve. “We started the process in the month of June with an excellent team in place. Though it’s still within the retail industry, the requirements for the online venture are very different. We got in touch with budding menswear designers and have added many new designers on the e-commerce portal. The beauty of technology is that it is possible to scale exponentially, with very little additional strain on financial and tech resources,” she said.
The learnings have been many for Rahul too. “We have been in this business for long enough. In India, usually our saris and kurta-pyjamas are bestsellers. You need to customise the blouse and lehnga... we are learning every day... understanding product category. For luxury buying, you cannot take out human interaction even in e-commerce — that is also a learning. I might look at a language converter in future or people who can communicate in regional languages. I need to have different wholesale price and a different retail price,” he said. Rahul hasn’t put his ready-to-wear on the website “because there are already a lot of existing retailers in different geographical locations who might have a different kind of pricing”. The world is your oyster! “What digital has done is take a look at a product in the most authentic way… front and back detailed shots, the pricing… in a very honest way. And the person can be sitting anywhere. Now only the serious people are going to come forward, people who are comfortable with the workmanship and pricing,” said Rahul. It has also brought down the walls of the “limitations in terms of location and target audience” that plagues a brick-and-mortar store. “Calcutta is a fabulous market with substantial uncaptured demand within the menswear sector. Going online though changes the whole game and widens the scope of the brand on a national and global level. Being on the web is an opportunity to tap any market when the opportunity presents itself at low customer acquisition costs. Other big cities like Bombay, Delhi and the tier-two cities like Raipur, Surat offer substantial consumption potential. Being an exclusive Indian menswear designer portal, I am very positive about reaching out to the NRIs as well. The flexibility of an online portal also makes it very easy to adapt to the changing trends in consumer behaviour, given these uncertain times,” said Shilpa.
Rimi never thought her “product could have a market beyond the tier-one cities”. “I was pleasantly surprised to find out that a fair share of my online customers were from those locations,” she said. Rahul, Sanjay and Eshaani agreed that plagiarism was a big concern. “As a design house having an online presence allows people and brands in the space to take advantage of our work through plagiarism. I wish that this platform would be used more organically,” said Sanjay. The absence of touch and feel is a major disadvantage for Suman. “I love to feel the fabric before I buy something. So I still can never shop online for clothes myself but the times are for sure changing,” she said. Sanjay too felt the same. “I think that with textile and handloom, we do miss out on giving our customers that intimate experience of buying a product whilst being immersed holistically in a physical space, with all senses at play,” he said. Shilpa has tried her best to bridge this gap. “We have the WhatsApp feature to try and personalise the experience to a great extent with the help of our stylists,” she said. Omnichannel (denoting or relating to a type of retail which integrates the different methods of shopping available to consumers — like online, physical or by phone) is the unanimous choice. “With the launch of Raw Mango’s e-store www.rawmango.com, we have entered the omnichannel space. In addition to our studios in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, we are present in select multi-designer stores across India. The e-store adds another dimension to our retail presence,” said Sanjay. Rimi will stock a special range of products that will be exclusively available on her website.
Dapper Menswear has added 20 new labels and is launching the portal with 40-plus established and new designers. “The bulk of the ad budget will now be allocated to social media platforms to reach and acquire new customers. We are exclusively looking at broadening the variety of products available at the store and have added new names that specialise in fun accessories, quirky shirts, athleisure products, loungewear and many others who fit into the sub-sector of ‘Indianwear with a twist’,” said Shilpa. “Easy shopping and faster checkouts” are the mantras. “To ensure personal engagement with the buyers, we have set up the tool to chat with our in-house executives for a second opinion as well as for made-to-measure products. The technology allows us to track user’s browsing behaviour and accordingly suggest items based on their tastes, which will make it a very personal experience for the buyer,” added Shilpa.
Rahul, however, felt that the importance of human interaction cannot be undermined. “We have got multiple team members answering everyone’s queries. The physical world is like a foundation and the digital world is like expanding your reach. People need to realise that the best combination is digital experience and human experience. The setting up of a physical universe becomes important when you grow virtually. Once your clients become familiar, it becomes far more easier,” said Rahul, who wants to have a flagship store in every geographical cluster… Dubai, Paris, London.

Two characters from different dimensions stuck in the same house...," After winning accolades for their film Ghost of the Golden Groves, Aniket Dutta and Roshni Sen are back with a new project — a music video for the song Wholeness and the Implicate Order by the London experimental group The Lost Dinosaur. While Aniket has directed it, Roshni has produced the black-and-white project, which is on YouTube now. “Space is an important theme for all our projects, be it outer space or the constrained individual space forced out of the Covid aftermath. Coming out of a prolonged lockdown where everything seemed unreal, working on this video was like a lucid dream experience,” says Roshni.
Aniket gives The Telegraph a lowdown on the genesis of the video and more...

What was the starting point for this video for Wholeness and the Implicate Order by The Last Dinosaur?
Well, Jamie (from The Last Dinosaur) and I were talking about doing something together for a long time, which didn’t work out back then as we were busy with Ghost... through 2018-19. And when he finally finished this song, the pandemic was here.

Did you get a brief from The Last Dinosaur?
Jamie really likes the otherworldliness of our film-making, which he wanted to connect to his track.

What were your thoughts when you heard the piece of music for the first time?
This is not exactly the kind of music I’ve worked with before but the grandeur of it (especially the mix) really grew on me.

How did you visualise it? What did you want to communicate through the video?

The track shares its name with a book by quantum physicist David Bohm and the first thing that came to mind was to add a multi-dimensional layer to the video. So I borrowed a character from my debut feature who lives in a different dimension. Also, going through the Covid pandemic gave us a good opportunity to self-reflect. It’s a scenario where one sometimes has a physical sensation of dreaming it all... I’ve tried to capture this mind-body dualism through the video.

After Ghost of the Golden Groves, you go back to black-and-white here. Why?
They watched our film (Ghost...) last year at Leicester Square and wanted to make a black-and-white project with us primarily. We actually wanted to do something in colour.

How was it written?
I had created a moodboard and a short treatment with the characters to begin with. Later we brought in more cosmic and ominous layers to it with some amount of improvisations that we achieved on set and in the post production.

We see a house of memories. Tell us about the storyline?
It’s a narrative of two characters from different dimensions who are stuck in the same house, waiting for some sort of a galactic alignment to summon each other.

Scenes dissolve into one another; there’s a fan with two blades. Tell us about the visual themes and cues?
The main idea was to explore the intersections of the two characters from two different dimensions and also to bring out the memories that are stuck in the house through generations. I was interested in transmitting this collating of dreams, planets, jellyfish and memories, which for me manifests aesthetically and structurally.

How was it like shooting during a pandemic? Where did you shoot?
We shot in a building located in one of the old neighbourhoods of south Calcutta. It was a strange yet interesting experience... of course there were constraints with limited crew, sanitisations etc but this is probably the future. We shot in July on one of the no-lockdown days.

Tell us about casting Rupsha Guha?
She has a very versatile look that is quite timeless, which I think was a good fit and also she managed to retain a deadpan expression throughout, which along with the masked character, and all the other elements blended into the space we intended to create.",culture
A special shoot," A little bit of sky
In these months of lockdown we have all learnt what it means to live in a staged reality. With the outside inaccessible, our worlds suddenly shrank down to the bare essentials. All the things we have always taken for granted were suddenly not so important or entirely inaccessible. Faced with the prospect of being ‘caged-in’, many of us constructed our own realities within our own homes, to help retain some sort of order and normalcy.

Collection type: Resort, pret

Inspiration: This campaign draws inspiration from such staged flights of fancy during lockdown. Fluid drapes and structured silhouettes combined with the graphic prints speaks of an attempt to escape from immediate realities. But escape is not possible and hence we remain rooted to the confines of our interiors. The images shot were digitally incorporated within larger-than-life graphic backgrounds from our everyday surroundings. As if it’s all been shot around our homes or the garden or on rooftops of buildings using 3D realism and form.

Premise and design
It took the collaborative efforts of our team of craftsmen, staff and designers to come up with a line that is rooted in two sensibilities. A tribal past rooted in an ethical approach to the environment in conversation with the future we are all inevitably marching towards. Inspirations came directly from the Warli art form of the Adivasi tribes of North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra, which have been incorporated in our more contemporary textures, drapes and silhouettes. The clamp-dye print, often left incomplete with a structured silhouette, is design stripped down to its bare and minimum in keeping with the mood of the hour.

The players
It was also a collaborative effort from our models and performers. Dancer Mekhola (Bose) was instrumental in giving these garments the free-spirited look that we had intended. A sense of freedom, fluid and unrestrained, that speaks of innate power at its heart. (Mohammed) Iqbal is always ready to experiment with whatever potentially awkward scenario we throw at him and always comes out tops. Our in-house assistant designer Aavya (Nath) perfectly brought out the ‘drag’ vibe we wanted for her pieces — carefully controlled chaos ready to detonate, but always with humour.
We worked with artist and architect Aniket Rathore to create backdrops of 3D realism that were both commonplace and yet larger than life. All the images are designed keeping in mind that we wanted to have a certain amount of playfulness in each of them, while capturing the essence of each of these outfits which were designed during the lockdown period. It’s graphic and architectural in its appearance while the popping foliage at times is softening down the imagery.
Make-up artist Abhijit Chanda was given a free hand to highlight a look of whimsy in the trio to complement the interplay of structured and fluid forms and the prints.",culture
Hector Garcia on Seeking Ikigai," Back in 2017, a small 170-page book was released with a powder blue cover that had these beautiful cherry blossoms painted on it. I distinctly remember not thinking much about it till articles about the book’s swift ascension on global bestseller lists and its rave reviews from trusted sources piqued my interest. Soon, I found myself feverishly looking up words such as ichariba chode (treating everyone as brothers even those you have not met before), moai (informal social groups who look out for each other) and uimaaru (teamwork). Turned out, Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life, was not your run-of-the-mill self-help book but was steeped in research and facts, based on co-authors Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles’s stories about Japan’s Okinawa community that is touted to have the most number of centenarians in the world. And with all of us in the need and pursuit of ikigai more than ever right now, the Prabha Khaitan Foundation organised a tete-a-tete with Garcia on August 5 that had author Vikram Sampath peeking into the mind of the Ikigai author as they discussed writing the book and navigating the present crisis.
“Ikigai is a mysterious Japanese word which roughly translates to ‘the happiness of always being busy’ or simply put, the principle of finding and living one’s passion,” Garcia said. A former software engineer, Garcia recounted his own story of finding ikigai after he suffered through a bout of prolonged illness. “I have always been very curious. Writing the book proved therapeutic for me and I found my own ikigai over the years. It is important to be surrounded by the right people,” he said. The book that has been translated into over 50 languages explores a multitude of topics including the importance of rest, spiritual thinking and the spirit of community for a long and peaceful life.
The author also emphasised on the importance of simplicity as he said, “The little things of life are like reminders of what we should do. Not being stressed is the underlying common factor. There are so many ways of fighting stress like mindfulness, meditation and others but you just have to smile. Don’t think about retiring, don’t think about work all the time, but be active. Do yoga.”
During these difficult times, even the best of us are grateful for the simple things in life and even Garcia admitted that he read his own book recently during this period. “Hardships and sufferings in life, though not desired, make the human spirit more resilient and help us,” said the author, in a poignant reflection of the difficult times that have both divided and united all of us.",culture
Wattpad on disrupting entertainment one fiction piece at a time," The leading global, storytelling community-building platform Wattpad proved to be a safe haven for many during the lockdown period. Democratising the publishing industry, Wattpad operates in all the countries in the world except China and aims to empower writers around the world to connect directly with their readers and often reach a much larger reader base than the traditional paper-and-ink route. The model is simple — readers and writers meet on the platform to create and consume fictional content that could be a short story, a novella or an entire book. Wattpad then aims to be the liaison between the writers and the right connections to give your content the platform it deserves.
The Kissing Booth, a YA film on Netflix, was a story written on Wattpad by a then-15-year-old Beth Reekles and managed to take the world by storm putting the actress Joey King firmly on the map, even warranting a sequel. With global partners like HarperCollins Publishers, Hachette Book Group, NBC and Simon and Schuster, Wattpad forms a symbiotic relationship for all stakeholders.
Wattpad India set up shop in 2018 in Bombay, with Devashish Sharma taking on the role of country head. For Independence Day this year, Wattpad tied up with Applause Entertainment Partners to promote Avrodh, by asking users to pen a poem, story or snippet on the topic ‘My Patriotism’ or ‘Meri Deshbhakti’. Around 1,500 entries and 44,000 minutes of reading the content, writers’ thoughts were even made into exciting social media creatives to promote on all social media channels. Partnerships work well for brands also because the conversations that happen on the content itself. “For OTT platforms, they have a selection of stories to choose (about 600 million) from and also has a clearly emerging data set of points from the conversations that allows them to understand what scene that character resonates the most and why,” said Sharma.
While promotional activities of this kind prove to be beneficial for brands, due to the direct connect formed with millennials and Gen Z in the country, it is the visibility and exposure given to writers that makes Wattpad tick. “The gratification is instantaneous as opposed to a physical copy of a book that would take at least a year to reach your audience, with multiple levels of editing, cover design and printing,” said Sharma. This instantaneous reaction works not just in the form of gratification but also research and feedback that is immensely important for a writer. What resonates with a reader and what works and doesn’t work for them, gets discussed in the comments, giving the writer a much detailed path to focus on. Neil D’Silva, a reputed author of the horror genre, who has previously been published by Penguin and Hachette India, chose to use this lockdown to launch his next on this digital platform and on Day 1, the book had 10,000 reach.
A global fan base is another point of celebration for writers on Wattpad as your next fan could well be sitting in the Philippines, devouring the next page your write. For readers and lovers of fiction, the platform forms an escape with users spending an average of 37 minutes daily on the website consuming content. “Wattpad is a sort of portal for readers to escape the day-to-day negative stuff and connect with similar-minded people who are reading what you are. We saw a growth of almost 50 per cent in all major metrics during this lockdown,” added Sharma. For established writers with a large follower base, Wattpad eventually puts some of the content behind a paywall, enabling monetary gains for them. Wattpad’s Story DNA Machine Learning technology helps the platform to understand which stories are doing well and give it the necessary push. It’s no surprise that the app or the website witnesses close to 80 million monthly users.
“Exploring topics that are slightly under-represented in traditional publishing like queer themes, body positivity and mental health find a voice on this platform,” cited Sharma as one of the reasons why users stick around on this platform for as long as they do. User retention is the strong suit for Wattpad and we can sense why. Another such reason would be the language used by the majority, which is Hinglish or more local, which proves to be easier and more comfortable for a new reader.
Sharma tells us about a 20-year-old from Imphal who started writing when she was in the 12th standard and now has over 20 million followers. “She has followers in the USA and more and this kind of reach would have been impossible had she chosen to take the traditional route of publishing,” Sharma reminded us, with her being one of the authors with some of her content behind a paywall. 
Wattpad Books in the USA publishes books directly, in some countries, tie-ups with publishers do. They don’t know the route they would take in India but plans in the pipeline are aplenty. “Disrupting entertainment” as well as “disrupting the evolution of story discovery till the point it finds an audience” — that’s how Sharma would like to sum up the space that Wattpad occupies amongst millennials.",culture
Make-up pro Ruby Hammer looks back at her successful journey," Ruby Hammer has a radiant charm about her. A beautiful smile, kind twinkling eyes and oh-so-comfortable in her own skin. The London-based ‘global make-up artist’ who has three decades of experience in her kitty and many a coveted assignment, has an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire). Her Instagram posts are heartfelt with a soul connect. And, even though she cannot read or write Bengali, we claim her as one of our own. Yes, Ruby was born to Bangladeshi parents and loves her dal-bhaat. We wrote to Ruby requesting for a chat and the ever-polite stunner answered our questions over email.

A big hello from Calcutta. Have you ever been to Calcutta?  
Hello back ... no never, but I definitely want to.

You were born to Bangladeshi parents. Do you speak Bengali? If yes, then what is your favourite Bengali word and why?
Yes I speak Bengali but cannot read or write it as I was born in Nigeria, then moved to the UK when I was 12. I went home on holidays but never lived there. My favourite Bengali word is ‘khuttar bacha shoor’ .…(Sorry!)

Are you big on Bengali food?
I love dal bhaat, sabji, chicken.… I am not the biggest fish lover, shame as a Bengali.

What was your childhood like? Was it full of Bangaliana?
My childhood was in Africa. So not at all. We had to speak English in school. I speak the Nigerian dialect Hausa and spoke Bengali at home with my family, my parents and two younger brothers.

At what point did you know that make-up was your calling and what about it appealed to you the most? Were your parents supportive of your decision, given that the profession wasn’t really considered a profession when you started?

After I finished my economics degree, I got an opportunity to assist a professional make-up artist during London Fashion Week in 1984.
My parents were very supportive as they saw how passionate I have always been about make-up and beauty and I completed my educational studies up to degree level. I have a BA in economics from City, University of London, so there was no real argument as I had completed my studies and was pursuing my passion. If it didn’t work out I could change direction later.

Are you self-taught?
Yes… I assisted for two years... no formal training.

Did you have a plan in place? How did you go about setting up your career?  
No plans at all… just ready to grab any opportunities that came my way. I tested a lot with photographers for no money to learn and kept pushing myself to be better.

What were the initial hiccups?
Just navigating my way around an unknown to me industry and facing competition.

One of your recent Instagram posts talks about racial discrimination. How did you respond to them at a much gentle age?
With reason and logic and sometimes with anger. You do have to stand up for yourself without putting yourself in danger.

Who were your icons?
Iman, Bianca Jagger, Janice Dickinson, Grace Jones, Malala (Yousafzai).

Who are your all-time favourite stars you have worked with?
Tom Hanks... Helen Mirren... Rita Wilson... lots of world-famous top models like Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell... Sonam Kapoor for an Indian magazine… in a 30-year career too many to pick... lots of memories.

Make-up has seen a complete shift in the last two decades. What are the high and low points according to you?
The highs are vegan make-up, cruelty-free make-up, making packaging and other aspects sustainable or recyclable... more information on how to do any kind of make-up on social media.... The lows are there is still no equal opportunities. There are still gaps in inclusivity or diversity not just by race...by sex…by size, age…. We still don’t see a broad and wide reflection of the world as it is. We still only see youth or one kind of beauty. The recent issues with Black Lives Matter simply highlight how far we still need to go.

And, what will never change? What would you say is the essence of make-up?
We as a human race will always be attracted to beauty and youth as a sign of health and being fit and strong. So our interest in making the most of ourselves will never end. Make-up is essentially a tool to help with this … to enhance what we have or to hide or downplay when we are in need of help to present a better facade.

How do you want women to look at make-up or treat make-up?
I think of make-up as a tool to help you with your confidence, creativity and to enhance your features… not just to downplay your perceived negative attributes. People use too much make-up… don’t blend enough. Learn what suits you and your features. Don’t just follow a trend without thinking if it suits you.

We love how positive your Instagram posts are. Happy, calm and ‘Unapologetically’ you. As someone who has been a part of the beauty industry for so long, how do you view this fixation on looks? What do you tell all the women and girls you meet?
A healthy interest is a sign of self-care, but to be obsessed with fighting the ageing process or seeking so-called perfection and focusing only on your negative features and not seeing everyone has something unique in their looks is not what I advocate. I say have a routine in place. Maintain it and enjoy life and your unique looks... this is healthy.

In the wake of the pandemic, how will our relationship with make-up change?
It will be all about hygiene, which will take out the fun of interacting and experimenting, but if it keeps us safe.… No sharing and more sampling as we can’t test everything like before.

What happens to the lipsticks? How do you want women to approach their lipsticks now?
Lipstick will still hold its place. Just not while we wear masks but as soon as it’s safe to take them off... your lips come into view so you must make an effort.

How has your relationship with make-up evolved over the years?
It is simply an ongoing one that deepens and still gets me excited and full of passion... simply love what I do and feel blessed to make a living from my passion and grateful to be considered as successful too in this chosen field.

What is the biggest lesson that the beauty business has taught you?  
How united we are and supportive like with the BLM campaign.... Clapping and boosting the NHS in the UK, we all took part to give our carers, doctors and nurses our time to show our appreciation. There were beauty banks to donate products .

What has been your success mantra?
Doing good, feels good!",culture
Jokes go on forever," Sample this meme: “Be nice to your wife. Restaurants are closed.” Laughter emoticon laughter emoticon laughter emoticon. Another one comes with a picture of Tom Hanks and a tagline: “When you get coronavirus with your wife. And it was your only chance to get away from her.” What did Rita Wilson, Hanks’ actress wife, do? Does Hanks even know he said this? Then there is one that insinuates that the wife and the maid have now switched roles. It depicts the wife slim and sexy, after all the household chores, while the maid is fat and lazy. 
The pandemic has made another thing go viral: sexist jokes. Not that there was ever a let-up, but these tough times make putting up with obnoxiousness that much more difficult. Maybe some people with no housework to do can devote themselves entirely to making bad jokes.
Or is it because couples are spending too much time together and it is too much for the men? Because we still don’t have as many sexist jokes about men, do we?
“I am tired of memes depicting homemakers as quarrelsome, jealous or foolish and husbands as smug or tortured. It’s unfair to both,” says an executive.
Even the first family of the entertainment world has not been spared. A meme revives a scene from Silsila with actresses Rekha and Jaya Bachchan. Its tagline says: “Tiffin kaun lekey jaiga” (who will bring the food ) – an obvious reference to Big B’s hospitalisation with the virus.

This, despite men “liking” women. “We like women, not content that demeans them,” says a friend. Soon after he forwards me a video that he had saved lovingly in his phone gallery. It shows a masked woman shopping in a super-market in a foreign land, her tank top offering a peekaboo. The video comes with an advice: “Women need more masks than one.” We need a good vaccine for sexism.",culture
A dose of trap and bass with Mr Doss," With the quarantine keeping everyone in their zone, Mr Doss (Rishiraj Doss) has released a new track called Zone mein on August 11. Featuring city-based rapper J Trix, the trap and bass producer has curated the music in a subtle manner, keeping the focus on the lyrics. Aside from this release, Mr Doss, originally from Calcutta (now based in Bangalore), is also scheduled to release some fresh music in the near future. A chat with the artiste.

Does the track’s title have anything to do with the quarantine?
It did not have anything to do with the quarantine because we started conceptualising it before all this started. The essence of the track was to tell people to mind their business and focus on their work and better their art rather than giving two hoots about who is saying what about them. That is the only way one can progress and succeed in life. But since we moved into quarantine, through the tracks we have added lyrics which have become relevant to the present scenario.

How did the collab with J Trix happen?
J Trix and I did a show at Topcat CCU (Topsia) towards the end of last year. He was the rapper and I was the artiste closing the night and we connected. When we met later, we really vibed with each other and liked each other’s music and I was just getting to know the Calcutta hip-hop scene. We just started chilling and sharing ideas and music and we loved what we were doing.

What do you like about his flow?
I love his writing. He writes a lot of punchlines which can be used as captions and are super relevant at the same time. His flow is amazing; he has all the boxes checked when it comes to rapping.

What else to expect from Mr Doss?
I have two tracks that I produced for IncInk Records which are doing great right now and I’m getting great feedback. I have a bunch of tracks coming out with Mumbai rappers, which I can’t disclose right now and there’s some independent content that I’m coming out with... trap and bass stuff with some hip-hop.

What about the two tracks that released under IncInk, Ranveer Singh’s label?

IncInk and I have had a close relationship. I had done a gig with one of their artistes in Bangalore in 2019. So we chilled and they liked my set and they got in touch with me and we have been working back and forth with things. We have some projects in the future but it hasn’t been finalised yet, so I can’t say anything about that. About the last two tracks, I had sent them a bunch of beats and they chose the ones they liked the most. They then got their rapper SlowCheetah on board who was also part of Gully Boy. Two of my beats were chosen to be a part of his EP Rok Nahi Payega.

Do you think people are listening to music more than ever before? Most people are at home.
People are definitely listening to more music right now. I know so many people are just working and listening to music in the background, so there are a lot more people listening to music and a lot more people releasing music online. People are now more focused on good music rather than only searching for artistes they know. It can be their friends or something that someone finds online randomly but people are definitely looking for quality music and they’re getting into new stuff.

You’ve come back to the city from Bangalore after six years. What is your take on the music scene in Calcutta?
People want to try out new stuff. I come from electronic with trap and bass background... at times I dabble with hip-hop and use vocals. Earlier people weren’t aware of such a sound. Now they like it. They are okay with experimenting with new stuff in clubs. And one thing about the rap scene all over India is that people used to think that rapping should mostly be done in English because they first heard rap coming from the West but now everyone is super comfortable and confident rapping in their native language. Now it’s about how good your poetry is.",culture
A sneak peek of two home-grown brands...," A board strewn with clothes and embellished with foliage. The logo of Fanush by Roja — model Roja Paromita Dey’s label — is charmingly warm and happy. That’s the idea says Roja. She wants her creations to spread joy. A chat with The Telegraph.

It’s been a year since we shot for the t2 story which featured your designs first, sort of your debut as a designer. You had said it will lead to bigger things and it has...
Yeah! (Laughs) It’s been a year that I had been dreaming. Then my wedding came in between. That was another massive project, also a solo one, which took two months of my life. Designing my own wedding is coming handy now. I had to make clothes for so many people... my sister, my sisters-in-law... half of my family was wearing things which I had made.
Once I came back from my honeymoon, I was very relaxed and Maldives does that to you. It rejuvenates you. My mind was completely uncluttered and I wanted to get busy with Fanush. I didn’t want to get into a shongshar er rhythm. Of course you balance, but I didn’t want to get very comfortable in that space. The lockdown started when I was a week into that project.

The lockdown probably helped you focus better...
It gave me a lot of time to plan it better. Setting up of my workshop was easier because of the ample time I had. I had also booked my tailor and I started work in the pandemic to give him work.

The name is beautiful...
When I finally thought about starting, I went ahead and bought my material and started designing. Suddenly it occurred to me that I don’t even have a name. It is a massive job thinking about a name and is almost like naming your child. You don’t want to go wrong with it. It’s the first thing about your brand that people will notice. I was looking for something unique and Fanush just came to me while I was scrolling Facebook. It was just perfect because I was looking for a happy name. It should bring a smile to your face. That’s exactly how I want my clothes to be. Whoever is buying it should feel like he or she is purchasing a piece of joy. It has a magical element to it...
Absolutely! I had this cover photo of Tangled where Rapunzel and Flynn are in a boat at a lantern festival and there are thousands of lanterns around them. When I was watching the movie, that scene felt so magical and took me to another world. I was sure about the name and whoever has heard it has complimented the name.

And, you are one-woman army...
In the lockdown, absolutely that. I am the designer, the procurer, the jhharu-pochhawala, tea man....

How is it being an entrepreneur?
I don’t think I have been this happy in the last 10 years. The modelling career was beautiful. I love it and is one of the best decisions of my life. I have learnt so much. There is, however, a constant doubt about this profession. You know it won’t last long and you are dependent on other people to give you work. The uncertainty is massive and these years are precious in everyone’s life. At this stage of my life, I wanted something more stable and reliable. I am not cut out for a 9-5 job. Being my own boss has been the best thing. I have been looking for this forever and I am loving it. Fanush is totally mine. Otar mojatai alada. You can literally work till you drop, but you wouldn’t complain and you are happy when you go to bed.

All the designs are simple and straight, much like your own style…
It is about my aesthetics and also heavily inspired from the designers I have worked with. Most of the fabrics are from the sustainable family… cotton. I don’t believe in fast fashion and I no longer indulge in it. We want to make clothes which will have quality, style, values and it will last longer. I have always styled my clothes in so many different ways that even if I have repeated my clothes, people wouldn’t be able to tell. Who did you sell the first piece to and what was that feeling like?
Dodo (husband, Indraneel Roy, who along with sister Kathakali Roy are Roja’s business partners), came on the first day and picked up four shirts after a quick trial. Otate oi anondo ta nei but the day I got my first order from an outsider on Facebook... I got the dress ready within a day and delivered to her in three days. She sent me a long, heartfelt message praising everything, from the design to the packaging. That was moving. That a complete stranger trusted me and I delivered beyond her expectations, felt so good.

You would like to dress…
Sabyasachi Mukherjee! I would select a kurta pyjama, in the rarest and finest muslin in white and do ivory resham floral embroidery on it myself. It is my dream. I am waiting for the day when Nayanika (Chatterjee) ma’am would wear my clothes. Aparna Sen too... she is so graceful.

Price range: Rs 1,500-Rs 15,000 Buy less. Wear more’ is the mantra behind Chitrangada Satarupa’s year-old Candy’d Closet that took off last September. The petite actress who wears many hats, tells The Telegraph what has changed in her as far as fashion goes.

How was Candy’d Closet born?
I am obsessed with clothes from childhood and like different kind of designs, colours, styles and am not brand conscious at all. I like building a collection even though it might just be lying in my closet. Sometimes you might see a design in a film or a magazine which you might not get easily or they might be expensive. So, I started making my own clothes. My mother (film-maker Satarupa Sanyal) would sew us clothes as kids. I thought of starting a brand because I like creating and making an affordable range.
Around the same time I started this brand, I started becoming more aware of sustainability and got to know about the dark story behind fast fashion... cheap labour, the work conditions, a huge amount of water wastage. And, I would just add to it. Getting weavers to weave a sustainable line might be too big a plan for me, but I wanted to create something. Then it occurred to me how about if I upcycle saris and available material.
I shared this with my mother and she immediately gave me a pile of 15-20. With that I launched my first collection which had blouses and crop tops. There were a couple of tops, overlays, dresses. All the pieces are limited edition. I have pushed myself to try silhouettes that I haven’t worn, just to see how it looks.

What all have you worked on so far?
I did a capsule collection in January which was named after three strong protagonists of Tagore... Mrinmoyee, Labonnya, Charu. I also tied up with a pandemic relief fund who were working in the slums of Madh Island. This is my baby step for this big movement that the whole world is coming together for.

Is the present collection wholly fashioned from your mom’s wardrobe?
The orange-pink sari was gifted to me by my friend. She said the colour was too bright for her. So, my friends have been sweet and kind. I plan to launch it right before Pujas. What kind of saris do you like?
I am a big fan of cotton saris in general… the Phulia sari. I also love Dhakai and have a huge fascination for white Dhakais. My mother has passed on her love for white saris to me.

Do you want to diversify with Candy’d Closet?
My plan was to involve artisans from Santiniketan, but with the pandemic, plans have gone awry. My mother has been making dolls out of socks and waste products. They are amazing and there is a lot of demand on her Facebook profile. I have told her she has to do the business deal with me because it goes with my profile. I’ll include some of her dolls in my collection in a month or two.  

How does it feel being your own boss?
There is no pressure because I am my own boss. I don’t know how great a business person I am yet, but there is no burden to break even. This is my baby, my passion project. So, I want to do it my way. I want this plant to grow at her own speed, just like slow fashion. Your brand is all about upcycling and regeneration. Can you name three personalities who are all about upcycling as far as their profession goes?
Kalki (Koechlin) has redefined the idea of being a popular as well as artistic performer by choosing different kind of roles. She has been loyal to her love for theatre and added more value to the platform. Upcycled means giving more creative value to the already existing resources. Vidya Balan is another personality who has been an inspiration by kicking all the stereotypes and being a flagbearer of the concept ‘create your own genre’. She regenerated herself with her talent, charisma and shone like the brightest star. I’m a big Greta Gerwig fan. I have loved her since the time she was an actor. I had a strong feeling that she will be an interesting film-maker in the future. Well I wasn’t wrong and I cannot help but love her for regenerating herself as an artist and storyteller. I know you said three but I will have to take Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s name. Her work speaks of the regenerating and fantastic personality she is.

A peek into the bookshelves of a few authors," Reading means different things to different people. While for some it begins as an escape turning into an escapade with every turn of the page, for others it is a lust for the unknown, resulting in imbibing every ounce of new knowledge. While authors are mostly asked about their writing, The Telegraph asked seven authors about their reading habits. While sharing, the authors also gave us a glimpse of their bookshelves — an important aspect of every book lover’s DNA!  Nandana Dev Sen, who has authored six children’s books, defines herself as a “gluttonous, indiscriminate, compulsive and incurable” reader. Giving us a peek into her bookshelves, she says, “Books have always invaded, multiplied in, and taken over any place I’ve lived in. My shelves are messy, spilling over with books stacked in every direction. Each of my three homes (in three continents) is overrun with books, but the bookshelves in “Bhalobasha” (her mother Nabaneeta Dev Sen’s house) have always stood out for their sheer versatility. On any given shelf, you could find Bangla classics, Victorian novels, Sanskrit scriptures, bilingual European poetry. All huddled next to each other. I definitely inherited my obsession with books from Ma.” Dharini Bhaskar, who debuted with the novel These, Our Bodies, Possessed By Light, says, “My earliest memories revolve around the bookshelves, stretching floor to ceiling, in my parents’ home.” After setting up a home, the first furniture she bought was a bookshelf. She says, “Everything else arranged itself around my first acquisition. This bookshelf is shaped like a honeycomb — a design that communicates my faith in the interconnectedness of stories. It houses my beloved books — those with notes scribbled along the margins, and with dried petals. The bookshelves kept multiplying. A long and towering one that holds works of poetry, collected during my travels. An inherited, rose wood and regal one that holds an assortment of loves — from travel to child psychology. An all yellow one, carrying the stuff of my toddler’s dreams — Bernard Duisit, Kaori Takahashi, and tales published by Enchanted Lion. The bookshelves I own are my anchors, steadying me when life feels overwhelming. They are also magic carpets, whisking me off to new worlds.” Lavanya Lakshminarayan, who launched her first book Analog/ Virtual: And Other Simulations of Your Future in 2020, says, “My childhood home spilled over with books of every kind. I’ve travelled with them, moved houses with them, and lost myself within their pages. The soul of my apartment is a bookshelf dedicated to my biggest influences — Ursula K Le Guin, Ted Chiang, Jeff VanderMeer and Alan Moore and others. A few treasured books also reside here, including the collected works of Lewis Carroll, Beatrix Potter and A.A. Milne. My shelves are sorted by genre, arranged alphabetically by author, and peppered with collectibles. However, my Kindle library has become irreplaceable, especially through the pandemic. While I love the feel of a paperback or hardcover, I can’t imagine my life without instant access to my entire library.” Deepa Agarwal, who has written many books belonging to the genre of children’s literature such as Caravan To Tibet and Journey to the Forbidden City, shares, “As a reader, I pick books according to my current mood. I also need research material for my writing, so my shelves stock a wide variety, from thrillers to historical fiction, children’s books in different genres to classics, information books on topics like culture, history or nature. My bookshelves are arranged specifically so I can locate a particular book without wasting time. Thus, I have separate shelves for poetry, short story collections, classics, traditional tales, non-fiction… and, of course, my own writing.” Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi, who penned books titled The Last Song of Dusk, The Lost Flamingoes of Bombay and The Rabbit and The Squirrel, says, “I’m a boring reader, which is to say I read the same books repeatedly. I’d have read The English Patient 50 times now; Beloved, at least 12. At my writing studio in Mumbai my library has Philip Roth, W.G Sebald, most of Capote, including various biographies. I am not a promiscuous reader. My ring of books is small. But I revisit each one often. You read more deeply the second time around. After the 10th, it’s a love story. A book I recently read was Asymmetry by Lisa Halliday, essential reading, a master class in fiction, and in tenderness.” Sandip Roy, author of the 2015 title Don’t Let Him Know, says, “My family got me bookshelves for my birthday because they were tired of my book piles all over the house after I overflowed the existing bookshelves. And for a minute I organised them neatly. However, as books multiplied like rabbits, I ended up with book piles on the bookshelves as well. When I see people pose in front of immaculately organised bookshelves, now that so many literary events happen on Zoom, I feel quite embarrassed about my book towers. But sometimes a book pile can actually look quite cool like the year we had a book pile Christmas tree. But don’t ask me how long it took to disassemble and return the books to the shelves!” Paro Anand, who has many children’s and young adult’s books to her credit like I’m Not Butter Chicken, The Tree with a Travelling Heart and Like Smoke: 20 Teens 20 Stories considers herself to be a “random reader”. She further explains, “So, my bookshelf is pretty random as well. I will pull any book off the shelf and dive right in. But I also give myself the freedom to discard a book if I don’t feel like sticking with it. I keep thinking I should curate my bookshelf, organise it by alphabetical order, genre, or anything. I have been thinking about doing that for maybe 20 odd years. I may get to it in another 40, when I am 100 years old. But I finally do have a wonderful little Roald Dahl-esq little cottage at the bottom of my garden where I disappear to read and write.”",culture
Mira Rajput Kapoor on motherhood," She stepped into the spotlight the day she tied the knot with Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor. Having become a mother at a young age of 22, Mira Rajput Kapoor with her girl-next-door sensibilities, paints a picture of a cool, young-age, millennial mother… someone who seems to take interest in the Ayurvedic way of life. Mira was part of a Zoom session, organised by Tata Sampann, where she spoke about how she spices up her health, before telling us about life in lockdown and her favourite all-in-one ingredient — turmeric.

What is “me time” like for you, especially keeping the current scenario in mind?
I really started doing and enjoying yoga and it is something that I have discovered I am very good at. It’s a skill that I want to learn. I have also taken some Ayurvedic courses and I am very passionate about it.
I have also realised that there are a lot more things that I want to learn because once you are done with regular duties and responsibilities for the day, you realise what you missed out on. The lockdown has given me some time to take on courses, read books that I have missed out on.

Are there any changes that you have adopted in your lifestyle?
I have always been interested in health, wellness, and now recently with the whole Ayurvedic way of cooking. It is not just about the cuisine but it’s more about what is the produce that is being used to cook our food — whether it’s organic, is it in season, is it sustainably farmed. My choices regarding food have become more mindful now.

What is your favourite Indian spice?  
We actually associate spices with taste but don’t realise the number of medicinal benefits spices have. My favourite is haldi (turmeric) because it has so many benefits and there are so many different ways you can use it. You can use it in your tadka (tempering), you can add it to your kadha (Ayurvedic decoction) you can add it in your milk and even apply it on your skin. The second most important thing for me is the seasoning, salt and nothing is more essential than adding salt to your food. Also, I prefer salty food over sweet.

Is there any tip and trick that you learnt from your mother that has come in handy since you became a mother?
When I used to have a cold, especially during the monsoons when we used to run out and come back completely drenched and wake up the next morning with a runny nose and sore throat, I remember my mom used to prepare this kadha which she picked up from my naani and it used to have haldi, black pepper, some crushed ginger, tulsi (holy basil) and kalaunji (Nigella seeds) all mixed up, and I remember I hated it. But it was so effective and now I think life has definitely come a full circle because I give the same to my kids.

Are you a strict mother who makes sure her children are having their greens?  
Our Indian food has always been wholesome. It consists of grains, spices, seasonings, vegetables, dairy products for protein, and some pickle or chutney which makes our food automatically balanced and one does not need to pay a lot of attention to ensure that the food is nutritious and tasty. I also give my kids things like amla (Indian gooseberry) juice and haldi doodh (turmeric milk) regularly and we started all this when they were really young....

You are married to one of the fittest actors in Bollywood. What does being fit mean to you?
For me, fitness is important in all aspects — mind, body and soul. It is a combination of working out, going for a walk, playing with kids, meditation and yoga. All of these things I think make you physically and mentally fit and sound.

You seem like someone who is really comfortable in her skin. What are your tips for young mothers?  
Do everything that you can along with your partner. Nothing is better than doing things together. Ups and downs in life will always happen but getting through them with your partner by your side makes the experience even more joyful.
Include some sort of physical exercise that is doable after the 40 days are up, whether its yoga, Pilates, or anything you are comfortable doing. Make that a daily one-hour of your me time. Include all of these age-old remedies that we have like saunf-ajwain ka paani (fennel-carom seeds water). I had a lot of methi (fenugreek) in my food, I had a lot of jeera (cumin) in my food, and vegetables like ghia (bottle gourd), torrai (ridge gourd), rice and jaggery. These things really helped me and you know you really don’t need to know a lot. My advice for all mothers would be to inculcate natural remedies that you may have and those that our mothers have taught us and start early because when they (children) grow up and get into school and start seeing their friends making faces, it gets more difficult.

You embraced motherhood at a young age. What are some of the things you learnt that you want to share with women who want to have children when they are young?
Listen to yourself. If you are feeling hungry, eat. If you are feeling sleepy, sleep. You don’t have to go on the Internet that tells you how many hours to sleep and when to eat. Go with your body and follow what your body tells you.",culture
Elvis Presley left the building 43 years ago...," Early this month, a music milestone was made — Drake broke the record for the most top 10 hits in the history of the Billboard Hot 100. At the same time, a legend has slipped down the ladder to number 10 on the same list — Elvis Presley, who passed away on August 16, 1977. While Drake — who is 33 years old — has 40 hits, Elvis could manage 25 by the time he passed away at the age of 42. The rock-and-roll legend is now kept company by Lil Wayne and Taylor Swift.
No, a comparison is not possible between Drake’s achievements and that of The King. It’s futile. To expect more under 18-year-olds turning up at Graceland or hoping them to listen to the man’s entire catalogue is like being stuck in time. The real importance of Elvis lives on... it’s about how he reshaped the modern music industry and inspired countless musicians before leaving the building. That’s his lasting legacy. There will be, from time to time, some different takes to his music, like what we have seen with A Little Less Conversation or Rubberneckin’. Hits like Heartbreak Hotel and Jailhouse Rock will continue to get featured on soundtracks. What Drake’s achievement shows is the story of two music industries. What Elvis continues to show 43 years after his death is the degree of success a driven young man can achieve.

Pre- and post-Napster era
Ownership and streaming are worlds apart. Elvis ruled in an era when it was impossible for a person to have access to almost every other album out there but at the same time, he or she didn’t have to worry about the fact that a streaming service can pull the plug on any album.
Most streaming services were a response to Napster. Suddenly music companies saw how powerful technology could be. Without tech help, labels were drowning in piracy.
Now you have streaming services but another problem is at hand. At Neftlix or Disney there is a lot of original movie content, which is great. But look at music streaming services — they are basically the same. And going to war using pricing as a tool can take a service only that much further. That is why companies like Spotify are looking at newer avenues, like podcasts.

Radio vs playlists
August 1, 1981. MTV kicked off with the video of The Buggles singing Video Killed the Radio Star. Prophetic title indeed. The Elvis generation dependent much on RJs for their success. In July 1954 Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played That’s All Right / Blue Moon Of Kentucky and the rest is history. With streaming, life has come full circle. There was a time when record labels wanted their artistes to be heard on radio and then came MTV, but now the push comes in the form of a spot on Spotify or Apple and a place in video games. Just imagine what if Rihanna or Pharrel Williams doesn’t make it to a popular playlist! In the era of all-powerful algorithms, an artiste like Elvis would have required more marketing shakes than that of the vocal cords. Yes, playlist is king and the King obviously couldn’t imagine this at the peak of his career.
Do albums matter?
Many wouldn’t remember the last time when an album was heard in full. Sad? Well, that’s the way the industry works. For 125-year-old-plus music trade publication Billboard, compiling the weekly charts is no joke. Starting January this year — New York Times has reported — Billboard is counting the popularity of official music videos on YouTube, as well as those on Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and Vevo, in the magazine’s flagship album chart, the Billboard 200. (YouTube plays have been part of Billboard’s singles ranking, the Hot 100, since 2013.) User-generated content — like memes or cover versions — will not count. Elvis was about albums. During Elvis Week (August 9 to 17) last year in Memphis, Spotify looked at how listeners continue to love The King’s music on the streaming service. Spotify had said there was more than 16.5 million hours of streaming of Elvis music in 2019 alone and more than 2.3 million playlists based on the iconic artiste on Spotify. It said that 18-22 year-olds stream his music almost as much as listeners aged 45-59.
Top Elvis Presley songs on Spotify in 2019 were Can’t Help Falling In Love, Jailhouse Rock, Suspicious Mind, Hound Dog, Burning Love, A Little Less Conversation (JXL Radio Edit Remix), Heartbreak Hotel, Don’t Be Cruel, Blue Suede Shoes and In The Ghetto.
Top countries for streaming Elvis in 2019: USA, UK, Mexico, Brazil and Germany.
Top Elvis Christmas song: Blue Christmas.
Number of Elvis listeners on Spotify: 9.9m plus. John Lennon: Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn’t been an Elvis, there wouldn’t have been a Beatles.
Paul McCartney: When we were kids growing up in Liverpool, all we ever wanted to be was Elvis Presley.
Bruce Springsteen: There have been a lotta tough guys. There have been pretenders. And there have been contenders. But there is only one king.
Bob Dylan: When I first heard Elvis’ voice, I just knew that I wasn’t going to work for anybody; and nobody was going to be my boss…. Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail.
Elton John: Ask anyone. If it hadn’t been for Elvis, I don’t know where popular music would be. He was the one that started it all off, and he was definitely the start of it for me.
Beyonce: Elvis is iconic; a lot of performers today look to that for inspiration.
Mick Jagger: He was a unique artiste, an original in an area of imitators.
Bono: Elvis Presley is like the ‘Big Bang’ of rock ’n’ roll.
Madonna: Without Elvis you’re nothing.",culture
An army marches towards a hunger-free world on Independence Day," It was in 2014 in Hauz Khas Village in Delhi, that two friends Neel Ghose and Anand Sinha, both associated with the food startup Zomato, decided to leverage their extensive personal contacts and friends in the restaurant business and form a channel to feed those in need. Nobody could have fathomed the global footprint the Robin Hood Army (RHA) — that’s what they went on to be called — would have some day, in over 12 countries. A non-profit outfit, the RHA works on a zero-fund model where volunteers form chapters to address hunger problem in their area by distributing food from restaurants to those in need.
“By November of 2018, only four years after its inception, the RHA had served over nine million meals to less fortunate people in 103 cities across four continents, and helped more than 750 children living on the streets of India enroll into public schools. All without raising a single rupee. The RHA operated exclusively through volunteers who abided by the “golden rule” of not accepting or soliciting monetary donations” cites the Harvard Business Case Study on the RHA. Social media played a very important role in connecting and maintaining a network so strong that only grows with each passing day. The first city to join the outfit internationally was Karachi, Pakistan and in 2016, on Independence Day, the two organisations involved media, corporates and start-ups to feed 5,00,000 meals to those in need. What works for their model perhaps is the decentralisation of efforts with each chapter being responsible for their RHA spot. The fact that monetary exchange is not a part of this process, also helps. There is complete ownership of duties and volunteers have effortlessly slipped into their assigned roles to alleviate hunger. Another important reason, the founders believe that the project took off was the transparency and larger sense of ownership that appeared due to visible lack of monetary benefits of any kind.
Amidst this Covid crisis, the hunger problem worldwide has reached unfathomable scales and to mitigate even 1 per cent of the problem, the RHA has come together with a phenomenal initiative. #Mission30M was launched with the idea of serving 30 million meals to those in need by Independence Day. Of the countries that RHA operates in, 10 have participated in this mission which includes India, Bahrain, Botswana, Malaysia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Uganda. Help has also come from organisations like Godrej Group, K Corp Charitable Foundation, Akshaya Patra and BookMyShow. Around 60,000 Robins dressed in their quintessential green uniform have come forward to make this mission a success. The run up to Independence Day was being celebrated as #MissionFinale where in the last 10 days, the RHA team amped up their efforts to reach the desired goal. Extensive media outreach in the form of billboards and more have been used to inform localities about the possibility of their participation that is necessary right now to mobilise the efforts.
Speaking to The Telegraph about this mission and RHA was one of the oldest members of the team, in charge of growth and expansion — 36-year-old Sanchit Jain. “We have a very varied set of volunteers from young kids to senior citizens. But all of us do this in our free time. This world is facing one of the starkest problems it has seen in the recent past. This is not just about the 30 million meals but the bigger goal is to make every private citizen understand that this is our responsibility as well, and not just up to the government or local authorities to help fight the situation and the hope is that other citizens even outside RHA come forward to help in their area,” said Jain.
When Jain joined back in 2015, the RHA was in eight cities and now it is in 182 cities and nobody could have anticipated that the organisation would someday grow to this scale and touch so many lives, even getting a nod from Shashi Tharoor, who tweeted back in 2018, “Incredibly impressed with the passion of @rha_india & their drive to end hunger in the country. Irrespective of what our political affiliations are, I urge every Indian to come forward this Independence Day to build a hunger-free country. #MissionMillion2018”.
There was always a vision to reach a number of cities in a particular time period but the response was unfathomable. As of August 2, the RHA had served 12.5 million meals, however, the response from contributors have been less aggressive this year because of the current predicament everyone collectively finds themselves in at the moment. However, partners without the means have also managed to get together their resources and make good of promises made.
There are live updates available from various places of the mission on a platform called robinhoodarmy.com/ mission30M and rural pockets, old age homes, orphanages, daily labourers form the main audience for their programme for Independence Day.
By the time you are reading this, the RHA hopes to have touched the number of lives that it had set out to,
with a little participation from all of us.",culture
"‘The India Story Continues...’ every Saturday, starting today"," There is something endearing about the chemistry between Madhu and Harsh Neotia. Crackling. He keeps pulling her leg and she is always sporting about it. So, when we called Madhu for this chat on her upcoming venture — The India Story Continues... — she shared how Harsh tinkered with her mind this time again and went ROFL. We too LOL’d and then chatted some more about what to expect.

So The India Story is going digital with The India Story Continues…
Let me go back to how it started. During the earlier part of the lockdown, much like the others, I was spending most of my time with family, at home... a lot more than I have done all my life. I have dabbled with so many things all along that haven’t really paid as much attention to the house per se and I did see signs of neglect. So finally, I was content donning the role that I hadn’t played in the longest.
Alas, my husband (Harsh Neotia) will always tinker with my brain and he did it yet again! It was almost like the season of webinars and while we tuned into them often, he probed me to experiment on these lines for The India Story. I won’t deny I was not too keen on the format initially... well to be honest, I was for once happy to not work (chuckles).
Things however, will happen if they are meant to... right? And it just did when I chanced upon a Facebook/YouTube live session one afternoon. That perfect eureka moment when ideas roll in and add shape to the random thoughts in the mind. The fact that we may not be able to have The India Story in December this year was a further impetus for me to connect with our audience. So just like that, out of the drawing room babble emerged our first experiment in web series with The India Story Continues… inaugurating this Independence Day!

What can we expect?
We are looking at three things — conversations, performances and workshops. I have deliberated and discussed ideas with like-minded people from all over to feature them as nodal anchors for specific episodes. We have lined up 10 episodes, so let’s begin with a few episodes and see how well it is received. Modelled conventionally like a web series this is Season 1, with an episode of about 45 minutes every Saturday, beginning August 15. The basic notion has been to continue the narrative of The India Story, so you will definitely see people who have been supportive of our efforts and endeavours. This also branches as another vertical from the Neotia Arts Trust.

What can you tell us about the first session?
The first session is with a bunch of my favourites. Sandeep Khosla from Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and Raj Mahtani in conversation with Jamal Shaikh. They have all been very closely associated with The India Story and we could not have opened Season 1 with a more striking panel! Please tune in live at noon on Facebook and YouTube.
This will be followed by a tete-a-tete with Prateek Kuhad in episode 2 on the following Saturday, August 22.  

Did Parthiv, Paroma and Mr Neotia have inputs?
It was actually Mr Neotia who nudged me to think of this. Although I did not pay much heed to it, he knows exactly how to get things going in my mind (laughs). Sometimes I do wonder why people at home can’t see me relaxing and content for once! For Parthiv and Paroma, I think I have crossed their threshold of surprise. They have been so bemused through the working of it all, wondering now what is mom getting at. But if you ask about inputs and support, I have to say none of this would be possible without my young and dynamic team who made things happen seamlessly even as they worked from home.
However, you know I had done something comparable, though not similar back when we celebrated 25 years of The Conclave with the Red Sofa, where we did have conversations with Rita Bhimani over the period of a year. Naturally, with times we have evolved and now technology allows us to think beyond what is generic and conventional.

So what are you watching now?
I am watching Bandish Bandits and am mesmerised by the music. I thought Shakuntala Devi was fantastic! I also watched Aarya and Dil Bechara and loved Money Heist!

What has changed for you forever?
I have learnt the value of taking a pause. I am consciously aware of where I am and I don’t wish to rush back to the hectic schedule. I have worked breathlessly for the last two decades. It is time I feel to hone the dreams of my children and watch them soar. So yes, I want to take a break and breathe from time to time.

Classics that redefine freedom and independence," The year 2020 has increasingly been about an ever-growing list of sacrificed freedoms, to fight a pandemic. And much like every other privilege or lack thereof, these sacrifices have been subjective. While essential workers have had to struggle for survival and basic food and shelter, a missed birthday party or personal milestone has been cause for concern for many. Staying under complete lockdown, the redefining of freedom and what it means to be truly free, has been contemplated by most at some really conscious or deeply subconscious level and we thought there couldn’t be a better opportunity than this Independence Day to dive right amidst the classical masters of the written word and understand the various faces of freedom.
Peruvian Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa’s The Feast of the Goat documenting and also fictionalising the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in Dominican Republic, is a haunting crossfire of three different narrations that questions freedom in its various forms. Urania Cabral, who has left her past behind only to return to it, physically as well as emotionally, recounts her trauma and a secret that she has kept for decades. However, the other two narratives comprise of Trujillo’s life and the sychophants who constitute it and that of his assassins who have been wronged by the dictator at some point. To each and every character, freedom is a need governed by their oppressive environment and not social diktats. The pace of the novel picks speed as the imminent arrival and subsequent plan of his assassination of ‘the Goat’, as Trujillo is called, approaches. The social, personal, gender, racial and power politics play out in every page of the novel, making it the perfect companion to gather a deeper understanding of the possible meaning of ‘freedom’.
A fictional piece on freedom with politics at the helm, reminds one of George Orwell’s 1984 as well as he writes about surveillance culture and totalitarianism of the most cruel kind. While we firmly believe that it is always a great time to read 1984, we can’t help but realise how much this book resonates with the times. No better way to understand censorship achieved subtly, like someone slowly pulling the rug from under you, than an evening with Orwell.
It is difficult to write a book on freedom without grasping the deep-rooted binary understanding of gender politics, in regards to women and when speaking of the welfare of women, and one can’t stray too far from Virginia Woolf and her collected essays in A Room of One’s Own. In her inimitable style, Woolf finds freedom for female writers within the confines of four walls. A radical text of her times, this feminist literature is a lesson waiting to be learnt. The importance of a physical space to fight the good fight of occupying the figurative space in an industry led by men, she speaks of publishing and fiction by women. “Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind,” she writes, immortalising a thought in a heartbreakingly poignant manner.
Along similar lines lie Arthur Golden’s Memoirs of a Geisha which recounts Chiyo Sakamoto’s journey from a sold-off maid to Sayuri, a top geisha who finds love in a stranger on the streets of Tokyo. Golden’s tale is equal parts serious, heartwarming and empowering with an overwhelming celebration of finding freedom in love.
One obviously has to think of Anne Frank’s The Diary of a Young Girl while writing about women and freedom. Spending two years in captivity of the worst kind, young Anne’s tale of depravity from a point in history, has inspired generations and will continue to do so. Suitable for young children, this book should be a part of the syllabus to give them a clear understanding of concepts of physical movement and their privileges in a war-torn land.
Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn also comes to mind while imagining unadulterated freedom of the best kind. What could be freer than running away from home? As Huck Finn is taken captive by his father and travels along the Mississippi river, we can’t help but imagine being a part of the adventures of his life. Satirical in places, the novel is worth revisiting at any given point in life.
A lot of authors have equated the thought of freedom with a physical activity of sorts but no one quite touches the heart like the elusive author Haruki Murakami. In his book What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, he writes about the process of running and his journey from one marathon to the other, sprinkled with memories of his encounters on this journey. A slight insight into the life of the reticent author, the physical act of running is a metaphor for the life we lead, where every moment can be an act of rebellion. Only Murakami can weave a memoir, travelogue and mundane technicalities in the life of athletes into one book, so perfectly.
Metaphors and their frequent usage also make us think of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead where the very act of existing on your own terms defines freedom to Howard Roark, the iconic architect from Rand’s fiction that the world collectively fell in love with. Rebelling against ostentatious shows of arrogance in architecture, Roark creates to serve himself and the greater purpose that he has been asked to serve. Roark, as a character and his ability to exist and fight, defines freedom better than complete books on the subject.
Few more classics we can’t help but think of on this topic would definitely be Solomon Northup’s 1853 account Twelve Years a Slave, the movie of which swept the awards season in 2019; Tennessee William’s The Glass Menagerie and Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom.
If diving into a pile of old classics this Independence Day is your plan, be prepared to realise that the very idea of freedom and independence is a varied lived experience for everyone and to figure out how to define yours, take a little help of the masters!",culture

Listening to freedom tales," If you are ever feeling low, you should dial someone like Anjali Lama. The transgender model from a farming family in Nepal, is like a shot of positivity. After a decade of struggle, Anjali now has on her CV names like Manish Malhotra and Sabyasachi Mukherjee. The same ‘boy’ who would cry after getting kicked out of restaurant jobs for his mannerisms, is now a flagbearer of equality and genuine talent. “I have always felt like a girl from within and played the dulhan in bride-and-groom games. I have got teased in school and mentally tortured… I tried to be a boy and act like one… but it was not meant to be. I decided to be myself,” Anjali tells The Telegraph over the phone from Mumbai. Her mantra? Keep working hard and unexpected joys will follow.

Since when have you nurtured the dream of becoming a model?
I am from a remote village in Nepal where people have no idea about modelling and fashion. On completing my school education, I went to Kathmandu for a job and everybody would tell me I look like a model. I really had no idea what it meant and would just smile. Later, when I disclosed my identity in 2005 and went to the community, my trans sisters also encouraged me a lot. They said I had a beautiful face and a good body. So, modelling just happened to me.
In 2009, I got the opportunity to become the cover girl of a magazine being a trans. That’s when I decided to be a model.

It’s taken you 10 years…
A lot of people think that I have achieved a lot in just three years. I have struggled a lot and have faced numerous rejections. Lakme Fashion Week didn’t give me a chance just because I was a trans and you should provide them with a platform. I am capable and I have what it takes to be a good model. It’s not about your gender, but about the job and its requirements. I competed with 200-300 regular models and then got selected. I cracked the auditions on the third go, in 2017. I came back home and had a dialogue with my mirror: ‘Sach mein main select ho gayee. Oh my god!’ It felt like a dream, but, even after Lakme, I had my doubts how things would pan out that I was transgender. I kept trying. There have been ups and downs, but then a good agency happened and more quality work followed. I have three awards in my four years in Bombay. I am so happy, but I hadn’t expected it.  

Who has been your inspiration?  
It has always been my mother. Life mein jo bhi karna ho, agar aap galat raaste pe nahin ja rahe ho, toh kisise darna nahin chahiye. Don’t be afraid to be who you are and work hard. Ask yourself what is it that you want and what do you want to become in life. My mother would always say that keep at it and soon tough times would be over and your dreams will come true.
I think it is a gift of god ke mein kisise darti nahin hoon. I am not afraid to express myself ke main kaun hoon. A lot of people from the LGBTQ community are scared to disclose their identity. What will my family say? Where will I go? I don’t think so much. Mujhe jo chahiye woh chahiye. I am not harming anyone. Apni life jeene ke liye kisi se permission lene ki zaroorat nahin hai. My identity is my strong point.

Was the fashion industry welcoming of you?

I have faced a lot of rejections because of my identity. For two years, I didn’t have any work. Now, things are changing. It is like your five fingers. If one is discriminating, the other is giving you the opportunity. You must be positive. Even if one person is giving you the chance, lap it up because it can change your life. You have to fight for what you want. Mujhe pata tha ke main model ban sakti hoon. You should know your quality and khoobi.

And life has changed…
  Abhi bahut saare cheezein badalne baki hai. I want to be a supermodel and go international. I will keep trying. If that doesn’t happen, life will throw many more options at you.  Imagine excelling at your profession for 31-odd years. Imagine touching hundreds of lives who swear by your life-altering tips. Imagine being a supermodel even when you don’t fit in with the notions of a conventional Indian beauty. Nayanika Chatterjee tells The Telegraph about her “blessed life”.

What does freedom mean to you?
To be allowed to think the way you want and do what you want in life. Make your own decisions and stand by it. Most of the people are not allowed to make their decisions, whether good or bad, right? I have led a pretty nice life that way. From my childhood, I was encouraged to do what I wanted to do, even if it was a haircut. I have also had the luxury to be able to make my own decisions even financially. I have lived with my parents for most of my modelling career and then my husband. I have not had that kind of pressure. That also helped me have the freedom to make my own decisions and do what I want. I could take that risk. I have had a blessed life. I have been able to come this far because of the support of everyone, which is very important.

Were you conscious of the way you looked because of what people said?
Of course. I never grew up feeling that I was beautiful or pretty. I was different and I was funny and jovial. So, I got along with people. I never looked in the mirror and said: ‘Oh my god!’, when I was growing up. I was very unconventional looking. My parents are both fair with sharp features and by the time I saw them, they were pretty well-groomed also. Wherever they went, there was a constant comparison. First of all, the (skin) colour. Then I was unusually tall and I had this Afro kind of hair. There were constant comments like ‘She won’t get married’, ‘Etai tomader meye? E ki kore hoi bolo toh?’
When I started modelling, initially, I didn’t believe that it was because of something in me. I thought it was just my luck. Till today. I don’t think I am beautiful but I have a personality and I have groomed myself well. That’s why I give so much importance to grooming. I think I have my own space that I have managed to create. The universe has also helped me a lot. A lot of what I am is because of this industry. I have learnt so much and it has enriched me as a person.

But you look so international…
There wasn’t much media awareness at that time. What was happening in Paris, we would only hear after a few months. The British had left a couple of decades before I was born. So, that hang-up was there je phorsha hole bhalo.

Do you think girls have it much more easier now?
The whole industry has opened up and are now accepting all kinds of people. Our generation of models has paved the way. That has helped everyone.

What do you tell the girls you groom?
You cannot compare yourself to others. I can only see destruction there. Imagine being surrounded by beautiful people and if you are going to constantly think ‘Oh I am not as good as her’, it will kill you. You must realise that this is what I am and I am lucky to be able to have this opportunity and now how good can I get so that I can keep the opportunity and take it further.

Is your daughter Kiara Nayantara conscious of her looks?
This generation is more obsessed with their looks than we were because of social media. Also because they get so much reiteration from social media that they feel what we have advised… anyway very few kids say ja ma baba bolbey, tai korbo! Aamio korini. Aamar bachchao korbe na. I tell her but I can’t force. She is too old to be forced to do anything if she doesn’t want to. You can protect them from harm but not failure. You can warn. So, she has to follow her own path. Ushoshi Sengupta remembers every moment of the night when Sushmita Sen got home the Miss Universe crown. She was six and she made Miss India her passion. “Modelling happened,” says Ushoshi who went on to become Miss Universe India in 2010. Her beautiful, brown skin tone and her cascading curls are her USP. “Be proud of who you are,” she says.

Your profession mostly demands that you look a certain way and you are known for your unconventional looks. What has been this navigation like?
In the beginning it felt difficult like everyone else, but with every small little step of success that I kept getting, I realised that it was so unique and because it was so unique, people were so inquisitive about what I do and the kind of path I was taking.
I realised I was unconventional very early in my career because people kept saying so. For me being unconventional was not new. I grew up with a name ‘Ushoshi’ and I think I was the only Ushoshi in school. I grew up in Gujarat and people struggled with my name. I was the first daughter in my family in 81 years. I always knew I was special and in my head, I knew that I was meant to do something special.
People who know me well, know that I live in my own world and there, I am always the queen. So, I have never really needed any appreciation from the outside world. I have a strong will and being a fauji kid, it was never difficult for me to blend in or stand out.

Sushmita Sen’s Miss India and Universe crownings were memorable moments for you...
I remember watching the crownings on a small black-and-white TV on Doordarshan... still so fresh in my mind. My father’s eyes were all lit up and he was glued to the TV. I asked him what it meant and he said she was the most beautiful and intelligent girl in the world today. That night I got a dream and I knew I wanted to do this. My life had a purpose and I have always worked towards a goal and everything I have done has eventually led me towards leading that life for myself.

You have also met the right people at the right time...
I was extremely lucky. I auditioned for Sananda Tilottama and I was the first runner-up in 2008 and I have never had to look back. I was working with the best and have never really had to struggle. Getting mentored by Nayanika Chatterjee and getting on the cover of t2 is every model’s dream and I started with that.
When I went to Miss India (I Am She spearheaded by Sushmita Sen), I knew that it will only happen to people who would really want it. That night, I might not have been the most deserving girl, but I really wanted it the most. My stars were aligned. One of the biggest motivations for me was I would be representing India (at Miss Universe). If not Miss India, I would have been an air-force pilot. A lot of people have told me to move to Paris or New York and try because I am such a fierce face, but that was not my dream for myself.
There were pageants too where I didn’t place, but for me, it was about trying one more time. I think I inherit my conviction from my dad. As a defence kid, I had learned not to give up on my dreams easily. You have to be responsible for every decision you take and you really regret the dreams that you don’t chase.

Were you ever made to feel bad about your offbeat looks?
Not for the way I look, but I did face a lot of resistance for the colour of my skin. Miss India was about conventional Indian beauty... fair skin and straight hair. I was pole opposite. A lot of industry people told me I wasn’t suitable for Miss India and why don’t I try a, for example, Gladrags instead. Yes, there were times when I did feel bad and I was obsessed about using whitening skin cream and I would sit down and think why wasn’t I fair.
Then Tilottama happened and it was a big deal for someone like me to place there. It was a big boost for my confidence and it was so reassuring.
The more you experience, the more aware you are. Slowly and steadily, I recovered from my insecurity. The only message I would give is, you have no idea how much brown skin is celebrated across the world. Your features make you.  She started modelling at 32, after her marriage, dropping down from a whopping 92kg to 54kg. Runa Laha. The first runner-up crown at Sananda Srimati happened in 2009, followed by a stint with Elite India and Kingfisher model hunt in 2012. At 42, Runa’s never-say-never spirit has just about started to soar.    

Where do you derive this strength to live life on your own terms?
One of my mother’s aunts often used to say that all men are sholo aana and all women are two pices down. It stayed with me and this was when I had not even crossed double digits. I would wonder why is she saying so. It would bother me why couldn’t my mother take a decision on her own and why would she always need my father’s stamp of approval. Having said that my dad would always keep a window of discussion open. Aami shei jaigata peyechhi. I have never considered anything to be the universal truth.

You started modelling at 32 and does the same spirit of enquiry make you question that why can’t a 40-year-old compete with a 20-year-old?
Exactly. Where is the clash? Why would people ask me this question in the first place. I take immense pride in it. It is very easy to look youthful when you are young, but when your collagen is depleting, it is challenging to look youthful. When I get to hear things like: ‘Your son (Om) is 15?! What are you saying?! You are a Santoor mom!’ I have worked hard on myself... my mental well-being and physical health.
Also, just because I am a working mom, am I a bad mom? I just want to say there are no clashes. If you know how to handle each role and have command over your managerial skills, you can achieve anything.

Has the journey been difficult?
It’s difficult if you think it’s difficult. I have done things which I felt were right. I just take a plunge considering it my job.

You’ve also had to take some tough decisions to be where you are...
Very tough. Om was six when I left Calcutta for three years, first for Delhi and then Bombay. My husband took over then completely.

In hindsight, do you thank god you took it?
Of course. A tough mother raises a tough kid. I have secured my son emotionally. He doesn’t seek emotional refuge in anyone.

Do you often think about a day when he might ask you why you had left him...
We fight a lot, almost like Tom and Jerry. We are both Gemini. I told him once that I was glad that I took that decision and I have no regrets. I wouldn’t have liked to live with the fact that I have had to sacrifice because of my family and kid. This weighs down relationships. I didn’t want to live with the sense of guilt and didn’t wish it on him either.
He can handle his own situations without any drama. I can show him the path but he has to walk on it alone.

What is your message for those who are age-obsessed?
If you have the youthful looks of a 20-year-old and the maturity of a 40-year-old, then it is killer. No one can fool you. Life is wow after 40. People say life begins at 40 and I could never fathom till I turned 40. I know what I need.",culture
Artists who are putting India on the global art map," Since history started immortalising the earliest of etchings as the beginning of recording art in the subcontinent, India’s artistic gamut and glory today is a wide horizon dotted with many spectacular names and their priceless contributions. From the historical Dancing Girl statuette of Mohenjo Daro and art dictated by dynasties such as the Cholas and Guptas, to Mughal minutiae, Raja Ravi Varma’s calendar art, the Bengal School of Art spurred by the nationalistic movement and later, the Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group birthing a tectonic shift in post-colonial India — Indian art as we know it now is the result of the painstaking work of many. Incidentally, India’s portfolio of art is as diverse as the country itself, drawing from multiple influences and pivoting around historic incidents and as we live out 2020, I do not think it is prophetic of me to say that we are at one such juncture that will beget many important artworks as an expression of our troubled times.
Contemporary artists in India today are addressing important issues of identity, gender and politics through the art that they put out, which is often through social media, virtual exhibitions by galleries or at national and international art fairs. This, in turn, has led to a wider audience and often helps in triggering pertinent conversations. Therefore we thought it relevant to list the names of a few artists that should be on an art lover’s radar for putting India on the global art map. But just like beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, the appreciation of art must come with the proviso of that being subjective, which is imperative, especially, to state at the beginning of a compendium such as this. And with that out of the way, here is a list of artists who, among many more, can be credited for drawing art-loving eyes to India: 

Anish Kapoor
Knighted by the British and awarded the Padma Bhushan in India, British-Indian artist Anish Kapoor is the pride of both countries. The 66-year-old artist whose reference to “negative space” or “the void” is probably what is at the heart of his art and is a preoccupation so great for the artist that he also licensed Vantablack (considered to be the blackest black) exclusively for his own use, much to the ire of the rest of the art world. His work revolves around his intellectual interests in blood and the female anatomy and his works are often high on drama. The Turner Prize-winning artist currently has his mind-bending Sky Mirror installation on display at Norfolk’s Houghton Hall.

Bose Krishnamachari
Individual accomplishments aside, this Mumbai-based artist who is the recipient of the Life Time Fellowship Award by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, out of many more awards, perhaps should be most credited for being the founder-member and president of the Kochi Biennale Foundation that organises the Kochi-Muziris Biennale (KMB). This is the largest art exhibition of India that draws thousands of art lovers from across the world to the sea-port town of Kochi, every two years in December. KMB plays host to hundreds of national and international contemporary artists, thereby bolstering attention for the works of many. Bose’s personal style of art comprises “vivid abstract paintings, figurative drawings, sculpture, photography, multimedia installations and architecture” and he most recently held his first solo exhibition after nine long years, titled The Mirror Sees Best in the Dark that was on view at the Kolkata Centre for Creativity. Dayanita Singh
Delhi-based Dayanita Singh’s form of art predominantly uses the medium of photography in the format of a book, with the one capturing Zakir Hussain at practice and on tour being one of her most famous. Her photo-books are of the elevation of visual novels that play with storytelling through both books and photography. Singh has multiple works, collaborations, awards and showcases to her name, both at national and international levels and has exhibited at prestigious biennales and museums such as Tate Modern, London; Asia Society, New York and the Venice Biennale.

Shilpa Gupta
An alumna of Sir JJ School of Art, Mumbai-based Shilpa Gupta concerns herself with human perception and the influence of knowledge on it and uses mediums such as video, performances and found objects. She continues to trace “the defining power of social and psychological borders on public life” and with works such as In Our Times (2008), Untitled (Wives of the Disappeared) (2006) and Singing Cloud (2008), she has exploded various issues related to the same themes and has used multiple mediums to do so. Most recently, her For, In Your Tongue, I Cannot Fit (2018) at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, attempted to give a voice to 100 poets who were silenced by imprisonment and was also shown at the prestigious Venice Biennale last year, through which she questioned the fragility and vulnerability of India’s freedom of expression, especially in present times. Atul & Anju Dodiya
Any discussion on contemporary art is incomplete without the mention of the Mumbai-based Dodiyas. While Atul is known for his relevant, kitschy art, Anju is known for her practice that often delves into her own internal experiences as an artist. Yet both are united in the critical acclaim that they have garnered over the years and their multiple national and international showings, including at the Venice Biennale and the Tate Modern between the two of them. The Dodiyas are distinct and different in their practices but have a pronounced Indian touch to their styles and topics, which they have been putting forth to their global audiences consistently for years.",culture
"Art, physical space and conversations thereof"," To exhibit or not to exhibit, that is the question dominating art in the time of Covid-19.
Ina Kaur has a definitive answer. “Art is subtle and tactile, it is necessary to be able to converse with art in a physical space,” said the Bangalore-based artist.
She is one of the six contemporary artists being shown at the CIMA Gallery’s “Mixed Media”, the first full-fledged, physical art exhibition in Calcutta since the March lockdown.
Mixed Media, displaying 56 artworks that explore the awareness of simple everyday life and the relationship between “man and nature and the nature of man”, took a long time to plan and put together because of the lockdown and all the constraints that came with it. Artists were finding it difficult to access material for their work and many couldn’t get to their studios. There were logistical issues of getting the artworks to Calcutta, with courier services being closed, and restrictions on what would be allowed in and what wouldn’t.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM “But we were adamant about going ahead with the exhibition. The hurdles we faced are those we have to live with for the near future and we have to prepare ourselves accordingly,” said Rakhi Sarkar, director of CIMA.
Mixed Media, which also showcases artworks by Kingshuk Sarkar, Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar, Shreyasi Chatterjee, Soham Gupta and Vishal Bhand, opened to the public on August 7 at the Ballygunge gallery and will be on for a month.
For Shreyasi Chatterjee, her own artworks acquire a new meaning in the physical gallery space. “When I am working, I am deeply involved with the artwork. Without an exhibition you cannot understand your place among the other artists and artworks showcased. You also experience your own artwork in a new way when you see it curated in a gallery space,” said Chatterjee, explaining how one piece of work (titled Birthday Present), which she felt was childish, did not really seem that way when viewed within the exhibition. Priyanka Raja, co-founder of Experimenter Gallery, is unequivocal on the importance of displaying art in a physical space. “Viewing art on an online platform is not the same experience at all because there you are twice removed from reality. For the artists also it will never be enough to be present in the 2D format,” said Raja.
Experimenter, which has remained active through various virtual shows during the lockdown, has also curated a show at its Ballygunge Place address. Called Four Positions, the exhibition showcases solo projects of four artists -- Krishna Reddy, Ayesha Sultana, Julien Segard and Rathin Barman. At present the show is open to the public by prior appointment only but it will be open to all from August 21. For Raja, the biggest challenge has been adapting to the hi-tech sanitisation processes, social distancing norms and wearing protective gear. “It has been a whole new world of fitting in and learning to work within the parameters of the new normal,” she said.
For Sarkar, working to remotely curate Mixed Media presented challenges of its own, in addition to organising sanitisation gear, thermal scanners, masks, face shields and gloves in tune with Covid safety protocols.
“Selecting work online becomes difficult because you can’t understand the scale. Curating it is also a challenge when you are mounting an exhibition through video conferencing,” said Sarkar. Why then not just opt for virtual displays like so many galleries around the world are doing?
“You can’t appreciate the texture, the tactileness, the scale of an artwork on a virtual platform. It can give you a rough idea but not the whole picture so to speak,” said Sarkar.
The artists sure think so too. “I have a lot of big works and I can imagine them all together but the only way I can see them together is at an exhibition like this,” said Kaur, adding that artists anyway spend a lot of time alone in their studio space creating the artworks in order to “share and connect”, which is exactly what an exhibition allows them to do. Not to say that the virtual does not have its virtues. “More people can see the artworks and you can zoom into a painting and notice a lot more details,” said Sarkar.
The virtual platform has enabled the dialogue to be kept alive despite the pandemic. “The virtual presence has made art accessible to far more people. The number of hits we have had on the shows we have curated online are a proof of that,” said Raja.
Mixed Media is seeing a slow trickle of people at CIMA and Sarkar expects the numbers to go up in the coming weeks. Sale of artwork is not of immediate concern for either CIMA or Experimenter, as that primarily happens remotely, through enquiries online. Just like the CIMA website, that has the artworks and details of the Mixed Media exhibition and a virtual walk-through video, Experimenter’s Four Positions will also have an online presence in a viewing room format.
“Going forward art will occupy a hybrid space with a mix of the physical and the virtual and the success of a show will no longer be measured by how many people came to the opening but by how many people you can reach out to,” said Raja.
And for some artists, looking within in order to reach out seems to be a thematic thread of lockdown times. “The artworks showcased in Mixed Media are visceral and reflective of the inner hopes and despair,” said Sarkar.
One of Kaur’s works in the exhibition, Disentangled, came about during, and in response to, the pandemic. It was triggered by a personal loss but grew to encapsulate the larger loss of freedom of humanity and of nature. The material she has used is rudimentary and recycled from what she had at hand at her home studio.
“I don’t see this as a compromise but rather an opportunity to be resourceful,” said Kaur.",culture
Ranveer Allahbadia on cracking the code of social media influencing...," From an engineering college student to having 2.02 million subscribers on YouTube, RanveerAllahbadia has made a name for himself with podcasts and videos about fashion, grooming, etiquette, meditation, mental health awareness, communication skills and entrepreneurship. The 27-year-old based out of Mumbai started his journey with fitness videos on his page BeerBiceps. He also hosts The Ranveer Show on his YouTube page which has featured the likes of Prateek Kuhad, Priyanka Chopra, Luke Coutinho, Saif Ali Khan, Rajkummar Rao and even his idol Arnold Schwarzenegger. A t2 chat with the podcaster who co-founded digital entertainment start-up Monk Entertainment with Viraj Sheth.

You started your YouTube channel by uploading fitness videos in 2014. Did you think you would come this far?
I expected more from myself honestly. I always feel like I’ve kind of underachieved because my goal has always been to also have a business set-up outside of YouTube. So I always feel like I’m on the path but I have a lot more to do.

The name BeerBiceps is quite ironical for a fitness page…
Back in the day, I always thought it was going to be a fitness channel so I always wanted to promote the idea of not getting obsessed with fitness; it has to be balanced. My way of preaching balance was that you should also party. Hence the name but eventually people started thinking that I’m calling myself BeerBiceps so it became a brand name and even though I wanted to change it over the years I can’t because people associate with it.

Under the BeerBiceps page is also The Ranveer Show which did well on Spotify podcast charts. That must have been a big step....
Yeah, so podcasts are a big part of my future plans for the next five years at least, bringing a lot of international celebrities to Indian audiences and taking Indian celebrities to international audiences. We kind of grew it like an international podcast; we stopped the Indian charts. We just wanted to tap into the knowledge that a lot of successful people have gained over their lifetime.

What would you say makes your podcasts different from the ones that speak on similar topics?
Honestly, I do have that YouTube fan base, so that’s a huge reason that my podcasts have stood out, it’s got that readymade audience. If you want to run a podcast, in this country especially, you have to have presence on another platform, Instagram or Reddit at least. Podcast by themselves are an art. There is a way of capturing your listener’s attention and a way of making it more interesting through content.

As a podcaster how on point do you have to be with your content and how careful do you have to be with what you’re saying to so many listeners?

There is a learning curve involved. Honestly, the first 10  episodes weren’t all that great but it’s become better over time. Like there are topics people find interesting, there are guests people want to see… Even during a solo podcast it’s about the pauses you take, the gaps between certain words... all these little things matter. It’s a little complicated but you get better at the art form.

With the global pandemic keeping everyone indoors does it become a challenge for a YouTuber or podcaster to create content?
Initially the challenge was to figure our system; how we’re going to transfer data from our PC to the editor’s PC. There was a lot to do back then. I haven’t got a break in a long time, so it is difficult to motivate yourself to work every day because you see everyone around is kind of taking a step back. But for content creators this time is crucial to create as much content as possible because you’re sowing the seeds of the future.

You also did a show with Arnold Schwarzenegger. How did that happen?
So Disney contacted us and they knew that I’ve spoken about him in many of my videos in the past. They flew us down to Korea where I got a good few minutes with him. I told them (Arnold Shwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton) my story about how some of his speeches and video content helped me come out of some dark places in terms of mental health. He told me that he is proud of me and that has been the highlight of my life till date.
 
You are quite vocal about mental health awareness and did a show with Priyanka Chopra about the same. Given the situation, how are you keeping well with it?
First, I needed to find out if it is something going wrong biologically. Traditionally speaking, Indians are really tough when it comes to mental health issues. But what I have done is eliminate the wrong people from my life, limited my interaction with those who cause any negative effects on me. Second, I practise daily meditation and am regular with my fitness cycle. This has helped me immensely. Both these activities release a massive amount of dopamine in the bloodstream that pick me up from the lowest of phases.
 
Speaking as the co-founder of Monk Entertainment, how did you crack the code to social media influencing and marketing?
If you have done YouTube or Instagram or any of these things for a while, you start understanding the pattern. You’re able to crack codes, you know what will do well, you know which influencers to work with and understand brand requirements and therefore make customised campaigns. But you have to have some kind of preconceived learning.",culture
Tashfee writes about how she overcame the odds," My entry into the industry was quite abrupt actually. At the age of eight, my mother noticed that I was interested in singing, so she found a local music teacher for me. I had good sense of music and so the teacher made me play the harmonium for the class. But when I wanted to sing, she told me I did not have a “good tone” to sing, so I was eventually kicked out of the class. Then when I was 15, I wanted to perform at this small ceremony at a camp I was at. But no one had heard me sing before and so they did not want me to sing. I cried and made a scene, till they allowed me to sing; I completely bombed that one!
The point is, throughout my youth, my relationship with music was that of an avid listener; I never visualised myself as a performing singer. I never in my dreams thought that the musicians I was listening to would one day welcome me as a fellow performer!

The new way
One problem was the scarcity of female role model musicians when I was growing up. I am not a trained singer. I am not a classical singer or a folk singer. In fact, I was a metalhead! Given the kind of music I was interested in singing, whose path was I supposed to follow? I am grateful for the handful of powerful female vocalists that were there at least, such as Anusheh Anadil, Elita Karim, Mila, Armeen Musa, Mehreen, Simin Saifuddin, Jisha Sarwar, Alif Alauddin etc. And then when Chirkutt and Lalon came later, both were major role models. When Anusheh Anadil released the album with her band Bangla called Kingkortobbobimur I remember how amazed everyone was. Her deep iconic voice is absolutely revolutionary. But still — boys, they had role models in every genre, for every instrument, but for girls, it was much more limited. This is a fight we are still fighting. The beginning of a journey
In my early 20s, a guitarist friend suggested me to join a local choir group. I was hesitant at first, because of my past experiences with music. But I was also going through a particularly tough time in my life, and so this seemed like a healthy pursuit. I decided to give it a shot. I remember how impressed the music composer was when he first heard me sing. And that inspired me massively. And that’s when my journey in the music industry officially started.
I used to hang out in the studio a lot, recording a lot of covers. Particularly, I covered a song by Beyonce and uploaded it on SoundCloud. I picked a Beyonce song specifically because I thought it would be a very difficult song to cover, and I wanted to try something challenging.
I uploaded it on SoundCloud, but was too shy to share it anywhere else.
The composer I was working with forced me to share it on Facebook.  That’s when a lot of people first got to know about me. I began doing television and radio shows and jingles, and working with some of the top musicians and composers of the country.
Once I made my way in the industry, it was difficult for my family to accept their daughter choosing a career in music. I think it is typical for a non-musical Bangladeshi middle-class family to have certain pre-conceived negative notions attached to this idea of a musician’s lifestyle, and so I always feel the need to be extra transparent with my parents to make sure they are comfortable with my career choice.
Figuring out the look
My next struggle was learning to maintain a certain look. Male artistes generally do not have to put so much thought into their ensemble, but female artistes are required to look rather impeccable, and it can be rather stressful. My job was not just to sing, but also look glamorous. I have never been one for fine dresses and elaborate make-up, so this was a puzzle I learned to solve as well.

Dealing with trolling
Another thing I had to figure out as I went along was cyberbullying. There are many good aspects of social media when it comes to expression of any kind of art form, but dealing with a lot of negative comments — especially as women trying to succeed in a male-dominated industry — is tough. Realistically, there’s no way of controlling that.
I often have to deal with vicious bodyshaming. I try not to let those comments get to me anymore, but it’s never easy to deal with. Cyberbullies need to understand that we are people too. We see and deal with cruelty just like any other person. Now that it has become a part of the job description, I think growing a thick skin and not letting it get to you is the only way to deal with cyberbullying.
Recently I started exploring classic Bangladeshi rock. I did a cover of Taray taray by James (Feelings), and Shafin Ahmed from Miles liked it enough to ask me to join him in performing his band’s Jaadu with him. Both these songs are very close to my heart, and I sang them to the best of my abilities.
Thankfully, I mostly received positive comments; the few negative comments I did receive were from men out there who I felt were simply uncomfortable with this idea of these songs being sung by a female voice, with a female interpretation, female emotions. I think a certain portion of the audience were not used to the idea. In fact, this paved the way for conceptualising the theme for my upcoming album.
It is very rare to find rock songs written by and sung from the female perspective. Songs of heartbreak are always from a male perspective, written and sung by men. But heartbreaks are not exclusively a male experience! I know heartbreak well. That is what I want to explore further in my next venture.

Diversity through social media
There has been an exponential change in the industry culture. The dominant commercial media platforms were television and radio. These platforms had a gatekeeping process that would allow only a certain kind of a human being through. This certain kind of a human being had to look a certain way and talk a certain way. The definitions for grace and presentability were narrow, and even though talent was important, it was not a self-sufficient factor.
What changed only within a decade or so is the advent and absolute cultural penetration of the social media platform. Social media is allowing all sorts of humans, looking all sorts of ways, taking up space and telling all sorts of stories. It is no more a unilateral narrative. If commercial platforms do not allow a certain kind of a person who has creative contributions to make, that person is building their own base and using their own social media platform to take up screen space.
This allows for diversity and greater representation, and this lets us be honest in our art. In fact, it is almost like we are living in a culture of expressive vulnerability. It is completely okay now to come online and talk to the world about personal struggles, and in fact, it is lauded since people can identify with it. When I was growing up, some of the role models were too good to be true, and not relatable. The most positive thing about the industry right now is how the women are very supportive of each other.
The music industry has definitely evolved over the years. But at the end of the day, if you ask me if I would choose any other profession, my answer would be “never!”. I love to sing, I love my job despite the negatives. It comes with its challenges, and I would not change it for the world. ",culture
Three of India’s top models on life amidst a pandemic," The initial days of lockdown
I was working back to back before Covid hit us. So, it was great in the sense that everything calmed down. It gave me a lot of time to spend with my family, which probably hasn’t happened for so long. You are also completely focussed within. Though it’s been disastrous for many in many ways… for the first two months, it was great. My husband was here. Post that I have been giving a lot of interviews and have been talking on Instagram about the future of fashion. There was so much of pending work left. I sorted a lot of trash out of my house. I have been working a lot on sustainability and conscious fashion. So, basically everything that I have ever wanted to do and that would never come along because I was constantly travelling and working... I did utilise it well (laughs).

Professional apprehensions
This has happened to everyone. Yes, the fashion industry is one of the worst hit and I know that things are going to change, but I also know that we as human beings are resilient enough to come back and we as Indians are resilient enough to come back even stronger. I have started doing a few shoots. Of course everything is being done very professionally. I did the Tarun Tahiliani virtual show, which was done very professionally. Slowly shoots are happening. I don’t think shows are going to happen very soon. Everybody is going to start working on the virtual format. This also gave me the time to start working on own company. So, yes, I have plans! I have always been very calm and collected and I believe that everything has a reason and time. I have been telling the freshers what they need to do to up their game, the ones who are trying to enter the industry. I know of girls who have given up their houses as they are not been able to pay rent and people who are struggling and going through depression and I have been talking about how to handle it. This gives us time to work on ourselves and increase our talent base and not depend on modelling alone as a job. A model can be a fabulous influencer and blogger as well. A lot of models are now doing styling and make-up videos.

The Tarun Tahiliani show
My only apprehension was about the safety standards. I knew I was ready for work. (At the set), everybody was wearing the right kit. We were advised to get our own food. The brief was different. We had only about six models in the show. Every little thing was sanitised.
For the first time in my life, I was relieved that the crowd was missing (laughs out loud). In my head, I was like, ‘I touched this and I need to sanitise’. I think I must have scraped off my hands with the sanitiser that day. I knew there were three-four cameras on us, but, I must tell you, it was so much fun. You are looking amazing and you are without a mask (in so many months)… (laughs). The fittings was one girl at a time. There were no rehearsals. My fittings was done in one hour. It is usually five hours. It was actually easier. I might get used to this honestly! (Laughs) It was recorded. Tarun told us to be ourselves. My first feelings when I walked out was hallelujah! Thank god!

My anchor
My family. Finally I gave them the time they deserve. I am lucky to have my family around me. I have always believed throughout my career that it is very important to have a balance between work and personal life. I have held by the believe and it has proved good to me during these tough times. And, my friends... I have been speaking to each of them. The initial days of lockdown

When it got shut down, I was in shock honestly. I was preparing myself for Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week (presented by FDCI) and I was about two days away from travelling for it. I was supposed to go to Jaipur and then I got a message that the Fashion Week has been postponed. During Lakme Fashion Week, we were hearing about coronavirus and that it was spreading crazily. We were scared but had no idea that this was something so serious. When events started to get postponed, it was a bit weird and a little scary and slowly more jobs started getting cancelled. March is the peak season for us. It was badly hit. We thought things would get back to normal in a month or so and that a cure would be out soon. Then you just realised it’s going to take more time.

Professional apprehensions
There is not much work happening in Bombay because if you talk about fashion, Delhi has a lot of designers. Bombay is more commercial, TV and all of that. I have my base both in Bombay and Delhi. I have moved to Delhi now where my cousin lives, for work, because it keeps you going. And, the rents are very high in Bombay. When you are not earning much, it doesn’t make sense to pay that rent. Now you are not earning too much, but you are not spending too much either. I haven’t shopped for anything in these months, which is strange, no eating out, no vacations.
I have done a show recently for Tarun Tahiliani. That’s one of my first jobs after four months. Crazy.

Unprecedented times
We were all going through mixed emotions. There is so much happening. You are on social media 24x7. There is nothing else to distract you. I have been trying to meditate and stay positive, doing a lot of yoga, but you still can’t help it. It’s out there. We have started respecting things we never paid attention to before. Stepping out and having coffee is a very casual thing. When I went out for coffee after five months, I felt like crying!

The Tarun Tahiliani show
We loved it. It was not even 10 per cent of the crew that’s usually there at fashion shows. Usually the green room has all the female models, but this time they put us in different cabins. We were talking to each other through glass screens, which was weird. When we were doing the videos, we didn’t know how it’s going to look. It was more like a rehearsal for us, but when we watched the show, it looked exactly like a fashion show, as if we were walking there.

Alternative career options
I want to do something in the creative space, but I am not sure what. I wanted to get into fitness. Now you have to come up with new ideas as the world is changing. I am spending a lot of time making DIYs and have started painting, art and craft. Sometimes I feel like painting and sometimes, writing or learning a new instrument, but the biggest motivation is that the vaccine should be out. (Laughs)  The initial days of lockdown
We moved out of Bombay (Mitali is married to Calcutta boy Avishek Das) thinking this would happen and it did. I don’t think anybody expected it to go on for so long. There were speculations in the beginning that it probably wouldn’t end in the next six months. It sounded like: ‘What are you saying?! How can we sit at home for six months?’ So, it’s about living in fear every day because now people you know are getting it.

Professional apprehensions
I think we are independent women, paying our own bills. So, for me it was a bit of a shocker that for the next few months, I won’t be working. We get paid on every job and we don’t have a fixed income. When work starts, we are the ones who will be called back first because people won’t forget you easily. Work was never my concern and it has started. Quite a few friends of mine in Delhi have been working every other day in shoots. You can’t expect shows to happen now. I have got some queries, but I don’t consider it safe to travel at this time. At the end of the day, I need to come back home, either to my old parents in Bangalore or my elderly in-laws in Calcutta. I don’t want to be a threat to them. It’s best to stay at home till things are a bit under control.

Alternative career options
Right now it’s not on my mind and anyway, I am a telecommunications engineer, so my brain never sits idle. I am helping my husband with research about his projects.

Keeping busy
When I am really bored, there is Netflix. I knew zero about cooking. Now, I have gathered a little bit of knowledge about that!",culture
"A cosy list of monsoon reads to curl up with in this weather, writes Ananya Bhatia"," The monsoon winds have been blowing all over the country the past few week. But now, the monsoon is truly upon us. News has started pouring in of the havoc the rain has been causing all across. Whether you are someone who enjoys dancing in the rain or absolutely detests it, for the next few months they are going to be another reason why we’ll be spending more time indoors. So when it’s dripping outside or when you’ve run out of ideas on what more can you possibly do at home, why not dip your toes into some seasonal reading?
Rains are an integral part of life in our country so it isn’t surprising at all that they play a huge role in our stories as well. We have some especially curated monsoon reads for you that will transport you to faraway lands while it roars and thunders outside. So pull out the books from your real or digital shelves, flip the pages and let us start a reading storm!
The first book on our monsoon reading list is It Rained All Night by Buddhadeva Bose which was first published in Bengali as Raat Bhorey Brishti. Banned by the then government in Bengal on charges of obscenity, It Rained All Night is a triangular love story in which the rain plays a catalyst. The book soon became a bestseller because of its bold and unapologetic depiction of desire and adultery. The story revolves around the lives of Malati, an attractive middle-class Bengali girl, and her bookish lecturer husband Nayonangshu. After her marriage, Malati finds her husband to be insecure, sexually timid and unable to satisfy her. She discovers passion in the arms of the confident, earthy journalist Jayanto whose love provides her solace from the demands of her wifely duties. Narrated in turns by the wife and the husband, the book makes for a pacy read as it captures the conflict between the couple in a matter-of-fact, unsentimental way. The complexities of human emotions come alive in Clinton B. Seely’s superb translation. If you’re looking for a book that can help you understand what makes or breaks a marriage, this one is for you.
Our second recommendation is Where the Rain Is Born, a collection of poems, short stories and excerpts about Kerala, edited by Anita Nair. The monsoon showers that bring alive ‘God’s Own Country’ form the backdrop for each piece in the anthology. The book includes works written in English as well as those translated from Malayalam. For the uninitiated, it is a great first step into the world of Malayalam literature with pieces by renowned authors such as Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, M.T. Vasudevan Nair and Lalithambika Antharjanam as part of the selection. The wonderful thing about this book is that you can pick it up when it is gloomy outside and undertake a literary journey into the lush landscape of Kerala even though you are stuck at home.
Amitav Ghosh’s The Hungry Tide is the next title on our list, a rich and exotic saga set in the Sundarbans and the archipelago of islands surrounding Calcutta in the Bay of Bengal. Only the truly dispossessed and brave-hearted venture into this world where storms, rain and devouring tides are a part of everyday living and man-eating tigers and crocodiles rule the precarious waters. The arrival of the stubborn American-born Piyali Roy and business-minded Kannai Dutt disturb the shaky balance and set in motion cataclysmic events. A story of love and revolution, and of man’s place in nature, do not miss this one if you like your tales with a historical twist. In fact, if you are feeling adventurous (and smitten by Ghosh’s prose) dive right into the Ibis trilogy: Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke and Flood of Fire. Though not literally focused on the rains, the vast array of characters and storm-tossed adventure tale is sure to provide a distraction if you are suffering due to the gloomy weather (or life) conditions.
The next one on our list is a seminal play by the iconic Mohan Rakesh, Ashadh Ka Ek Din translated into English as One Day in the Season of Rain by Vinay and Aparna Dharwadker. The play received great critical acclaim when it first came out in 1958 and many critics celebrated it as the first modern play in Hindi. The play revolves around the gifted but yet unknown classical Sanskrit poet-playwright Kalidas, torn between his lover and muse, Mallika, and his own ambitions. If he wants his talents to find recognition, he must leave behind his village and set out for the royal palace. Once he has made his choice and found his share of fame, he spurns the woman who believed in him. Much like the separated lovers in his own poem Meghadutam (another wonderful read this season, quite literally the tale of a cloud that acts as a messenger!), he must suffer and grieve for his beloved forever. In fact, Rakesh later revealed that it was his reading of Meghadutam that inspired him to write Ashadh Ka Ek Din.

Artistes are making innovative music videos during the pandemic," Weyes Blood — Wild Time
This one feels like a blast from the past, straight out of the climax of the 1969 road film Easy Rider, which was directed by Dennis Hopper. The camerawork is intentionally shaky while the colours bleed into one another giving out a psychedelic vibe. Bursts of bright colours appear throughout the video and Natalie Mering aka Weyes Blood can be seen playing the guitar in a forest beside a brook where a man lies motionless  mysteriously. Soon she is joined by her friends and they make a splash in the water — once again a throwback to the Woodstock era. Neon body paint, which glows in the dark, is brought out soon but the playful mood gives way to something more ominous as a swirl of images mirror the rising crescendo of the song with lyrics that go: “Lost and tangled up in you/ Everyone knows/ You just did what you had to/ Burning much more than ever before/ Burning down the door/ It’s a wild time.”
Tinashe — Rascal (Superstar)
It’s a pink wonderland for Tinashe as she wakes up in bed wearing a leopard-print lingerie in a pink-themed room. As she checks herself out in the mirror and gets ready, a drone hovers around her capturing her every move while she sings, “Money, cash, clothes, fast cars/Fast lane, dash playin’ with the Nascars/ I’m in the Valley chillin’ with the bad bro”. Soon the location shifts to what looks like an empty lounge area with comfy couches bathed in red-pink light. This time Tinashe — all alone once again — grinds on the floor, seducing the camera.  

Cardi B — WAP feat. Megan Thee Stallion
Cardi B and Megan turn on the heat and spice things up in the video for WAP. Keeping the team to a bare minimum, the video instead has tigers roaming around while they dance up a storm in a mansion. When they lie around in a room snakes give them company, slithering around them. In other scenes a team of dancers perform their moves maintaining distance. Every room in the the mansion leads to a new possibility. In fact, Kylie Jenner puts in an appearance. Butt statues and an indoor pool add to the glam look of the multicoloured mansion. Meanwhile, Cardi raps it up in a leopard-printed room with an actual leopard in it!

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Haim — Don’t Wanna
The Haim sisters are famous for taking those legendary walks in their music videos. And in the video for Don’t Wanna (from their new album Women in Music Pt. III) they are back in their elements, walking down deserted streets, a shout-out to their own video for I Want You Back made three years ago! Of course, they do things differently in Don’t Wanna and make it a fun watch this time. They treat the walk like a competition as each try to outdo the other. They move ahead of the other and pick up speed, going from ambling to jogging to running! They employ tricks as well like one sister feigns tiredness so that the other two can come back to check on her, giving her ample time to sprint away! As they get into the competitive spirit, one of the sisters finally gets into a car and drives to the (supposed) finishing line to emerge as the winner!      

Phoebe Bridgers — I Know the End
Here’s a video whose plot twists unfold like a thriller. The first image from I Know The End grabs attention with just Phoebe’s head bobbing over a tub of water placed in a hallway closed off by white walls in a long shot. As the camera closes in on her, she sings, “Somewhere in Germany but I can’t place it...  Close my eyes, fantasise.” Soon she gets up, fully dressed in a skeleton outfit. As she waits in a changing room, an attendant wearing a white costume gets hold of an apple and rolls it on the floor, whose movement is stopped by Phoebe with her boot. She picks it up and bites into it. She moves out of the building and gets into a car. The drum beats pick up pace, and as she sings, “I turned around, there was nothing there/ Yeah, I guess the end is here”, a beam of light falls on her. She shields her face with her hand and starts running away with a guy on hot pursuit. Scenes are intercut with her in the tub but this time she is splashing around in agony. She runs straight into a stadium and joins her band who are performing the song for a handful of people! Oh, there’s one more twist to the story but we are not revealing it here!

The White Buffalo — Problem Solution
“Well, they say follow your heart/ But it’s confused about everything”. The lines set the tone for the music video which sees a long-haired, bearded Jake Smith aka The White Buffalo acting out the conflicting emotions contained in the song. The camera captures Jake in mid-shots and close-ups as he fights his inner demons, all alone in a room and in a car. Often he is framed in silhouette.
He is constantly in the process of wearing or taking off a black jacket which reveals a colourful shirt underneath, a comment on the character’s condition. The grim song which almost plunges into despair finally changes tone and shifts gears with the lyrics — “Well, it’s a new day/One more chance to step in the light/ Sun is out/ Feel what it’s all about/ Well, they come and go”. Jake smiles, laughs, and does a jig. He even bows in the end with a message in the lyric — “Let’s just get through the day”! Bring Me The Horizon — Parasite Eve
“I’ve got a fever, don’t breathe on me/ I’m a believer of nobody/ Won’t let me leave ’cause I’ve seen something/ Hope I don’t sneeze, I don’t/ Really we just need to fear something/ Only pretending to feel something/ I know you’re dying to run/ I wanna turn you around”. Parasite Eve is a song that documents the pandemic. The video is inspired by lead singer Oli Sykes’s fave comic book characters and anime like Tokyo Ghoul, Venom, the game Hellblade and a film called The Inferno Unseen. Concept sketches for each member were created and the shoot was done with a limited crew.
The splashes of colour and lighting give the video a haunting quality, which captures the paranoia and anxiety of our times.

Another Sky — Fell In Love With The City
This video scores with concert footage and tour visual diaries. But unlike lockdown videos, this one also has new shots of singer Catrin Vincent gazing into the distance and then staring into the camera. Themes of isolation and despair emerge from the flurry of disparate images that are put together. A sign reads, “Who will survive in America?”. Soon another sign reads, “Hamburgers” and the next one — “Bar”. The lyrics, “Fell in love with the city/ As I fell out of love with you”, underscore the irony of it all.

Kelly Lee Owens — On
This one plays out like a short road-trip film. It begins by showing a golden retriever sitting inside a car. A man walks up, gets into the vehicle, and they take off, rolling along the countryside. The man and the dog get out and play catch in a field, which we get to see from inside the car through the window. The camera stays inside the car. The video unravels like a mood piece, building on atmosphere with shots of skies, green fields, drops of rain on glass, the sunshine on an open highway. The dog’s ears perk up once they reach a ferry landing.... the camera finally moves out and follows the man as he walks inside the area, revealing a tragic moment, which gives the video a melancholic quality.

Jaden — Cabin Fever
Jaden hits the road with a friend in this video, singing about palm trees and kaleidoscope dreams as he breezes down in a cool, multicoloured car. The girl he is pining for looks out from her window wearing a mask but doesn’t step outside. He comes to her window with a placard reading, ‘What about today?” to which she replies with a “Sorry”! “I’m at home thinking ’bout you and me... Girl, I really wanna believe ya/ If you love me, how come I never see ya?” he sings. The last image — of a crestfallen Jaden wearing a mask and sitting in a room with a guitar resting against the wall — will make you go aww.

Deep Purple — Man Alive
“Come on let’s go Space Truckin’” — Deep Purple had fired our imagination with these words in the song Space Truckin’. The legendary band are back with a new album, Whoosh!, and treading familiar territory in the video for the song Man Alive with its space theme. Talking about the album, frontman Ian Gillan had said, “It’s about the transient nature of humanity on earth”, and the video starts off with an astronaut on survey mode. We get to see bird’s-eye views of the earth in distress as Ian sings, “All creatures great and small/Graze on blood-red soil”.  ",culture
Abhishek Dutta unveils his new resort wear line with an underwater shoot," From tribal-print bikini to chanderi cold-shoulder crop top, designer Abhishek Dutta experimented with his resort wear line and came up with five looks for Subhamita Banerjee and Solveig O for an underwater shoot at the Swissotel swimming pool. Abhishek decodes the shoot experience as well as the collection for The Telegraph.
The shoot: The surreal and the calmness under water always excited me. Though it was quite challenging at first, but as we started off, the shoot turned out to be a most memorable one. This has been on my bucket list for a long time. Getting the right pool was also important, also the right people and the right attire. All the three things had to fall in place. Till I saw the pictures, I did not know how the shoot will come out. It was trial and error for me. People have seen different shoots but this is something new and it will set a benchmark altogether.
The outfits: I keep on doing resort wear; it is a signature line of mine. This time I have experimented with it. We are calling this collection the Tribal Junkie. The outfits had a lot of tribal prints. Underwater has this fantasy feel and we wanted to do something out of the box. The swimwear and some of the resort wear had a lot of detailing, which is visible. There is a lot of hand-embroidered, metallic sheen, and sequin work. The looks are modern yet have a tribal touch to them. I have used all natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and georgette. The outfits are comfortable and not very fitted. Only the swimwear are body hugging. I have used chanderi as ruffles. This is a fun collection. Whether it is underwater or a day look or resort look, anybody and everybody can wear it. You just need to layer it up differently.
Challenges: The basic challenge was getting the perfect shot. It’s not very easy to pose under water, especially because the water was really cold. It takes time to get comfortable inside the water. It took a little longer than usual to shoot this. In a normal shoot you can see the pictures immediately but here you need to wait. That is also a challenge in an underwater shoot.

‘I do not sing to entertain people. I sing views’," I am a cultural politician, says Sambhaji Bhagat. At the time of this interview, the Dalit activist and Marathi folk singer is in Calcutta for the Seagull Peaceworks. He continues, “I don’t mean to say I am ignoring politics, but I am not a hardcore politician. Through my work, I want to spread the message of peace and prosperity among people. My medium is culture, my work, my writings.”
The theme of the Peaceworks conference is “The Idea of the Indian Constitution”. Bhagat looks relaxed despite a hectic morning. He tells me he feels buoyed by the audience response. “These are informed people. They know the subject and hence the interaction is quite lively,” he says as we settle down in a largish conference hall in south Calcutta’s Tollygunge Club.
This is Bhagat’s second visit to the city. The first time was in 1986-87, when he was still a student. The city has changed immensely, he remarks. The conversation turns naturally to the general state of affairs and Bhagat says, “The way the face of the country is changing every day, it is quite alarming.” He continues, “We call ourselves a democratic country, yet the way things are now, we are slowly moving towards a society that is grossly infested with fundamentalist ideas and fascism. It is quite sad.” His shoulder-length locks sway as he shakes his head from side to side and makes his point in an even, raspy voice.
Bhagat is 60 years old. In his teenage days, he became a member of a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh shakha, but quit after two years.
He says, “It was 1975. I had been arrested during the Emergency and put behind bars. I was in Class X then. I was released only because I was a minor.”

After his Class XII exams, he moved to Bombay [now Mumbai] from Pune and eventually joined Ambedkar College. He talks about how it was the centre of the Dalit movement. “The Dalit Panther Movement was phasing out, but I found books, thousands of them, paintings on the walls of hostel rooms, poems. I read and absorbed. I read Marx. I spent six hours reading every day. The more I read, the more I realised that I was on the wrong side. I was supporting the wrong people. I quit the shakha,” says Bhagat unabashedly.
“I cannot change my past and I do not deny it either. I believe the best thing a person can do is to learn from his or her mistakes.” He proffers with a smile.
Bhagat was born in a village named Mahu in Maharashtra’s Satara district. His mother used to work as a daily labourer in the fields and his father was a cobbler. “I am the first graduate not only from my family, but also from my village,” he says.
As Bhagat tells it, his mother did not encourage him to study. Instead, she was rather pleased when he found early employment — as a waiter at a hotel in Panchgani. Says Bhagat, “But my seth [the hotel owner], a Muslim, made me join school. He was a very nice man.” At college, he found yet another benefactor in his principal. There was no stopping Bhagat after this — neither academically nor as an activist.
He says, “I chose to be a cultural politician because it is through culture, and culture alone, that people have tried to harm us.” He talks about the “cohesive force” at play during the independence  movement and immediately after it. A force that brought people together. “Jaati, dharm ko baaju mein rakh ke, Bharat ka achchhe nagarik banke rahenge... Keeping aside caste, creed and religion, we will come together as good citizens. But now there is a force trying to destroy everything,” he says.
I have heard his song Inki Soorat Ko Pehchaano. It goes: Hitler ke saathi, janaazon ke baaraati/Poochhte nahin insaan ko kaun hai tu/Poochhte hain, dharam aur jaati... Inko dhyaan se dekho re bhai...” I quote the lines back to him and ask nothing. Bhagat smiles a melancholy smile and says, “I am aggrieved at the game that has been played against the people of India. Our culture, our history, all of it has been interpreted wrongly and used against us.”
He does not say it in so many words, but it is not difficult to understand what he is out to do — he is trying to use his music and his compositions to spread the message of harmony.
Bhagat says in hushed tones, “People have used our culture as a slow poison to break the fabric of our society.” The first assault on that fabric, according to him, was when the concept of upper caste and lower caste was created and used to divide us. He adds, “Now, the second level of politics is at play. They use terms such as deshbhakti and raashtravaad. This will have to stop... The makers of our Constitution have created a constitutional value system to keep these things at bay. We have to stop people from misinterpreting our cultural and social set-up; our constitutional value system.”
From speaking impassionedly without pause, he suddenly alters pace. This time, he speaks slowly, measuring each and every word, “It is a very, very slow process. There is no shortcut to it. Hum prajaasattaa ke bal par ek culture khadaa karnaa chaahte hain... nahi hai, par hum khadaa karnaa chaahte hain... Based on our democratic principles, we would like to create a culture of unity... it is not there at present, such a culture, but we would like to create one.”
Bhagat is a balladeer who travels to the nooks and corners of India to convey his message. He believes in connecting with people. But now, when the digital medium is catching up, does he find his style cramped? He leans back in his chair, folds his hand and replies, “We use whatever medium is accessible. After all, there are mobile phones in the hands of the lower middle classes and working classes. The immediate emotional response, however, is to be found only in a concert.”
I have seen videos of Bhagat’s performances where he does not stop at singing. He also engages at length with his audience on social and political issues. He now tells me, “I am not an entertainer. I do not sing to entertain people. Main vichaar gaata hoon... I sing views.”
Head bowed, he looks at the ground intently, as if trying to arrange his words and then starts to talk again. “I am not talking of any one political party,” he says. “Not the BJP, not the Congress but it is the general trend of politics that is worrying. It is a slow poison. It is not like that of Hitler where he would torture people in a gas chamber. This is psychological warfare. They will kill us from within.” The situation is quite grim, he hammers home, “They will poison your mind, your heart, they will ask your name, if you are a Hindu or a Muslim, a Bengali or a Maharashtrian. They will divide people.”
He seems to think that in the process what will happen is when Hindus are pacified, Muslims will come together, when upper caste people are encouraged, Dalits will get consolidated. “They will kill all ideologies, kill our history. That is the post-modernist understanding,” he says wringing his fingers. And it’s a wrap. 1959: Bhagat is born in Satara, Maharashtra

"Madam, Adam, and sin unoriginal"," I decided not to tell my parents about the coffee date, nor my friends. It’s just coffee, I kept telling myself as I added a dash of lipstick. My pulse raced and I realised how unprepared I was to step out, cross the road and walk to the nearest café in the locality. That’s what Covid-19 and the three months of staying cooped up at home has done to me.
I was still not sure if it was safe to grab a cuppa with my husband, even when “unlocked”. Of course, I was in my armour — mask — and wielding sanitiser. But the what-ifs kept cropping up in my mind. It’s just coffee, I told myself again and again.
It was a mere 300-metre walk from my house to the café in south Calcutta’s Hindustan Park area. Twice I wanted to turn back, especially when it started to drizzle. Going out for pleasure in the rain feels like double sin post-Covid.
As I reached the large portico of the café, a man rushed at me even before I could shut my umbrella. He was equally anxious to check my temperature and save the world. More jitters! What if all the brisk walking had meddled with the body temperature? What if I was asked to stand apart?
But I was cleared and asked to step in, sanitiser in hand. I started to relax. The bustling place where I would often take my friends and pose for countless selfies had mellowed in these few months. Fewer tables, masked waiters and disposable crockery gave it a different feel. Even the old menu had made way for a makeshift one. I looked around for the regular faces. There was none. The few tables that were occupied were spaced out. I recognised a waiter who would often serve us. He waved his gloved hand from a distance. I am sure there was a smile behind the mask.

I remember spending hours here, but today I preferred to hurry my order. Two mochas, no food and make it quick, we told the waiter. We were in no hurry but too uncomfortable to hang out late. We felt we were wronging the world in some way.
And then came the moment of crisis.
As the steaming coffees came in takeaway cups, I was not sure what my next move should be. Should I remove my mask and keep it on the table? Should I hang it from some place? Should I remove it at all or just slide it down my face a little? Eventually, I gulped my coffee, mask in hand and sanitiser on table.
It was the quickest coffee date of my life and I was glad when it was over. Both my date and I were more taken up with sanitising our hands, seats, bags and phones, rather than making conversation. We walked back relieved, happy to escape from the scene of crime and determined never to cross the line again.
No photographs were taken, no eulogies written on Facebook and all evidence of the evening removed.
But we crossed the line again, the very next week. To be honest, this time it was an unplanned sin. We had been running errands near Ballygunge Place when a popular Bengali eatery caught our eye. Going for a meal to this restaurant usually entailed a wait. I would see serpentine queues outside its gates during festivals. But now it stood almost deserted. The temptation was too much to resist. The partner in crime and I made a beeline for the empty gates, emboldened by our first dereliction.
Again the mandatory checks. Temperatures recorded, hands sanitised and, this time, even our shoes were wrapped in blue plastic before we were let in. Empty rooms greeted us as we stood in our funny blue footwear. The tables had been reduced to half, the buffet discontinued and there was no other guest in sight. It seemed as if the whole place was waiting for us — a flattering yet daunting feeling.
The waiters admitted they were getting used to packing takeaways rather than serving guests. That Friday, we were their first customers at 1.30pm. Again, a quick meal on disposable plates and glasses, which we helped the cleaners dispose of.
We don’t touch the plates once we serve the food, said a waiter. The guests have to serve themselves and another batch of staff cleans up later. It felt odd to remove disposable plates from plastic covers, wipe them with tissues and serve each other daal and aloo bhaja with wooden spoons. The sauce with the fish fry came in a small plastic container. Only two tables stood in that room offering guests a lot of space if they did plan to drop in. We ate in peace with no hovering waiter, clanking crockery or noisy chatter disturbing us. Yet, after a point, we missed that free-flowing cheerfulness. The meal was good, but as we walked out I felt hungry for the not-so-sanitised old normal.",culture
The Tuscan escape," He’s the charming grandson of the famous shoemaker to Hollywood stars and shares his grandfather’s name. Salvatore Ferragamo. With his father, Ferruccio, he has restored and refurbished a medieval Tuscan country estate, Il Borro, in exquisite Ferragamo style. Extracts from a chat with Ferragamo...

How is everything in Italy? How are you all coping with Covid?
We are all well fortunately. The situation has been very challenging — the three-month lockdown period in Italy has been very tough and long. We have had some positive results as well as today Covid-19 in Italy is on the decline — that is reassuring. The serious and critically ill patients have been down, so these are very good numbers.

Since Salvatore Ferragamo is an iconic fashion brand, many people in India naturally think that you are Salvatore Ferragamo, the famous shoe designer? So tell us what you do in this amazing Relais & Chateau property, Il Borro!
I am the third generation and by Italian tradition, the oldest son carries the grandfather’s name. I carry my grandfather’s name — Salvatore Ferragamo, so I am SF Junior in a way and I have this incredible privilege and responsibility to do well in everything that I do. However, I have taken a completely different path. It’s a long story but basically in order to join the fashion side, you have to have some pre-requirements — a university degree, an MBA, work experience and then you work for management who reports to the board and so on. I had all those pre-requirements but I also have an identical twin brother, James, who was really interested in the family business of fashion. He is now in charge and manages that part of the business... and I have been involved with this beautiful project of Il Borro and the incredible transformation of the estate into something truly unique.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Can you tell us a little bit about Il Borro?
It is sometimes difficult to describe Il Borro. It is an incredibly authentic experience — you can stay in a medieval village which has been completely restored and perfectly renovated and transformed into a five-star Relais & Chateaux hotel, so guests can come to Tuscany, stay at Il Borro in the medieval hamlet and have a truly unique cultural, historic and architectural experience with all the modern comforts that they are accustomed to, which is very important. 

You have a fantastic restaurant....
Yes, we actually have two restaurants on the property — one is a casual one and the other a gourmet restaurant. What is important is that all the produce which is farmed on the estate is actually available for our guests in the restaurants — so on the property we produce wine, extra virgin olive oil, wonderful honey from our local bees, chicken, eggs and beef. From this year, we will be producing our own flour from ancient wheat, so bread, pasta and pastry too will be made here. We are also planning on getting sheep soon and they will be producing pecorino and ricotta cheese, so it’s truly a unique experience for the guests. Our wonderful chef — Andrea Campani — has been with us for many years and is excellent in traditional Tuscan cuisine.
We also have a pizzeria. From this year, our pizzas will be produced with our own wheat, which has a very low content of glucose and is easy to digest. Ingredients from our own garden are used and the mozzarella comes from a local producer in Tuscany.

A few years ago you had mentioned that the estate is completely sustainable. Is that still correct?
We are certified organic in all our farming practices. For the hotel we produce our own solar energy so we actually qualify as a negative carbon footprint property because we produce three times the energy that we consume. And do you think that this will become more and more important now as the whole world has been hit with Covid-19? The expression “responsible luxury” is a little cliched but in your case it’s not a cliche at all — it’s reality! Are you getting more enquiries now for the next season because you really provide responsible luxury?
Yes, absolutely! We had put our solar fields back in 2010 and for the past five years have started organic farming. But after Covid, we have realised that in Italy, due to the lockdown, the quality of the air in a town like Florence, which is in the valley, is subject to pollution because of the traffic and so on, but we have had some incredibly blue skies, clear air and everybody just appreciated that with many comments on social media about Florence and how amazing that was. I think that today this is something that is very present in all our minds and this can be done — we can be socially responsible and Il Borro is an example of that!

Is the hotel open now?
Yes, we opened on July 1. As you can imagine, we have very low occupancy. International travellers are having a very difficult time to get to us so for the moment we are working much more with the local market.

Can you tell us the history of Il Borro. When I met your father Ferruccio, he said it took 10 years of renovation. What do you think made him take on this enormous task of converting a medieval village and turning it into a Relais & Chateaux property?
It’s a story that goes back to 1993. We would actually come to the property and rent it from the previous owner and it was just a place for the family to gather on the weekends. Then we had the opportunity of buying this beautiful property and transforming it into something really special. I thought it was an incredible concept and we could share the beauty of this place with the world — the medieval village, the villa, the property, the farming, the wines and so on, to make it sustainable and that is why we did it — it was also a diversification of my father’s investments but at the same time with a clear vision.
How many rooms do you have at Il Borro? You also have a property called Viesca, right?
Yes we do. Viesca is a beautiful property which is actually my grandmother’s home. She unfortunately passed away two years ago. It is just 20 minutes away from Florence and 20 minutes from Il Borro. Everyone has their own villas here — in these Covid times it is perfect as social distancing is natural! Tell us a little bit about your wines? Your wines are available in India, right?
Yes our wines are available in India. We produce white wines — a wonderful Chardonnay and many different red wines. Tuscany is particularly well-known for its reds so we have the flagship wines — Il Borro which is a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah grapes with 18 months in oak. It is full-bodied and the 2016 vintage got a fantastic 96 points from Robert Parker. We are really doing well with those wines.

Under what name should the people in India look out for your wines — is it the Il Borro label?
Well we have the Il Borro Toscana which is a full-bodied wine. We have another wine called Pian di Nova which is a Syrah and Sangiovese and another 100 per cent Chardonnay — these are the main wines we have in the Indian market. We also have a Rose which is beautiful.

Do you have the beautiful bubbly in the Indian market or do we have to come to Il Borro for that?!
I’m glad you remember that — Bolle di Borro. We have a few bottles in India. We actually only produce 5,000 bottles for the whole world, so it’s highly allocated and very limited number of bottles that we sell of those wines. It’s a wonderful concept... Rose Methode Champenoise-style from 100 per cent Sangiovese grapes and is really unique. We also have other wines like the Alessandro which is our Syrah.

You have been to India before, so tell us a little bit about your impressions of India?
Yes, I have been to India several times and one of my most memorable experiences is an Indian wedding I attended of a close friend of my sisters that lasted three weeks. The wedding started in Delhi and ended in Chennai. Indian people really know how to party and I had a fantastic time. It was a great experience and I saw a lot of India at that time. Apart from the wedding, the other things I remember are visiting the Taj Mahal. It was very impressive. Also the Lake Palace, the Windy Palace (Hawa Mahal), the incredible craftsmanship, the artisans, the workmanship and the beautiful architecture and buildings were truly incredible.

Tell us a little bit about the artisans in Il Borro village?
We have a shoemaker, a beautiful jewellery store where you can actually take classes on how to make custom jewellery, then there is a lady who produces her own fabrics which are spectacular, a ceramics shop and a person who does furniture restoration.

Would you recommend Il Borro for an Indian wedding?
Yes, I would. In fact, we have had a couple of Indian weddings here. I think Indians and Italians are very similar — we love family, particularly large family gatherings, good food, good wines, good parties, so I think Il Borro is ideal for the Indian market.

How many people can stay at Il Borro? How big a wedding can you have?
We can have about 200 guests maximum staying on the property and we have facilities that can accommodate more than that — about 350 guests. But as I mentioned, we have Viesca which is 20 minutes away and that accommodates around 100 guests. So you can actually have a wedding/party right in the middle of the medieval village?
Yes, I actually got married in the medieval village almost 20 years ago — it’s an incredibly romantic experience. There’s this beautiful little chapel in the village, where you can have the ceremony where you walk over this very narrow and tall stone bridge which is the only means of access through the medieval village, then up through the winery and then through the villa and from there to the reception. The dining experience can be held in one of our Italian gardens. Then we have another area dedicated for parties which is very special. It is a very beautiful place for weddings, but we try to limit our weddings so our main hotel activities continue. We never mix the clients of the hotel with the property for weddings. You have to book the whole property for a wedding as it’s not fair to the other guests to close off part of the property when there is a wedding.

Do you own the whole estate? How big is it?
Yes we do. The estate is about 3,000 acres (1,100 hectares). How do you rate the hotel experiences and service in India?
I remember staying at the Oberoi hotel in Agra and that was a really wonderful experience. I think something that India does really well... better than Italy... is the staff and service — both were impeccable.

What are the prerequisites to be part of the Relais & Chateaux?
Relais & Chateaux is an association of around 520 hotels and restaurants around the world. They have to be privately owned and not belonging to large corporations. The most important aspect is that every property is unique to every owner. Every property has a different jewel so to speak. At Il Borro we have the beautiful jewel of the medieval village. If you go to Venezuela, there’s a property there where the owner has a beautiful collection of butterflies, so the beauty of Relais & Chateaux is that every property has something special about it.

Stitching a sustainable saga," For Anita Dongre, perhaps the “designer” prefix is only a brick in the wall of a larger design that she is the architect of — turning her company with a reported annual turnover of over $100 million (about Rs 750 crore) into a carbon-neutral enterprise and uplifting communities from the hinterland by empowering women.
With multiple labels catering to the entire gamut of sartorial demand, the House of Anita Dongre is what it is today due to Dongre’s expertise in design, acumen in business and a sagacious tenacity to work towards a sustainable future.
And she has firmly put her money where her mouth is, be it in the form of her HQ that saw the conversion of 100,000sqft of barren land into a sprawling eco-conscious unit in the hills of Rabale in Navi Mumbai, her “heart-crafted” brand Grassroot that strives to be sustainable from the points of view of who makes the clothes and how they are being made, or even taking steps to make her older pret labels sustainable through the use of conscious fabric and packaging. She has a store in New York and recently held her first virtual trunk show over the American independence day weekend. “Professionally, I see my company being carbon-neutral in five years. Caring for your people and the planet have far-reaching benefits to both profit margins and your conscience, so the challenge is to keep at it and continue inspiring yourself and others to make the effort,” she tells The Telegraph. Excerpts from the interview.

You are the only Indian designer to join the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. How did your love affair with sustainability begin?
We were raised in a culture that was already extremely sustainable and we were taught never to waste resources and I truly believe that it was this upbringing that reflected and still reflects in my personal belief, day-to-day living, design philosophy and work. In that sense, sustainability is a way of life and not a short-lived, or sudden love affair. I think this is true for most Indians who were raised to conserve, reuse, upcycle and never waste.

To someone who is as invested in sustainability as you are, what does “sustainability in fashion” mean?
Sustainability for me is simply a way of life that also affects your sartorial choices. My idea of sustainability is not very different from what Indian traditions have always reinforced. The Indian sub-continent has amongst the oldest living cultural traditions. Handed down over generations, these cultural traditions held at the very heart of them a celebration of nature.
In fashion, we look at traditional artisans to guide us back into a way of creating art that is respectful to the earth and wastes nothing. While I can’t speak for others, sustainability is a thought process and a way of life that recognises the impact of our every action on the planet. It’s an approach that has guided my every decision for as long as I can remember. Setting up an office space that harnesses nature’s strengths for cooling and lighting, building a compost pit, a biogas plant, recycling water; and, in our product, the choice to work with artisans, to be inspired to tell stories about nature and indigenous practices, and choosing packaging that’s earth-friendly — I could go on but essentially, sustainability is a way of life and doesn’t work if compartmentalised.

How did you conceive your “heart-crafted” brand, Grassroot?
Grassroot is a 30-year-old dream. What made it happen was meeting the women of SEWA (Self Employed Women’s Association) and realising how important this work would be for the villages of India. There is a desperate need to bring steady, sustainable employment back to our heartlands. Through building Grassroot, we have taken the first few steps towards that future while also shining a spotlight on India’s rich textile traditions. Through Grassroot and the Anita Dongre Foundation, I have had the privilege of meeting and working with many inspiring women. We work with artisan clusters to take employment back to the villages of India. Multiple studies have shown that a whole community benefits when a woman makes financial decisions and from working with these women’s groups, I find that this is entirely true.
Women will drive the economy of this country on the strength of their dedication to lifting communities out of poverty. When unskilled, they’re willing to work hard to learn a skill that will empower them financially to make better decisions as a family. In Maharashtra, we have trained hundreds of women across five centres to gain skills and be employed in their villages. With skilled artisan clusters, we make sure to send work to villages to the same end. The result is beautiful craftsmanship in design and entire communities being lifted out of poverty.
All the behind-the-scenes stories are of strong women who are lifting their families out of the circle of poverty and how this ability to bring an income to the household and community have given them a voice at the table. Ensuring dependable and accessible income is the first step towards empowering our highly capable women in rural India.

What are the challenges of turning the House of Anita Dongre with a reported annual turnover of over $100 million into a carbon-neutral enterprise with multiple sustainable ventures?
The most common challenge in building a sustainable business is convincing people that sustainability is good for the bottom line. In the last few years across all our brands, we’ve started working with sustainable fabric and biodegradable packaging material, both of which felt impossible when we first started discussing it.
Caring for your people and the planet has far-reaching benefits to both profit margins and your conscience, so the challenge is to keep at it and continue inspiring yourself and others to make the effort. With AND and Global Desi, little things make a big impact like having energy-efficient lighting in the stores and working with non-profits to make accessories from fabric. There’s so much more to do but such exciting early steps. From AND to Anita Dongre, and Western designs in all sizes to gota-patti and bridal lehngas with pockets — how do you define your relationship with Indian craft and the modern Indian woman?
My earliest memories are of visiting Rajasthan over summer vacations to meet my grandparents. While there, I would wander into the markets and spend hours designing bangles and fabric patterns with artisans. On the other hand, I’m an avid people-watcher and spend hours talking to young women who are rewriting corporate India. My design philosophy is a bridge between these two worlds.
My muse is the modern Indian woman who is still rooted in tradition and my partners are Indian artisans who bring my vision alive with their rich artistry. I have always strived to create beautiful designs that are relevant for the modern woman while also keeping craftsmanship relevant in the 21st century. My approach to design is utilitarian, conscious of aesthetics and sensitive to the earth.

Your design HQ in Navi Mumbai is an eco-conscious building. Tell us about some of its features.
Our office space in the hills of Rabale is very special to me. The 100,000sqft property has been transformed from a barren piece of land, nestled between the lush green hills of Rabale. We used the luxury of space to build an ergonomically-designed office that functions on the principle of ‘reduce, reuse and recycle’. The walls are designed with air gaps and insulation to optimise energy efficiency and for the hottest days, we have air-conditioners that don’t go below 24° Celsius. To reduce the environmental impact, our waste is segregated and goes into a compost pit that produces biogas for our kitchens that serve only vegetarian food. We recycle water and have every tap fitted with a device that reduces water consumption. There’s a terrace garden, flowerbeds across every walkway and balcony, further improving the air and temperature of the space.

What are some of the biggest hurdles that you have faced in your quest for complete sustainability?
Bringing about carbon-neutrality is a slow process and requires focus. One of those big-picture contributors is keeping family units together in villages by making livelihood accessible. At Anita Dongre Foundation, we have trained 200 formerly unskilled women in rural Maharashtra and ensured employment in these villages. Today, Anita Dongre Foundation runs and advocates for these village production units in six villages and we have its sights set on expanding this impact.
As designers, we must take the responsibility to educate our shoppers and garner support for handmade products — the silver lining of this pandemic has been shoppers weighing their impact on the planet with every purchase decision.

You are also one of the few Indian design houses that have attracted foreign investment and your retail network has almost 1,000 stores. How do you ensure that there is no diffusion of your design DNA and ethos amidst all this?
I started this business with my sister Meena and, shortly afterwards, my brother Mukesh joined us in bringing my vision to life. In recent years Yash, my son, has joined us too. With my family, we share a sense of purpose for this business and a varied set of experiences that have made House of Anita Dongre what it is. It was my vision from very early on when I started the business to professionalise the organisation and my goal was that the brands and businesses had to outlive the founders, including myself. With this in mind and to expand the business, we needed both capital and expertise, which could come from a right partner and, in our case, it was General Atlantic (GA). The team at GA brings in their professional experience while believing in my vision and trusting the core of what we have built.

How has the pandemic affected your plans of making women-driven craft clusters sustainable?
The pandemic has been a bigger reminder of why it is important to continue doing what we have been doing this whole time — creating opportunity for women, especially in rural India. Our plans have been delayed in terms of execution, but we have used it to plan a model that ensures the greatest benefit. Post the pandemic also, we will continue to grow these initiatives and take work back to the villages. We do, however, need the media and shoppers to believe in this vision and support us in making it real.

What are your immediate plans for the House of Anita Dongre?
Professionally, I see my company being carbon-neutral in five years. We have a team that is constantly working on finding more sustainable alternatives to our processes and materials, and we want to encourage more people in the industry to walk this path. The hope is that more and more people understand the importance of the impact their actions cause to the planet and join us in this movement to make the world a better place.",culture
"Andrew Ford, the first Australian consul general in town, says goodbye"," Andrew Ford, who set up the Austrlian consulate general in Calcutta in April 2019, went back home on July 2. The consul general who, with his wife Christine, was a popular presence in the city’s social and cultural circuit, responded to questions from The Telegraph over email from Canberra.

Why did you leave?
Christine and I had to finish our posting in Calcutta and return to Australia in July for personal and family reasons. I spent 15 months in Calcutta rather than the three years I had planned but in that time managed to establish Australia’s new consulate general in Calcutta and build many good friendships.

Did you have to serve a quarantine period?
On arrival at the Sydney airport we were escorted to a hotel where we were required to spend two weeks in a small room. We were not allowed out and no one was allowed to visit us. Meals were delivered to our door and we got daily phone calls from a nurse to check on our health. We also had Covid tests on the second and 10th days and after all our tests were negative we were allowed to leave the hotel. That was a fabulous day!

Where in Australia are you from?
Our home is in Canberra and we are on our way back there after spending some time in Sydney seeing family, and some time enjoying the lovely Australian beach and bush.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Your final months in Calcutta were quite eventful. The fire in your building in the middle of the lockdown must have been a jolt?
Yes, it was certainly a dramatic experience having a fire at our apartment complex, not something we ever had before. It was quite distressing watching the fire get closer and closer to our apartment. It took many hours to extinguish the blaze. We were very blessed to have mostly external damage to the apartment but because it came right underneath we needed safety checks to happen before moving back in.
We spent three months in The Oberoi Grand until our apartment was ready. During that time, of course, Calcutta also experienced Cyclone Amphan. This was our second cyclone in two years as we also experienced a very severe cyclone during our previous posting in Tonga (in the South Pacific).

How are you describing Calcutta to friends back home?
We loved our time in Calcutta. What we most loved was the people who welcomed us so warmly and made us feel at home. When my mother visited Calcutta earlier this year, her most treasured memory was meeting some of the friends we had made, some who were among the doyens of the Calcutta cultural scene, and even visiting their homes. It was very hard for us to leave the many friends we had made there and who unfortunately we didn’t get to see after the lockdown began.
We also loved the history, culture and food of Calcutta. Some of our favourite places to take visitors included the Mallik Ghat flower market, Park Street, Howrah Bridge, Mother House, the Victoria Memorial and even some of the cemeteries, such as South Park Street and the Scottish cemeteries.
I also loved watching an IPL cricket game at Eden Gardens, in which Virat Kohli scored a century, and a soccer match at Salt Lake stadium, in which ATK scored in the last minute to equalise. I was a member of some historic clubs and enjoyed taking people for a meal to experience the old-world feel. I think people also need to experience the bustling streets of Calcutta — the sights, smells and sounds and the people going about their daily lives.

Which were your favourite places in Calcutta?
It’s not so much about the place as the memories that were made there. I was privileged to be invited to many people’s homes where I experienced great food, music and great company. That was one of the things that was so special about Calcutta — how generous people were in inviting us to their homes, clubs or restaurants. It’s something different about Calcutta compared to every other city I have lived in around the world.

Did you develop a liking for any Indian dish?
Even before coming to India I used to love eating Indian food.  Australia is blessed with many Indian restaurants and we also got to experience great Indian cooking when we lived in Malaysia previously. Christine had some fairly authentic curry recipes that we used to make at home.
What we discovered in coming to Calcutta is that Indian cuisine is much more diverse than we realised and is very regional.  What we called Indian in Australia was mostly north Indian style. We had also experienced a lot of south Indian cuisine while we had lived in Malaysia.
I love almost all types of Indian food and some of my favourites include Murgh Tikka Masala, vegetable korma, aloo gobi and anything cooked in a tandoor. We have always loved Indian bread, particularly naan and roti. For lunch, I often enjoyed thali, biryani or dosa from one of the small cafes near my office. Coming to Calcutta, we discovered Bengali food and particularly enjoyed dishes with bekti, kebabs and even the humble kathi roll. I was also taken by friends to iconic places such as 6 Ballygunge Place, Nizam’s, Aliah Hotel and Kasturi, where I got to taste many local dishes. And, of course, some of the best meals we ate were in people’s homes.
I think the mark of how much I love Indian food is my willingness to eat it for breakfast. In all the other countries I lived in I needed to have a familiar western breakfast such as toast or cereal. But in Calcutta, I would often order parathas, luchi or dosas for my breakfast.

What were the high points of your tenure as consul general?
When I came to Calcutta, my job was to establish Australia’s new consulate general there and for it to become a known presence in the city. I believe that my team and I achieved this. We further raised Australia’s profile in the resources sector, where we were already known as a strong supplier of India’s resource requirements but also for expertise in mining equipment, technology and services. We are also raising Australia’s profile in sectors such as education, health, tourism and food and beverages.  
Australia is blessed with a large Indian diaspora who have a great understanding of both countries. Our post in Calcutta, Australia’s fourth diplomatic mission in India, is part of the growth in our relationship.
I was also delighted to host a number of cultural performers in Calcutta in dance, art, film and literature. It was also amazing to be able to promote Australian football in India, including in the village of Angrail near the border with Bangladesh. It was exciting as a new post to host our first ever national day event in Calcutta in February for around 200 guests. It was a great way to thank the many friends who had helped welcome us. You met/hosted some prominent Australians while you were here.
Our shared love for cricket is one of the many things that binds Australia and India together. I grew up watching and playing cricket in Melbourne. So it was pretty exciting that on our very first morning in Calcutta, Christine and I met Michael Clarke at the breakfast buffet. We introduced ourselves and had a very friendly chat before he went off to resume his IPL commentary duties. We also met Steve Smith at our Anzac Day ceremony at Bhowanipore Cemetery where we honoured Australians killed in war. The third former Australian captain we met was Steve Waugh. We met him at Udayan, a home for children of families affected by leprosy, which he has supported for many years. I was also fortunate to meet both former number one cricket umpire Simon Taufel and Bengal’s favourite cricketer, Sourav Ganguly, at the launch of Simon’s book in Calcutta last year.

Anything missing in your Calcutta diary?
I would have certainly loved the opportunity to watch a Test match at Eden Gardens. I was also trying to find ways to be involved in the community more. I was able to do this through my church, Equippers Kolkata. The church has programmes to reach out to poor and vulnerable people. I also met NGOs assisting with providing alternative pathways for women who were in prostitution or victims of human trafficking.
I was also looking forward to travelling throughout my consular jurisdiction including Northeast India, which I never got to visit. I was fortunate to have made some short trips to Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. I’m glad I got to visit Delhi, Mumbai and Jaipur, see the magnificent Taj Mahal and also tigers in the wild at Ranthambore. And it was great that I got to visit Santiniketan also.

What comes next on the personal and professional front?
I will be having some time off in Australia catching up with friends and family and settling back into our house before working out what’s next. After many years overseas we think we may spend some time in Australia again.",culture
The name is D’Evil and his music holds a mirror to real-life experiences," From residing in a chawl in Dadar to releasing his music with Gully Gang Entertainment and featuring in Gully Boy, D’Evil has come a long way. On July 27, the rapper launched a song called Mumbai darshan, paying homage to the city of dreams. In the song, the 31-year-old raps over a subtle yet rhythmic beat, keeping the interest alive in the lyrics while his Apple Memoji travels through different parts of Mumbai on a virtual tour. The Gully Gang Entertainment-produced video received 80,000-plus views within a week of its launch.
D’Evil, aka Dhaval Parab, was formerly known as Hustler and was a part of an ethnic rap group called Munky Rhymz. He grew up watching telecasts of rappers like Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre on MTV before becoming a part of the music scene in 2009 with Kadki and Chal Bhak. In 2020 he released his collaboration (Brinks) with Elvis Brown on Mass Appeal India and the EP Shutdown.
Here’s a chat with the rapper who also moonlights as an illustrator, scriptwriter and actor.

Mumbai darshan means sightseeing in Mumbai but what does the song mean to you?
I grew up in Mumbai and my city means a lot to me. Mumbai darshan is definitely cIose to my heart. I wanted to express Mumbai as a city through my vision, my lyrics and how we all are. It was written when I was at a songwriting camp with the team at Gully Gang Entertainment in Goa and being away from the city is how the thought process came about. This track is all what I want to convey about Mumbai because every time I am out of the city for work, I cannot wait to come back. Every moment in Mumbai is exceptional, that’s why Mumbai is truly called a city of dreams.

So this your way of paying homage to your home?
Absolutely, I express through my lyrics and I am proud to be a Mumbaikar.

We really enjoy the vibe of the track and you keep the interest alive with the beat. How would you describe it?
Initially when the track was ready, I told the producer and friend Karan Kanchan from Gully Gang to make a beat for the track and briefed him. He just came up with the perfect sound. I wanted my audiences to focus on the lyrics more and the melody of the beats which are subtle yet rhythmic with minimal sounds.

The video depicts a virtual tour through Mumbai. What inspired the concept of the video?
The video shows a connection to the Mumbai Western Express Highway, which is one of the most popular roads used to commute and due to its rapid civic infrastructure deployment, I was inspired. In the video you will see elements like streets stalls with names added to it, such as Gully Gang studio (of course), plus the famous theatre Gaiety Galaxy, and other iconic places. Since the lockdown was imposed, I could not record a concept-based video but co-incidentally our content manager, Mohit from Gltch, showed me Apple Memoji and a thought got triggered... that I should make a video using my avatar.

Which parts of the video did Mr Doodlekar do?
(Laughs) Good question! Well I definitely love making doodles. In the video, the buildings, public toilet walls and the stalls have artwork which are done by me.

There is also a pinned comment to the YouTube video of Mumbai darshan, which says: “Comment with the name of the place! We’ll pick the most commented one and take you on a virtual tour.” What does it mean?
You will see something very interesting on this soon. Mohit from Gltch is putting a video together. We represented the city as a whole from the outside but this is going to be the audience’s view and give it a bigger picture.

With the lockdown keeping everyone indoors, do you think your fans will have a better understanding of your music?
First, this is the first time we are witnessing such a pandemic worldwide, which has made the economy take a big hit. Businesses will take quite some time to settle down. Having said that, your passion and the drive to showcase your music does not stop. Yes, it is slowly picking up and the digital medium has taken a new turn and my audiences are definitely finding this new, just like myself. Considering the fact that we often perform live, this is a different vibe… connecting with your fans, greeting and “clicking” on performances. We all are trying our best to put out our music out. Our fans are just amazing.

Let’s talk a bit about you. Your name was Hustler before it became D’Evil. Why the change?
It was a random thought as I was new and wanted to hustle it out. My sister, Aranya Johar, suggested the name D’Evil as it goes with my personality… as I am very notorious… hence I said: “Yes, why not.” That’s it!

You’ve had a knack for writing from a young age. You started writing poetry at age 11 and rap lyrics when you were 16. Was this a talent you discovered or is there also a family member who is a wordsmith?
No, I come from a background where my father was a banker and actor, that is where I learnt a bit of acting, and my mother is a banker. I was very inclined to write since I was young. I would just write and convey my thoughts through poetry or write my mind out. I realised my love to rhyme when I was in school and it picked up pace. Soon enough, I took this up as my passion and career.

Before becoming the artiste you are today, did you take part in rap battles?
My career started with rap battles. I did not know how to record a song, hook or master a track. I would rather participate in online rap communities. I have taken part in rap battles in clubs… these are popular places to get audiences. My second-last battle was me versus EMF… this is how we used to battle before… and the last rap battle I did was in Gully Boy, against MC Sher. Here I am as an artiste, doing different things I love with music.

Besides rapping, you are also an illustrator, actor and scriptwriter.
Rapping is my passion, my career. Other facets, like scriptwriting, doodling, acting… I wanted to explore these areas because I always wanted to learn something new and take up new projects, make my earnings count. Well, acting? I love it!

How are you seeing the Indian hip-hop evolve?
Hip-hop definitely is raising its bar each day. There are so many rappers who have that push now and are showcasing their talents. We are so proud that the community is steadily growing. WAP
Hip-hop stars Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B have released WAP. The duo have also unveiled the music video for the song, which takes place at a luxurious mansion with a fountain. “I just want to let y’all know, I wanna give y’all the heads up, the music video is going to be the censored version of the song, because the song is so nasty that YouTube was like, ‘Hold on, wait a minute, someone might be too Goddamn nasty,” Cardi B said on Instagram prior to the release.

Fool’s Love Affair
Based on a demo Randy Travis recorded in the early 1980s, Fool’s Love Affair is his first song in years. Originally recorded as a demo, the song was rediscovered by one of its writers, Charlie Monk (who wrote it with Milton Brown and Keith Stegall), who sent it to Travis and his longtime producer Kyle Lehning.

My Future
Billie Eilish’s new song — My Future — comes with a fantastic animated music video created by Australian artist Andrew Onorato. She sings: I’m in love but not with anybody else/Just want to get to know myself… a poignant reflection on pandemic era. ",culture
"Jyotee Khaitan puts Arpita in a monsoon lookbook, only for t2"," She talks straight and from the heart. Post a t2 fashion shoot in designer Jyotee Khaitan’s monsoon collection, Arpita chatted with The Telegraph on a rainy Wednesday afternoon on being Arpita and juggling acting, entrepreneurship and being a mother to a teenager.

Your personal style is quite a mixed bag. How has it evolved over the years?
Fashion is something which reflects your personality. In general, I prefer to wear clothes which enhance my personality. Beyond that it depends on the occasion and the season.

Can you decode your personality?
As stated in my Instagram profile: ‘Liberated & opinionated. Believing in dogmatism. Answerable to my conscience only’. I am a complete woman. I am an entrepreneur, actress, singer, dancer and related to almost all sorts of performing arts and I am also a housewife and a mother.

Have you always been like this or have circumstances shaped you?
The fundamentals never change. I don’t feel scared easily and have always had a practical, logical and rational mind. Which is why it is difficult to fool me. In a word, I am rebellious. I have always done things I wanted to do.
With experience and exposure, you evolve. Of course, I have evolved and my Delhi episode taught me a lot. Those learnings were priceless and helped me grow. What are the advantages and disadvantages of being ‘you’?
I am basically an honest person. My mind, heart and what I say are always aligned. Life is all about balance. I think I am a balanced person. I don’t regret the way I am. I am flexible, adjusting and gel well with everyone… from kids to seniors. I love talking to people, observing them and learn things hands-on. I love travelling and have a keen interest in culture and food. I love interacting with the locals. I am moody and that is a disadvantage. At times, I am stubborn. These are flaws.

Are the flaws slowly changing with age and experience?
That’s my intention. Knowing your problems is half the cure. I am constantly working on these things. I have a very special person in my life. He is a mentor to me and he constantly tells me to work on these. He tries to make me understand what needs to be done.

Would you like to share the name of your mentor?
I would love to share his name and much more with you over a cup of coffee! (Laughs)

How is your mood treating you this lockdown?
Well, it was difficult to cope with at the beginning. After my marriage (to actor Prosenjit Chatterjee) in 2003, I became a housewife. I didn’t work for seven years. So, it was a similar kind of a lockdown situation for me. I know all cleaning, cooking and other household work. Name anything and I have done it. So, it wasn’t new to me. The difficult part was to be stable mentally, which is related to the financial uncertainty. That’s still there.

Were you glad that you were in Calcutta?
For the last three-four years I have been in Calcutta. I have been shooting back to back (before lockdown came calling). Four of them released and the rest were scheduled. In fact, I was travelling for an outdoor shoot to Bagdogra and had checked in as well when I got a message that the shooting had to be called off. It would have been terrible if I had got stuck out of the city indefinitely.
The most relieving thing is that my son who studies in the UK (Class X; Millfield, Glastonbury, UK) is here. It was a last-minute arrangement and tough, but luckily, I managed to get him back. Had that not happened, I would have landed in the hospital. He has been in a boarding school for the past eight years and this is the first time he has been able to spend so much time with me at a stretch.

How are you making the most of it?
We are spending quality time, watching content, watching football games because he loves it. I learn a lot of things from him every day. The new generation, digital kids are so smart. It’s not as if they are asking you questions all the time. For that they have Google and hundreds of apps. He is particular about his workout as he is a part of his school’s football team and is conscious about what he eats. Sundays are cheat days. We order online or I cook for him.
How is it being a mother to a teenager?
Don’t even ask. Parenting is the most difficult job and once you are a mother, you are a mother forever. Teenage years are worst. I am dealing with it.

And, you have gone back to your Shab haircut…
I
think it suits me the best. I thought of giving myself a new look as we went into unlock mode. Also, I have started travelling to Delhi again (for her digital venture). Maintaining long hair with all the safety protocols is really difficult. So, given the situation, this was the right time to chop it off.

You had once told us that films were no longer a priority. Has the focused shifted back to films?
For the last two years, the way it has panned out, I have shifted my focus back to acting, which was not the case earlier. I was busy with my company and anything new needs your attention. With it up and running, I have shifted a significant amount of my attention to films. My connection with entrepreneurship and Delhi will always be there.
The audience really missed you…
I am fortunate. A lot of my films are by new directors and producers, which is a good sign for the industry that a lot of new talents are coming up who will take the industry forward. And, they depend on me. When I do a film, I own it. I am just not an actress who will switch off after pack-up. I am equally involved in pre-production and post-production, giving my inputs from my two-decade experience. The OTT platforms have also opened a new window for these talents in every sector.

Are you enjoying the OTT platforms, like all of us?
I have always enjoyed OTT. You have the world’s best content, which is not possible in theatres. The sparkling Indian content is also fabulous. I would love to be part of a web project.

What is next for you?
I have two projects in the pipeline. Both are outdoor based.
On the other hand, our Delhi-based start-up has just got acquired. Being a serial entrepreneur, I am exploring some new opportunities in Delhi.",culture
Singer Kishore Kumar was also a composer par excellence," Kishore Kumar’s prolific singing and acting is well known, but not so much his composing ability — a treasure trove of mostly high-quality offering, spanning exquisite classical-based songs, soulful ballads, folk/bhatiali and foot-tapping Western-style numbers.
Around 1958-59, perhaps buoyed by the twin success of his productions Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi and Lukochuri, Kishore was mulling entering multiple aspects of film-making — story-writing, composing and directing — in a more serious way. After two aborted attempts, Neela Aasmaan and Suhaana Geet, he finally turned composer with Jhumroo (1961). As the screen opened out to the wide canvas of a toy train meandering up the majestic Himalayas and the words “Story by Kishore Kumar” flashed on the screen to his sonorous voice belting out the iconic title song (which he also wrote), the audience was in for a unique and immersive musical ride. Kishore, the composer, had arrived. He composed 11 songs for the film, an eclectic mix of romantic ditties, delectable Westernised numbers and raga-based fun songs replete with tribal chants and unusual percussion instruments. As if by providence, it was in the same year that R.D. Burman made his debut. Less than a decade later, this duo was to change the sound of Hindi film music forever.
The films that he made and, consequently, their soundtracks, wavered between two extremes. Serious, philosophical (somewhat melodramatic) films with nary a light moment — starting with Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein (his directorial debut) and ending with the posthumously released Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein, with Door Ka Rahi and the songless, musicless Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin in between. The basic plot premise was that of the eternal journeyman, an outlier perpetually wronged and misunderstood by society. And, for each of the three films, by design or by accident, he managed to pull out a Shailendra song, sometimes years after the lyricist’s passing, and retrofit it to create a binding leitmotif.
ADVERTISING
Ads by Teads And then there were the “loony films”, featuring him as the principal clown — as if mimicking his own perceived image among critics and the audience. While the quality of the films varied from zany brilliance (Badhti Ka Naam Dadhi, with its fourth wall breaks and esoteric inside jokes referencing his idols, Topol, Brando and Christopher Lee) to low-browed comedy (Shabash Daddy), the soundtracks were par excellence, displaying an astonishing range and creative depth. As an aside, Bappi Lahiri debuted as actor-singer in Badhti Ka Naam Dadhi. The other films in this genre were Hum Do Daaku and Chalti Ka Naam Zindagi, a rather cringeworthy sequel to his earlier runaway hit production.
Enthralling numbers
In terms of sheer variety, there were folk/bhatiali-based compositions like Main ek panchhi matwala re and Teri jeevan gaadi, raga-based melodies like Todke bandhan sarey in Brindavani Sarang, the incandescent Beqarar dil in Kirwani (that marked Sulakshana’s debut) and Naa re naa in Tilang (impressively rendered by his wife, Leena), a moving bhajan (O jag ke rakhwale), a delightful qawwali, Yeh mohabbat kya karenge, as authentic as it gets, with harmonium, handclaps and an extended alaap that would have made Roshan proud, a Marathi natya sangeet (Mehmood’s Mr. Ghanekar), and out-of-the-box situational songs, like the riotous “suicide song” in Parsee-dialected Gujarati, sung by the actors themselves (I.S. Johar, Bhagwan, Sundar and Maruti).
For Panthi hoon main, he seamlessly stitched together two Tagore songs, adding dollops of his own ingenuity, to create a masterpiece that is no less enthralling than the originals in question. He also borrowed liberally from Western compositions, like Frank Sinatra’s Love and Marriage (Pyar aur shaadi), Paul Anka’s Love Is A Lonely Song (Pyar ajnabi hai — unreleased), Cab Calloway’s Minnie The Moocher (Haseeno nazneeno) and the two masterclass adaptations — Julius La Rosa’s Domani (Thandi hawa ye) and Victor Young’s theme from Shane (Neela Aasmaan, title song).
He once composed outside his home production for Zameen Aasmaan, a top-notch soundtrack that had music lovers craving for more. But given he was then the industry’s numero uno male singer, composing was evidently not his priority but rather a whim.

His Bengali efforts
In 1973, Kishore composed his first Bengali Puja songs, a game-changing single featuring Noyono shoroshi keno, a stunning potpourri of three ragas, and Ei je nodi, a haunting tune grounded in folk but with a very sophisticated treatment with electric and acoustic rhythm guitars, congas, and a revved-up echo.
He composed 41 Bengali non-film songs (including a somewhat dreary, 26-minute-long musical drama, Rakhal Chandra Matal), of which he sang 23 and Amit Kumar sang 14. His own (sung) songs ranged from exquisite raga-based melodies, like the masterpiece in Puriya Dhanashree, Amar deep nebhano raat, and Amaar moner ei in Malgunji, to authentic folk (Manush jonmo diye bidhi) to the desolate Sedino akashe to the frenetic, Western-style Keno tumi chupi chupi, embellished with incredible vocal callisthenics and yodeling.
For the 1974 Pujas, Kishore and Lata (and HMV) sprang a delightful surprise on the listener when they composed for each other. Lata’s Ki likhi tomay and Bhalobashar agun jwele, especially the latter, with their magnificent melodic content, would rank among the finest she has sung for any composer in Bengali, and that list is an illustrious one. Kishore also composed two songs for Hema Malini, beautiful tunes but the trepidation in her voice and the off-key singing somewhat marred the end product. He reserved some of his most dulcet tunes for Amit (his son), who sang them earnestly, but occasionally struggled with the more challenging tunes and the complex legato notes. Amit’s many notable songs include Aaj ghore deep jwole, a honey-dripping Yaman with a slight Tagore-ish touch, and Pheraari hoyechhe mon, an astounding composition with an infectious guitar-keyboard-based arrangement.

The ‘varied’ sound of his music
Like the acting and singing chameleon that he was, Kishore’s composing too was deceptive and did not conform to any distinguishable style. While Na ro ae mere dil (Zameen Aasmaan) could pass off as a Madan Mohan composition, Kisne yahan kisko jaana from the same soundtrack — with its Arabic chant and the castanets — will remind one of R.D. Burman’s Matwali aankhon wale. Not having a regular team of his own, he worked mostly with renowned arrangers like Suhrid Kar (S.D. Burman), Basu Chakrabarti and team Pancham, and Frank Fernand (Kalyanji-Anandji), and this too might have contributed somewhat to the varied “sound” of his music.
Kishore composed around 120 songs, an output not too insignificant, and similar in volume to the venerated Sajjad Hussain’s. Still, while the latter is (rightfully) mentioned with hushed reverence by connoisseurs and wannabe music critics alike, the same recognition seems to elude Kishore. Perhaps the pitfalls of being multifaceted.

Amit Kumar’s latest single focuses on adapting to the new normal post the coronavirus outbreak and his musical journey," Singer-composer Amit Kumar has come out with a new single titled Raat ashe, written by Sreeraj Mitra, which talks about the difficult times we are facing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the subsequent lockdown and Cyclone Amphan that left a trail of destruction in its wake in Bengal. Launched on July 31 by Asha Audio, the track with its lyrical depth conveys the message of “going forward towards a new tomorrow” despite the difficulties. Son of the maverick genius Kishore Kumar, Amit talks to The Telegraph about life, music and his father.

How have you been during this lockdown period?
The lockdown has helped me reset myself. It’s like a new beginning. I am doing online shows now from home. Since this is what the future will look like probably, it’s a dress rehearsal.

Has it been a creative phase for you?
Before the coronavirus outbreak, I had a number of shows lined up like one on the late Sahir Ludhianvi with Dharmendraji in Ludhiana in March. But naturally things went haywire. The entertainment industry has taken a major hit. It’s a bad time for musicians.

Tell us about Raat ashe, your new song.
It’s a Bengali single that was recorded here in Gouri Kunj (the bungalow of legendary singer-actor Kishore Kumar in Mumbai). It has been tuned by Rocket Mondal, who has been working with me for close to 40 years now and it has been written by Sreeraj Mitra. It is a song of hope and speaks about the difficult times we all are facing due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Life has come to a standstill. Compounding to the woes was Cyclone Amphan which left Bengal devastated. The single talks about a comeback to normality. It will be released by Asha Audio.

So how was the recording done?
Initially I was hesitant because the studio at my home had been dismantled and it needed a few repairs as well. And there was no question of stepping out of home to record it. No studio was running operations then. This was around a month-and-a-half back. So we had to fall back on technology. We ran the software and I sang it here in my office after Rocket sent me the track. Thankfully, everything went well.

You carry a rich musical legacy. Tell us about the journey.
Legacy is a dangerous word. I have never thought of it as such. When I started in the early 1970s, I didn’t face too many hurdles. I didn’t have to struggle, it’s true. It was a different world back then. My journey comprised lots of highs and lows. I have worked with the best music directors of the times, delivered hits. No one did a favour just because I happened to be Kishore Kumar’s son. The Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo said, “Hum tumse gaana gawa rahe hai isliye nahi ki tu dada ka ladka hai. Tere mein kuch nahi hota toh hum kyun gawate?” And my father was not that kind of a man to ask for favours for his son. He was against it.

How easy or tough was it being Kishore Kumar’s son?
There will be comparisons but I had to compete with a giant, an absolute legend. In that context, my journey was difficult. But I took it in my stride. I have achieved the success that I deserved. R.D. Burman made me sing a few songs that he believed only I could do justice to.

Your father never received classical training as we know. What about you? Did you train in music?
It’s good that my father never trained in classical music otherwise he would have never become the legend, I believe. But see, even without a formal training he is still the most popular singer. I learnt light classical music for eight years under Pandit Satyanarayan Mishra and it paid dividends. Before that I had learnt under Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan saab. I had also been to Manna Dey on my father’s recommendation.

Tell us about your riyaaz now?
Let me be honest. I don’t do riyaaz now. What I am doing regularly are yoga and exercise. I do a lot of deep breathing. I meditate.

Tell us how you started out?
I used to sing my father’s songs during Durga Puja in the Calcutta paras. My first performance was in Uttam Kumar’s para (Bhowanipore). He only had asked me to sing. My mother rang up my father to complain when she came to know I was whiling away my time singing in localities. Hearing it, my father had said, “Very good, very good” (laughs). Baba flew down to see me perform at Rabindra Sadan. He was very happy and wanted me to go to Bombay then.

Your early days in Mumbai?
I loved Bombay. I lived in Calcutta but I used to travel to Bombay during vacations. Baba used to take me around, visit cinemas. It was a lot of fun. He even made a film with me (Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein), which was based on The Proud Rebel (1958) and Satyajit Ray’s Pather Panchali (1955).

You have worked a lot with R.D. Burman. Tell us about the experience.
I have worked on more than 170 songs with him. Our families and the Burmans went back a long way. After my father decided to move in here (Gouri Kunj), S.D. Burman was with him during the griha pravesh puja. I met Pancham Da in the early 60s, when he came to our place during rehearsals for Jaago sonewalo in Mehmood’s Bhoot Bungla. My father and Mehmood shared a great rapport from their struggling days in Bombay Talkies. When I heard R.D. Burman’s Matwali aankhon wali from Chhote Nawab, I knew this man would redefine music.

How was Kishore Kumar as a father?
He was not at all strict. He was very friendly and sweet. He was against smoking and drinking. He gave me a long rope and never forced me to do anything. He was concerned about my voice though.

Your birthday was on July 3. What did you gift yourself?
I launched my company — the Kumar Brothers Music channel on YouTube.

Any regrets?
No regrets in my life. I just want to say to everyone, ‘Don’t hurt any artiste. Don’t hit below the belt. Don’t degrade anyone. Please don’t compare me to my father. I am his son but I have my own style.

"With half your face covered by masks, the eyes would have to do the talking!"," Let’s face it, masks are here to stay and we must step out wearing masks to keep us protected and away from the coronavirus. But with masks becoming an essential part of our face, our lipsticks have taken a back seat, thus shifting attention to our eyes only. With most of us stepping out to work or otherwise, here are some of the easiest eye make-up tutorials that you can try out. Besides, a little make-up hurt nobody, right?

1. If you are not the experimenter, stick to classics. One can go for bold winged eyes with the extension of the liner to the inner corner of the eyes giving it a sharp feline look. Opt for well-brushed broad brows to complement the bold dark eyes.

2. Add a spurt of colour in your eye make-up to brighten up your day. Since masks are essential you can choose a shade that is similar to the mask. Here we went for green eye crayon pencil to complement the shade of the mask. A bold stroke on the lower lid and lots of mascara will open up your eyes.

3. If you are in a mood to experiment, dual liners are fun! Pick two shades that complement each other and draw your eyes half-and-half for the funky look.
Pro-tip: “Always opt for lighter shades on the insides of the eye and a dark one at the tail of the liner; it makes your eyes look bigger,” said Mainak.

4. Your lipsticks are drying up because you don’t have opportunity to wear them because you have your mask on? Fret not, you can use them carefully as eye liners too! “If you want to highlight the lower portion of the eyes then you can use a single stroke or mixed contrast colour by using eyeshadow or matte lipstick. If you cover the lower part then no need to cover the upper one, otherwise it will look messy. But if anyone has a puffy portion beneath the eye then you should avoid the lower part,” explained Mainak who used a mix of pink and violet matte lipsticks for this look.

5. If you have almond-shaped eyes and love colours, set the base of the eyes properly. Take a lip liner or a pop eye liner shade and contour the eyes according to their shape and let the line end around the outer crease of your eyes.
  Given face masks would be the new normal hereafter, eye make-up will surely gain more prominence as everyone will be covering their face with masks in the post-pandemic era. In this situation you look more attractive with bold elegant eyes. Black works the best.
You can make your eyes more bold and attractive by using a lot of vibrant colours, with the help of different eyeshadows palettes that are available.
One hack you can use now is, use matte lipsticks instead of eyeshadows but use it for the exterior only and do not apply it inside your eyes.
Keep a cue tip with you as it always comes handy to wipe off any error or extra lines.
Do not forget to brush off the extra powder underneath your eyes for a clean and fresh look. 1. Look 1:
If minimal defines you, then opt for graphic lines. Take a simple liquid liner and ensure the brush is thin, this gives precision but for best results opt for pot liners. Keeping in mind the shape of the eyes, draw lines but take a break and keep checking the mirror with a straight face to see how it is looking and to maintain uniformity.
2. Look 2:
Love drama and dramatic red eyes but find it hard to pull off the smokey red eye look? Try red liner! Here Sonam used a red liquid lipstick to wing her eyes, which after drying was carefully bordered with a black outline. Well-brushed brows and lots of mascara completed her look.
3. Look 3:
For glamorous eyes, first set the base of the eyes. Once that is done, choose a light and neutral shade and blend it all over the eyelid and continue doing so towards the outer corner of the eyes near the waterline. Then take a shimmery shade and apply it at the inner corner of the eyes and take a white liner and outline with an angular brush. Let it dry. This is ideal for anyone with hooded or small eyes as white liner helps to open up your eyes. Don’t forget to finish the glam look with some mascara!

Jaan Kumar Sanu launches first original single," Jayesh Bhattacharya, 26, is trying to find a foothold in the industry where his father ruled in the ’90s. And what better way to introduce himself than give himself a name that tells the world who his father is? Jaan Kumar Sanu speaks to The Telegraph on the eve of the release of his single Tu sandali on YouTube.

Why did Jayesh Bhattacharya become Jaan Kumar Sanu?
My daknaam is Jaan. Growing up, people in the industry knew me by that name. Since I am following in my father’s footsteps, I decided to take his name.

Who trained you in music?
My first teacher was my Dadon, my mother’s mother, Neera Dutta. She taught me so many Bengali songs. Then I learnt from Subhra Dasgupta. Now I am training under Pandit Ratan Mohan Sharma of Mewati gharana, a nephew of Pt. Jasraj.
 
How did this single happen?
I got invited to the launch of a studio of Aagaaz Entertainment. There Anjan bhaiya of Joy-Anjan duo told me we should do a project together. Then the lockdown happened and everything got pushed back. Two weeks back, I got a message from him, asking me to prepare this song Tu sandali in my own style. I was worried how the recording would be amid the lockdown. But Neeraj bhaiya (Neeraj Tiwari, the owner of Aagaaz Entertainment) and Anjan bhaiya handled everything so well, maintaining safety protocol.

It is a nice soft romantic song. It has been arranged in a modern way.

How much influence does your father have on your music?
I always reach out to him when I have any doubt.

Do you stay together?
No. I stay in Andheri, Baba stays in Goregaon. I am the youngest of three brothers. The eldest, Jesse, is a teacher, the second brother, Zicco, is a graphic designer. He also produces music as a hobby. We stay with our mother Rita, who is also a very good singer.

You released a cover of the Kumar Sanu hit from Akele Hum Akele Tum, Dil mera churaya kyun in 2018. Was that your first release?
It was my first music video with Venus. Before that I did a remake of Chirodini tumi je amar in 2016 with them.

You played the piano in the Dil mera churaya video.
I play 10-15 instruments — harmonium, tabla, piano, guitar….

Have you got any help from your father in your career?
He believes I should get everything on my own. He says if I achieve something on my own, I will appreciate its value. My mother, too, taught me that lesson. My father’s story of how he came into the industry on his own inspires me.

Did you meet his peers while growing up?
No, I did not get that benefit. But I’m glad I did not. I have learnt how tough it is to meet the legendary figures. I have met some on my own like Anu Malik uncle, Nadeem-Shravan uncle, Pyarelal uncle. I even sang in front of Kalyanji uncle as a
five-year-old. I have worked with Anandji uncle. When I meet them, they are shocked and say: ‘So, you are Kumar Sanu’s son? Why didn’t you come before?’

You did some recordings as a child, didn’t you?
My first recording was for Babul Bose uncle for the film Escape from Taliban. I was six or seven then. I had sung with Sonu Nigam sir. He is one of the reasons I became a singer. I had released an album at the age of eight years, titled Tomra Shunbe Toh. It got me into Limca Book of Records as the youngest singer. I also sung Bum bum bole in Taare Zameen Par.

How did you land the Taare Zameen Par song?
I am working since I was five. I used to do a lot of voiceovers in cartoons. I have worked with Shankar Mahadevan uncle, Shantanu Moitra dada, Antara Chowdhury didi. We had a child singers’ group. That’s how I got the contact.
 
At that age did you know how big a film it was?
I had no idea what we were singing for. It was only when Aamir (Khan) sir walked in that I realised that this was a big song. He recorded the start of the song — Chaka raka chi chai — that is in his voice. He had so much fun with us. We had dinner together. I regret not clicking a picture with Aamir sir that day.

"Rannvijay Singha on the importance of being well groomed. Men, are you listening?"," He grew up in an army family in the midst of well-groomed men. And, that has stayed with Rannvijay Singha. The personable and warm MTV Roadies winner, now a successful anchor who has also dabbled in films and has a massive youth connect, is a part of a grooming brand for men, called Whiskers. “The idea is to make people aware about men’s grooming…. ‘Oh yaar mere paas time nahin haan… I am a rough-and-tough kind of a guy’… but when you are interacting with people, it shows your personality. Appearance is important when you are representing yourself and expressing yourself. It is an ongoing process. I am glad that the market has opened up a little bit,” Rannvijay, the co-founder, tells The Telegraph. Excerpts.

What is proper grooming for you?
My father was in the army. I was always surrounded by army officers. My uncles, my grandfather… everybody was an army officer. You see army officers... they are always well-groomed and well turned-out, spick and span and smart, with a nice haircut. I always thought that that’s the way to be... to have your shirt tucked in. It was an everyday thing. That’s the way an officer would present himself.
Eventually with generations, time changes. So now the haircut is not similar to the army officer’s, but it’s always groomed and styled. Your nails are always cut because I was in a boarding school. Grooming is part of basic hygiene and actual discipline according to me. You got to dress smart and according to the occasion.
My father and grandfather have beards. If you see my dad’s photograph, his beard is always well-groomed and in shape. In the olden days, they used to put sarson ka tel and it was organic. Now with the kind of lifestyle that we lead, I think you need to take care of it. It should look good and not scruffy. Everybody likes somebody who takes pride in themselves and takes care of themselves. The pride is in whatever look they want to go with.

When did you become aware of the importance of grooming?
In boarding school. Of course I am in the industry where fashion (plays a large part). So, you try long hair. But personal grooming… being clean, using a deodorant, moisturising. I am very rough and tough and I don’t have to prove it by looks. My actions would prove that. I might be on a bike going to Leh but can’t be having chapped lips. Some people tend to overdo it also. Grooming is personal. It depends on what balance you want to create.

Since I have started growing my beard, it was great to have the Whiskers beard oil because that gives a great fragrance and texture. Even Prianka (wife) says it smells great. So, do it for yourself and also for the people around you.
When did you think of launching a brand?
Between my other partners Aakash (Goswami) and Hardik (Varia) and myself, we’ve been thinking about it for a couple of years, but got into it full-fledged last year. We wanted to do something different and come up with things which are not available. If you have a tattoo, that also needs to be taken care of. A lot of people over the last 10 years have gotten tattoos. We came up with a tattoo product which is not at all available in India. We came up with tattoo wax. It gives it a good shine and it nurtures it. Then there is a moisturising cream. A lot of these things were thought of as a consumer. This is a made-in-India brand which I am very proud of.
If you see the product, it is no less than any international brand. My mother-in-law is from London. When I showed her the product, she said: ‘Isko Selfridges mein kiu nahin rakhte?’ I told her: ‘I know the quality is such, but we as Indians also deserve this’. Made in India and also consumed in India is what we want.

Why the name Whiskers?
The name is royal. It is not very obvious. Beard is in now. Even in the metropolitan cities, a lot of people are growing beards. Whiskers will connect with everyone. It is a cool and catchy name. Women like whiskers because it is not too masculine and something that cats have… big cats. I wanted the brand to connect with women too in the sense that they would want to pick it up for men in their lives. With Raksha Bandhan approaching, sisters could buy it for their brothers. The logo is that of a cool, uber chic, confident man.

Do you also believe that ‘Jiske paas mooch nahin ... uske paas mann hi nahin hai?!’
We are in a world where human beings are fighting against discrimination. At this point, we should be okay with everything. We are saying bachche ko bhi yeh maat batao ke woh male hai ya female hai. At the end of the day, we got to respect people for who and what they are. I have seen my father and grandfather in a beard. So, for me, I am most comfortable with a bit of a beard. I haven’t shaved for many years.

A lot of people snigger at boys who love grooming. There is nothing feminine about grooming, right?
Not at all. I am saying if a boy relates to be feminine, there is nothing wrong with that. Grooming gives people confidence.

What are your favourites from the range?
If I go out, I use the hair products from Whiskers and use the beard oil a lot. The tattoo cream is so nice that I sometimes use it as a moisturiser. There is a charcoal face scrub that I use. I am so heavily emotionally invested in everything, even the packaging, it is almost like saying aapne bhai o or beheno mein se batado favourite kaun hai!  

Do you have a grooming ritual?
It varies and depends on what I am doing. If I am on a trek, at a higher altitude area, the only thing I do is brush my teeth and wash my face. I cut my nails as regularly as I can. I trim my beard every four-five days. If I am trekking or going on a bike ride for 10-15 days, you can’t take so many things, because you are only operating out of a bag.

Do the ladies in your life — your wife and daughter— have a say about any part of your grooming ritual?
After I take a shower, I generally put the beard oil and my daughter (Kainaat) will hug me and say: ‘Dad, I like your smell’. When I met Prianka for the first time, she did notice that I am a guy who smells good.

You have been an youth icon. What are you telling your daughter about boys?
By not specifying a difference between a man and a woman is the most natural way to bring up a child. As kids, we played the same sport. The equality between a man and a woman was not a problem in my head till the time I was in the bubble of the Indian Army. Today there is a lot of chatter thankfully. When you don’t discriminate, kids learn that. Right now there is a football class going on where girls and boys are playing together.",culture
Gurbax turns the beat around on his new single with Beats Antique," After hits like Boom Shankar and Aghori, Bangalore-based producer GURBAX, aka Kunaal Gurbaxani, has collaborated with electronic and experimental group Beats Antique (from the US) on their new single Dirty South, which released last month. The track, produced by the 28-year-old, draws in South Indian influences along with the sound of dirty South hip-hop that’s well-known in Southern American states. The track pays homage to the cultures that molded GURBAX’s creativity from his times in Bangalore and Atlanta.
A chat with the artiste who has opened for names like Steve Aoki, Marshmello, Wiz Khalifa and TroyBoi.

How did the collaboration with Beats Antique happen?
I moved from Bangalore to Atlanta for college in 2009 and I got my first introduction to electronic music through a few artistes from there… artistes who were prolific during that time… in way of touring. Some of those artistes were Bassnectar and Beats Antique. Beats Antique was one of the first electronic live performances that I had seen right at the cusp of when I was getting into electronic music. So that was the first time I got to listen to them. Couple of years later I moved back to India and decided to pursue music and I got a call from a friend who asked me if I wanted to open for David Satori (of Beats Antique) for his tour. The gig was in Goa, so I ended up there and we ended up bonding for the next few days and at that point there was a talk of a collaboration but I was really young as an artiste. So over the years I kept in touch and last year when I was on a tour of North America I ended up meeting him at the studio, jamming on this beat I had cooked up and he loved it. Over the next couple of months we flashed it out, they started sending me the recording of the violins and drums and the song culminated.

You called the nadaswaram the voice of the track, but it’s not an unknown sound to us….
The philosophy in my previous songs have kind of been similar but with this song, what kind of made it special was that it represents Bangalore to me and Bangalore to me is home because I’ve lived here for such a long time. So I wanted to make music people of South India can relate to. And this is my way of celebrating the culture I have grown up with.

There’s a lot happening on the track. There’s trap, hip-hop, some experimental stuff, the drum-and-violin recordings…. Did it make you push your boundaries while putting the track together?
With this song I wanted to keep it simple. But while I was working on it, things just kept adding. The way I look at it is that even though a track, from a production standpoint might be complex, you would still want it to have a cohesive, simple idea, which is easy for people to latch on to. Over the years as I’ve matured as a producer, I always felt that the true sign of maturity is presenting complex ideas in a simple way. Then you’re able to stand out, be unique but also have this appeal to a large audience. People don’t listen to music for complexity, they listen to music to feel good.

Coming back to Beats Antique, what is it that you like about their flow of music?
They are one of the most unique artistes that I have ever seen. When I saw them live, straight off the bat, the way they dress, they’re so out there. They dress up as if they are a part of a circus act (chuckles). They are a three-person band with David (Satori) who does a lot of the melodic section, (Sidecar) Tommy who plays the drums and there’s Zoe (Jakes) who’s actually the belly dancer. It’s almost like a live performance musical act. So that also really drew me to them.

Before this love for electronic music, you used to play the guitar in a rock and trash metal band?
Yes, I used to hate electronic music then (laughs). When I was playing the guitar, it was just a fun hobby. It wasn’t anything I thought could be a profession. It was one of those stereotypical reasons why you get into music… listening to a song and showing off to your friends by playing it.

What else can we expect in the near future?
In the next month or so there will be another single coming out and then I have an EP which will come later in the year and I’m also going to have a music video out for Dirty South.

Could we get an insight into your EP?
The EP marks a shift in terms of my sound. The music I have been exploring is this desi, trap kind of zone but the EP is different. It actually is less electronic in some way and more vocal-oriented. It has songs that are straight up English, pop record and there are other hybrid songs, like a hybrid Punjabi, English and hip-hop track.",culture
Busting myths about mythology with Devdutt Pattanaik," At a time when history is often tweaked to suit a skewed narrative, Devdutt Pattanaik is a mythologist who tells the stories of our scriptures in their truest form and hopes that people learn from them. He defines mythology as our cultural truth and believes in a form of storytelling that offers the wholesome picture so that we realise that it is actually a great thing to be called a “Sati-Savitri” and not something to be ashamed of. At a recent YFLO session, Pattanaik addressed some of these misinterpretations of our mythology, especially those of women-centric stories, in his usual crisp, articulate manner. Excerpts.  

Sati-Savitri and their relevance today
I have often heard people say, “Don’t be a Sati-Savitri.” I have heard it everywhere and find it funny because these women from our scriptures should be role models and, maybe, people don’t want you to become like them because they don’t want you to have a mind of your own! Sati’s story comes from the Shiv Puran and Savitri’s story comes from the Mahabharata and both of them are women that make up their own minds, choose their own husbands and live the way they want to live, on their own terms. These are women with agency and sometimes people think that this is a new word that Western feminism has composed but these stories were written thousands of years ago.
The problem is that their stories are never told like they should be — these are stories of powerful, independent women. There is a diversity of women out there and not just one kind to be a feminist — there is Annapurna, who manages the kitchen, there is Durga, who goes to the battlefield, there is Lakshmi, who is whimsical. We are told that Lakshmi is at Vishnu’s feet but the story is that she presses his feet of her own volition and if she gets irritated, she will leave and then Vishnu has to run around the world to find her — she is chanchala. Parvati tells Shiva that she wants a child but Shiva says no because he is immortal. However, Parvati points out that she wasn’t asking but telling him and she creates Ganesha herself and Shiva, the hermit, becomes a householder. I work a lot for TV and they say stories of independent women won’t work and I tell them to at least try. It’s how you tell the story!   Mythology vs mythological fiction
Mythology is subjective truth — your truth and my truth, the culture’s truth. Every culture looks at the world in a particular way and that is communicated through generations with the help of stories, symbols and rituals and this is mythology. Things like God, spirit and rebirth are not scientific concepts as they are a matter of faith and come in the world of mythology. A myth is a cultural truth communicated through stories, irrespective of religion. Mythological fiction is when a writer is using mythlogy and then presenting his point of view through those stories and sometimes creates new characters. When Amish (Tripathi) is writing a book, he is writing mythological fiction and I have written one book like that, which is The Pregnant King. So fiction is nobody’s truth, fact is everyone’s truth and mythology is somebody’s truth.
Relevance of the scriptures
The story of Ramayana proceeds because both Surpanakha and Raavan refuse to listen to Ram and Sita, respectively, when they say no. All our scriptures are based on stories about men with fragile egos, for example, Drapaudi’s situation in the Mahabharata. The Kauravas are big bullies and the story is about handling the complex problem of bullying. Meanwhile, Ramayana is about consent. Stories of Saraswati help you understand knowledge while stories of Lakshmi help you understand wealth and Parvati helps you learn about resilience and patience. And this is how stories have to be told for the 21st century.

Dealing with the current crisis
Mythology is a collection of wisdom from people for over a thousand years. How to Become Rich: 12 Lessons I Learnt from Vedic and Puranic Stories was written because it works in the Indian system and similar western books work in the western world. With regard to the present situation, the one thing that will not change is that people will still be hungry and that’s the key of Arthasastra. Hunger is not only for food but also for clothing, shelter and status. The logistics have changed due to the situation but we know that within three-four months, some kind of normalcy will be restored. There are mentions of plagues in the scriptures too and even at the Jagannath temple, he goes for a long slumber during which time, the temple remains under a lockdown of sorts but then the Rath Yatra starts. So in a way, our scriptures have also told us that this happens. The big lesson we have learnt over here is to not keep all our eggs in the same basket, which is China.
In India, we have a problem of governance as these people are not very smart. Ram is a king but Krishna is not a king. Even Vishnu takes different forms to play different roles but in our country, politicians think that today they can be the finance minister and tomorrow they can be the defence minister! Scriptures are very clear when they say that go to Lakhmi for wealth and Saraswati for knowledge as there is nobody who is sarvagunsampanna. There is a reason why Vishwaroop does not have a single temple in the country. Hopefully, our politicians will really look at our gods to learn!  ",culture
"Perumal Murugan and translator Nandini Krishnan on Estuary, his latest offering"," Perumal Murugan, the sublime writer of fiction in Tamil and the creator of award-winning works like Poonachi (translated by N. Kalyan Raman) and Madhurobhagan (One Part Woman; translated by Aniruddhan Vasudevan) decided to explore what are famously considered errors in fiction-writing while penning his latest offering, Estuary (Eka; 243 pp; Rs 499). “One could call it deviant to be excited by errors. Deviance has been the starting point for various arts,” writes the author in the foreword of the tale set in Asuralokam, where a father and a son navigate a world that is oftentimes sinful. Kumarasurar spirals down a path of extreme anxiety and distress upon hearing a seemingly innocent request from his son who is away in college. Set in an urban setting, the tale is a commentary on our social surroundings through the musings of a father. It doesn’t take a reader too long to understand that we reside in Asuralokam ourselves and find bits of ourselves in Kumarasurar’s troubles and his son Meghas’s demands. Translated into English by Nandini Krishnan, who has also previously written books in English called Hitched: The Modern Indian Woman and Arranged Marriage and Invisible Men: Inside India’s Transmasculine Networks, Estuary is a free-flowing ride down a stream of consciousness that few authors can successfully achieve. The Telegraph spoke to the author and his translator over email to understand the thoughts that went into penning Estuary. Excerpts. What made you suddenly depart from a rural setting and set Estuary in an urban setting?
So many unexpected things occur in one’s life, and so they do in one’s writing. You could plan for every circumstance, but then something entirely unplanned might happen all of a sudden. This novel, with its urban setting, is one of those things that just came to me. Initially, I had my doubts about whether I could build an entire novel around this new backdrop, but as I wrote, the story grew. It became hard to control my fingers as they typed away.

Tell us about the Estuary journey, from inception to execution.
As with rishis and rivers, it’s hard to trace a novel to its origin too. There is no one in my generation who doesn’t complain about their problems with their children. One seems to be able to talk only about one’s offspring. I’m a writer. I’m able to view things from various perspectives. And so I tend to point out how the situation must appear from their children’s perspectives. It must have been such conversations with my friends that became the seed for this novel. Once I decide to write a novel, I first write it in my head. And so I did with this one. When I needed some information, my son helped me out. I wrote the bulk of it during a month-long writer’s residency at Manipal University. I finished it a while after returning home.

You have said in your foreword that you purposely wanted to fill your book with ‘errors’. Could you tell us about the thought that led up to it?
It has been a long-time desire of mine to try using the aspects of writing that are deemed flaws — by accepted grammatical and structural norms — as tools to create literature. I explored some of these techniques in this novel. It occurred to me that they would suit its style. Literature is something that transcends norm and form, isn’t it?

Do you feel that there is a change in the censorship mindset in India for better or worse? How does one find the strength to continue to tell relevant stories?
The censorship mindset in India is only getting more stringent. The arenas in which man’s life play out are expanding, and yet our perspectives are growing narrower. The reason for this is that, from the lowest to the highest positions of command, everyone wants to exert one’s authority. Will we ever see a time when people understand that peace can only last without authoritarianism?
How important are awards and nominations to you?
They are not important. There is no need for a writer to think about awards.

What is your writing process like?
I need complete isolation when I’m writing. Words, food and sleep are my only voluntary indulgences at this time. I listen to a bit of music. I need coffee often. That’s about all.

Did you have an ideal reader in mind when you wrote Estuary? Because of a dearth of descriptors, it is easy to imagine yourself as an asura in certain actions of the characters in the book. Was that the purpose?
I don’t think about readers at all when I’m writing. It is only after I finish the first draft that I sit back and wonder what readers will make of it. While revising my subsequent drafts, I do a few things keeping the reader in mind.
It remains for me to expand the world of asuras in my future writing. I plan to save my descriptors for those books. As far as this novel was concerned, I felt names were about enough.

Have English translations of your book affected your writing journey beyond the broadening of an audience base?
My novels were written without any thought of an English readership. It was some years after they were published in Tamil that they were translated into English and other languages. Now, Poonachi and Estuary have been translated almost immediately after release. My experience has been that as long as I create a novel to my satisfaction in my language, it will hold its own in any language. And so I don’t write with the prospect of translation in mind at all. It does give me great joy that my readership has expanded thanks to translation. What drew you towards translations and Murugan?
I guess it is my love of languages that drew me towards translation. Several of my favourite writers including Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Milan Kundera, Jorge Luis Borges, Tahar Ben Jelloun, Banaphool, Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Orhan Pamuk and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn were initially accessible to me only through translation, and I think it is a very crucial and sadly neglected aspect of world literature. My first stint with translation from Tamil was when I wrote a profile of the poet Salma for Fountain Ink magazine. I felt the existing translations of her work didn’t do the original justice and asked permission to translate excerpts myself to go with the profile. Her publisher Kannan Sundaram is also Professor Murugan’s publisher, and he asked me if I’d like to translate him.

Do you feel the landscape of literature in regional languages is changing?
We won’t know much about non-English Indian literature unless translations are commissioned regularly. We have the impression that “regional literature” is playing catch-up with writing in English. But there have been searing works across languages. I often say we’ll never know how many Vikram Seths or V.S. Naipauls exist in other languages unless publishers decide to invest in careful translations. Has anything like Aranyak or Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal been written in English?

Since this was your first translation, how was the experience?
It’s interesting how someone else’s characters can become one’s own when their thoughts are metamorphosed into another language. I felt myself becoming protective of the characters, the story, and the author himself. Reading the novel so many times, both in the original and while reworking my drafts, I saw just how layered it was, and it made me think about how much we miss on a first read.

What were the most difficult as well as the best parts of the translation process of Estuary?
I think the best part was discovering just how beautifully Perumal Murugan, who is one of my favourite writers, has evolved after he has placed certain restrictions on himself. He hasn’t tackled social issues head-on in this novel, but worked them into its fabric — just as they are constant motifs in the fabric of our lives. In that sense, it is his most mature novel. And the responsibility of translating something so precious was huge. The translator in me was under a lot of pressure from the reader and critic in me.

What can we expect next from your table?
I’ve been working on a novel in which I’ve tried to mix various media — graphic novel, music, playwriting, poetry and narrative. I hope that will see the light of the day next.

"Kritika Pandey, winner of the 2020 Commonwealth Short Story prize, on her winning entry the Great Indian Tee And Snakes"," Jharkhand girl Kritika Pandey, a Pushcart-nominated writer and a graduate of the MFA for Poets and Writers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, brought pride for every literature lover by winning the overall 2020 Commonwealth Short Story Prize for her short story The Great Indian Tee and Snakes. The Short Story prize recognises the best unpublished as well as translated work of short fiction in the Commonwealth.
Kritika is a recipient of a 2020 grant from the Elizabeth George Foundation, and has also won the 2020 James W. Foley Memorial Award, the 2018 Harvey Swados Fiction Prize, the 2018 Cara Parravani Memorial Award in Fiction, and a 2014 Charles Wallace India Trust Scholarship for Creative Writing at the University of Edinburgh. Her writings have been published in Granta, The Common, The Bombay Literary Magazine, Raleigh Review, and UCity Review, to name a few.
We caught up with the 29-year-old nonconformist, activist and self-confessed biggest fan of Clarice Lispector and Manto, for a chat about, but not limited to, the telling, kaleidoscopic story of love between ‘the boy in the white skull cap and the girl with the black bindi’, who are caught in the barbed wires of gender, religion, class, culture, caste and more in The Great Indian Tee and Snakes. Excerpts.

How do you contemplate the kinds of entries pooled in for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize over the years?
Well, a lot of the countries in the Commonwealth have old established traditions of oral storytelling that have community engagement, and not as much of Western-centric, written storytelling, but I grew up in the context where written storytelling traditions were most important.
Having said that, among the entries that come in for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, I’ve read many beautiful stories from the Caribbean writers, such as the The Sweet Sop by the Trinidadian writer Ingrid Persaud and Kevin Jared Hosein’s Passage. So, I was very fascinated and impressed by this short story competition that is actively looking to highlight the diversity within the English-speaking world, such as the unique English used by the people of the Caribbean, because their English is not the English of the British people.  
I also remember reading the entry Radio Story by Anushka Jasraj in the magazine Granta. It’s still a rare phenomenon for people from the Global South to think that yes I belong to one of these stories — Anushka’s story did that to me and I felt like okay, this is where I can also participate.

How do you read your winning story, The Great Indian Tee and Snakes, yourself?

This is a story of love but not necessarily a love story as it explores the relationship between a young girl and boy in the context of Indian society, wherein mostly, they hardly get to talk to each other. It’s also about the girl’s interiority and her experience of moving through the world in a female body.  
I wrote from the third-person point of view, which is not omniscient (and no point of view is omniscient), because I was writing about a working-class girl, about whom I don’t know almost anything at all, so it’s my understanding of what her world could possibly look like. There’s a race element to the story. And there’s also the image of the face of the new prime minister looming large everywhere, which I have self-consciously tried to make very Orwellian—people popping up everywhere, wearing masks of his face with tiny holes for eyes, which is actually quite creepy! (Laughs)

How do you pick the subjects and characters of your stories and what is your writing process like?
For this story, there was a spate of disturbing incidents of mob lynching in Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in the background that I was hearing about. But, in 2018, Junaid, who was of my brother’s age, was stabbed in a train and then, Tabrez Ansari, the 24-year old young man was lynched very close to my house. I knew then that this was when a storyteller had to say something through art and it had to be me at that point because I am from Jharkhand.
The image of the girl sitting on a park bench came to me first; a girl trying to fall in love because a guy she loves, she cannot be with for various reasons — as if love was a physiological process that you could will yourself to. I still don’t know how I write what I write, but I don’t solely rely on inspiration. If you are an artist in a capitalist world, you cannot rely on inspiration, that’s such a pretentious approach to your art. So, I write every single day whether or not I’m inspired. If it’s not working, I’ll edit, I’ll re-edit and revise to get to that stage.

How would you position yourself as a postcolonial, Hinglish writer?
When I told my father that I wanted to become a writer, I was not thinking in terms of positioning myself, but to do what I want to do, and what I do best. Hopefully, sooner than later, there will be more writers from the small towns and cities in India who represent a whole new reality which has not been represented yet in the English Indian writing, who will write in English but not about the metropolitan cities. I don’t belong with the south Delhi, south Bombay writers because there’s an immense social capital for writers and artists from those places, and it’s easier for them to break glass ceilings that I had to break all on my own.
There’s this oft-used phrase in the West — ‘diversity among diverse communities ’— you can feel the culture shock when you go from
Ranchi to Delhi; people look at you like ‘wow, she’s talking in English and listening to Pink Floyd and she’s from Ranchi’. Such experiences unsettled me, I decided that I’m going to be very unabashedly from Ranchi, from Jharkhand because there are so many people living in rural Jharkhand who are going through struggles, fighting their battles, something that has not been amply represented in pop culture. So who is going to write the literature that represents them? If I have the privilege to do it, I will do it.

How do you negotiate the multi-layered context of your stories for global readership?
In The Great Indian Tee and Snakes, I included Beyonce to make it a global story, because there are global elements to the local life of people in Jharkhand — people from small towns in India are aware of her and the popular icon that she is, and so are my global readers including my friends in Rwanda, or in Chile or Argentina, and my friends in the global North. They all will read this story and will say that it’s adorable that this girl wants to be like Beyonce!
When I was in a potluck in the US, I took mini samosas with some dhania chutney and my friend from Rwanda picked one and identified it accurately, making me realise that samosas have a more global appeal than the other Indian snacks, and I put them in the story. These are some of the decisions that you have to make in order to make your story more global.

Looking for a staycation to cope with the times? Lose yourself in the luxury and tranquility of the Rajbari Bawali," Spending the last few months sighing every time you scour through your phone gallery and glimpse pictures of holidays past? Are you vicariously ‘travelling’ the world through the films and shows that are available at the click of a button? And are you simply tired of hashtagging your old photos as #throwback and not having the option to add new ones?
That’s exactly how I felt. Until about a week ago. And then I visited The Rajbari Bawali, traipsing back with memories stuffed in my head and many more pictures stuffed in my phone. Most importantly, I felt safe as I soaked in the experience of spending a day at the property. Which is exactly what we are all looking for in these trying times where ‘social distancing’ and ‘new normal’ have made their way, albeit grudgingly, into our vocabulary. About an hour’s drive, give or take a few minutes, out of the city, the 300-year-old boutique heritage hotel that’s now been beautifully restored and yet retains its old-world charm and edifice, is not only sprawling enough (it’s about 4.5 acres) to come with the default setting of social distancing, but has also reset its safety game (staff members duly masked, sanitisers placed at vantage points, consistent sanitisation of the premises, among others) to ensure that one feels extremely safe on its premises, even as you lie back and enjoy the experience that The Rajbari Bawali, aptly tagged as ‘Inspired Heritage’, promises. “The open space, the greenery, the fact that we don’t have any centralised air-conditioning and no wall-to-wall carpets automatically ensure safety and social distancing,” said owner Ajay Rawla, who chanced upon the property, then in a state of ruin, about nine years ago, and has painstakingly and lovingly restored it inch by inch to make The Rajbari Bawali the luxurious space it is today. If not anything else, the fact that the latest Netflix breakout hit Bulbbul, with the cast and crew, including its producer Anushka Sharma, firmly parking themselves at the property for a few weeks, was almost wholly shot at The Rajbari Bawali, should definitely make you plan a trip.
With its discerningly picked-up bric-a-brac, spacious rooms and suites boasting traditional four-poster beds, charming chaise lounges and regal artefacts, every corner of The Rajbari Bawali speaks a story. That’s what I discovered as I spent the day exploring the property (a day simply isn’t enough, I must admit), loving it at first glance and losing myself in a bespoke experience that combines the region’s traditional customs, art forms and cuisine. Yes, I could barely move after a I-have-lost-count-of-the-number-of-courses authentic Bengali lunch. Boasting a wide range of rooms — from ‘Classic Heritage’ to ‘Royal Suite’ to ‘Zamindari’ — The Rajbari Bawali has a wide range of options to choose from, each an experience in itself. The annexe spaces of ‘Notun Bari’, ‘Chhoto Bari’, ‘Ashram’ and ‘Dak Bunglow’ ensure that even when it’s booked to capacity, the property allows you your own space.
“If families come with their kids, they can comfortably take up two rooms at the Notun Bari that are away from the main building... we can even serve their meals there. The Chhoto Bari has five rooms... groups of friends and families can come together, and we can give them a separate dining space,” said Rawla, reiterating the property’s emphasis on making its guests feel safe in the middle of a raging pandemic.
What you well and truly need to know — there are some special room rates lined up for this season.
Facilities at The Rajbari Bawali include a conference room, restaurants, library, a snooker room and a large sit-out area that’s perfect for marriages and gatherings. The property also houses a swimming pool and a spa, which, understandably, is not being made available at the time, keeping safety in mind.
My personal favourite was the cafe space on the terrace, that Rawla aptly described as ‘by the stars’, that looks stunning by the night and made me sit back and drink in its beauty and tranquility as I lazily sipped on my drink. And after months of being holed up indoors, a walk through the verdant greens of the property actually made me feel like a kid in a candy shop and a little more appreciative of what nature offers us.
A stay at The Rajbari Bawali doesn’t just limit you to the property. A guided walk through the village, a visit to the local temples as well as the horticulture belt of Muchisa in the vicinity can be on the cards when you visit. Come late afternoon, I found myself on a sundowner country boat river cruise, where I not only took in the beauty of a jaw-dropping sunset sailing on the waters of the Hooghly, but was also regaled by some splendid music, both old and new, belted out by a pair of musicians. Once back at The Rajbari Bawali, I witnessed the ‘sandhya aarti’, a transportative experience, rendered authentic by its scene and setting, .
Looking for some more reasons to drive down to The Rajbari Bawali this weekend? Well, how about staring at the open skies (a luxury in the times we live in) while sipping on a gin and tonic? That sealed the deal, didn’t it? Address: The Rajbari Bawali, PS, Rajbari, Bawali, Nodakhali, West Bengal 700137

Lawyer-turned-singer Aditi Ramesh makes a case for her music," How are you spending the lockdown days? Have you discovered a new creative side to you?
I’ve been spending my time teaching online, practising, creating new music, cooking and doing house work. I’ve started doing background scores more in this lockdown than before and I’m really enjoying the process. I’m also experimenting with different styles of music and singing in different languages, like Tamil, Hindi and Bengali.  

What are you teaching online?
I teach Western vocals, Carnatic vocals and their theory to groups as well as one-on-one. I like introducing both styles to all my students, regardless of what their main subject matter is.

You seem to go live quite often. Does that help you stay in touch with your audience?
In April I did three live stream concerts and one live session, making chutney. It was a nice way to connect with my audience at a time when they can’t watch me perform on stage. However, of late, I’ve been focusing more on my classes and composing new music. The online gig format is a great way the industry is adapting but I feel it should not be overused. I will be doing a live stream show with House Concert India in August. I’ve done live performances with House Concert before.

Now that you have some spare time, have you made any new music?
I released Heal in May and I’ve been working on a few English singles as well as some music in Tamil. Each of these songs has a different style and is also a bit different from my earlier work.

You were on the cover of ‘Women of Indie India’ playlist on Spotify. What was your reaction?
It was quite unbelievable to see my face on the cover of this playlist. The past three years have been filled with hard work and a lot of performance on different stages throughout India and even abroad. When I first started out in March 2017, I didn’t know a thing about the industry, what is required of an artiste. I have learned so much in three years.

You strongly feel and talk about equality for woman...
Absolutely! There has been a historical societal difference between men and women and a lot of aggression and frustration associated with it from both sides. For anything to really change a strong force or push is required. In the field of music, I’ve seen over the past few years that the number of strong female performers and bandleaders performing original music has grown a lot. I think it’s important for more women musicians, vocalists and instrumentalists to put themselves out there boldly because these only encourages more women to do the same and removes the novelty attached to female musicians.

Tell us a little about ‘Reboot Sessions With Aditi’.
The Reboot Sessions was an initiative by Dreambird Records, founded by Mumbai-based vocalist Ananya Sharma from the band Queendom. I had the pleasure of working with them. She curated an amazing list of musicians, vocalists and producers to conduct specialised masterclasses on various topics. All of the money that was raised from these classes went towards providing food and rations to the underprivileged and migrant workers in Bombay whose livelihood has been impacted by Covid. I covered the Carnatic note system besides how to arrange music around your melody as a vocalist in my session.

You have collaborated with Tre Ess (a producer and MC from Ranchi) for Heal. How was the collaboration?
The collaboration with Tre Ess was organic and smooth. He’s very easy to work with and he takes feedback of any sort really well. This was a song which was conceived and recorded in just three or four days but we sat for a few weeks on the finer details before releasing it. The message of the song is important. In these uncertain times we all feel anxious and low at times, but its impact is far worse on the less privileged. We should take joy in the small things we had all along and be grateful for what we have. We should reconsider our lifestyle choices and how they impact the environment even beyond the pandemic.

Your dream collaboration would be?
Ilaiyaraaja, A.R. Rahman, Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, The Roots, Tom Misch, Tigran Hamasyan, Childish Gambino, Nai Palm, Solange, I could go on and on… (laugh).

You have also raised funds for migrant workers during the lockdown. Tell us about that.
Migrant workers are the worst hit. We are all facing hardship in terms of income, work flow and survival but we can’t imagine what migrant and daily wage workers are going through. I try to support causes that help them, which can involve performing on live streams to raise funds or create awareness about their plight.

You grew up in Buffalo, New York. Were you into music then? How was childhood like?
As a child I learned Carnatic vocals and Western classical piano. My training began there but I was too young to have an artistic voice. My childhood was wrought with being confused about my identity and resisting my cultural roots. I think moving back to India was one of the best decisions my parents made.

When did you move to India? How was Bangalore for you?
I moved to Bangalore when I was 15. Bangalore was a lovely, green and peaceful place to grow up in. I also owe so much to my teachers at Mallya Aditi International School for nurturing all of us and guiding our thought and expression.

Were you into music after you moved here?
I always loved music but I was not seriously into music after moving here. I learned Carnatic vocals after moving to Bangalore for some years and sang in school functions from time to time but I slowly lost touch with it over the years and stopped practising. In college I used to sing once a year at our college fest but then again I never practised. I started getting back to it after working as a lawyer in Bombay for two years and getting frustrated with it.

What made you study law? If not music, would Aditi be a lawyer?
My principal in school, Sathish Jayarajan, was a big influence on me as a child and he also taught us political science in Class XI and XII. I enjoyed all his classes and that inspired me to take up law. If I were not a musician I don’t think I would’ve continued to be a corporate lawyer but I may have drawn on my love for music and art and done something with intellectual property law as this subject always fascinated me.

When did you start writing your music?
I’ve written a few embarrassing love songs as a 13-year-old, I don’t count those though (laugh). I wrote a few songs when I was a lawyer so I’d say that’s when I started looking at songwriting. Efflux of Time is the first song I ever recorded and released and I count it as my first original song.

How do you approach your songwriting? Any theme that dominates while writing?
Each song has its process, at times the chords come first and at times the vocal melody comes first. What I think dominates my writing right now and drives the pieces is lyrics.

Tell us about Autocorrect, the EP.
Autocorrect is still very special to me. It was my first EP, first proper recording sessions, the first time working with a band and the first time learning what mixing and mastering is and how the entire recording process works. The themes of the songs are everyday problems, so the title Autocorrect. Till date Efflux of Time and Marriageable Age are crowd favourites whenever we perform.   Who is your inspiration?
Etta James, MS Subbulakshmi, Mahalia Jackson, Anita O’ Day, DK Pattammal, Parveen Sultana .... Basically strong women from different ages and cultural backgrounds who have boldly put their music out in the way that they wanted to.

How did Ladies Compartment come about? When and how do you guys jam now? Virtually?
Ladies Compartment was the first project I put together after quitting law. Initially it was Nandita our bassist, Kirsten the violinist who was in India for a short period, and I. After she returned to the US I had put out a post calling for women musicians. Ramya, our guitarist, and Aarifah, our drummer, joined in. Right now jamming is hard, you can’t really jam online. But we will be virtually working on a video or two soon.

For young people who want to be musicians, what is the one thing you would tell them to do?
Don’t be afraid to have a day job when you start out. I think it helps as a new artiste to not depend on your art alone for money, so that you have the freedom to explore and find your voice and musicality as an artist. Also it’s very important to be disciplined and organised about your practice and general living routines. Lastly, you must get rid of any ego you have, it has no place in your artistic development. It’s easy to get carried away with social media in today’s age but be aware that it is a tool that you’ll use strategically, but it is not everything, or even anything really.",culture
A bunch of achievers from various walks of life talk about their quarantine discoveries," I have discovered yoga. I had never done yoga in my life and had been hearing about it and also wanted to practise it. I am doing it with a group of friends and feeling flexible and strong at the core. Pranayama was so relaxing. It has been quite a good experience for me. Along with that I have been exercising too. Previously, I was being quite lazy and not working out. So, with yoga and workout, I have managed to get back into shape in terms of losing a bit of weight.
The other very important thing is I have gone back to grandmothers’ recipes, like having milk with turmeric at night, a bit of ginger in a cup of hot tea in the morning and honey with lemon. It was a part of our childhood and we had lost out on it in the middle. Yes, I have been watching a lot of films, reading books, dancing a lot in front of the mirror, which I used to miss, but the biggest rediscovery has been the family time. I hadn’t had the chance to spend so much time with my family in the last 10-14 years. I bonded with my parents and my brother once again. We did everything together. We would suddenly come up with ideas. The amazing bit was we were all together. That was fun. I have always loved my own space and respected others’ spaces too. Everybody should have their own space even in the same family, but we became engrossed in that. I am loving this togetherness. The last time I had spent such a time was probably in school or college. When you step into a professional field, life changes. When I was promoting Bulbbul (web film) or Kaali (web series), I was working from home. I knew I had half-an-hour or a one-hour break for lunch or I would get some time for coffee. That gave me a school-like feeling. Porikhha’r shomoi jaate porikhha bhalo hoi, my mother used to make yummy food. The family space where there is respect, love and mutual understanding of each other’s preferences is what I loved.
Aamra toh onek boro boro bishoi niye bhabi and we want to do something about those. This (pandemic) brought back the smaller joys of life. We obviously care for our family and friends, but sharing became important. It’s not only about what I want to do, but also about the others in the family… what do they like. When I watch a film alone, it’s my choice, but when I am watching it with my brother, it’s an unanimous choice. Oi jinish gulo chole gechhilo. I was constantly travelling for work and the regular life had become individual oriented. I have been able to come out of it and I am enjoying this space of doing things together.
Every evening my mom rehearses. She loves singing and I accompany her sometimes. Maane, aamai jor korei korate hoi (laughs)! That’s another thing that I have rediscovered about myself! I have become more lazy and laid-back. That’s very Bong! (Laughs) I have connected with my roots once again.

I really wanted to indulge in miniature gardening, but since we were not going out and in our building there are a lot of senior citizens and nothing from outside was allowed, I couldn’t order online too. I am yet to procure the materials, but I will do it. I’ve discovered that you don’t need to iron tablecloths. Just put them on the table while they’re wet but after a good wringing, smoothen them down and turn in the fan. They dry absolutely flat and creaseless. I’ve discovered I am capable of writing 4,000 words a day and finishing a novel in four-and-a-half months. I’ve rediscovered Annihilation of Caste and the poetry of Vikram Seth. I’ve discovered all kinds of random stuff in the bottom drawers and top shelves in my house that had been lurking there for years. I’ve discovered that I am capable of killing a big scorpion but not a small snake. I really like The Chriselle Factor (a blog ). Chriselle Lim has always been someone I have loved to follow not just for fashion but also her approach towards life and what she has been able to achieve with her career and her blog. It’s so informative and all her stories and articles are always an interesting read.
Melissa Wood Health is a mindfulness and wellness coach and her talks and her blog has really helped me get through my time well in quarantine. She has the most insightful ways of looking at life. I think most importantly, I found myself. I run a fairly large business and I have an aged mother and I have my stores. So, I find that I am forever taking care of other things and other people. (This period has been) about the foods I love to eat and not just baking a cake because there is flour in the house, and the shows I like to watch.
I come back home from work quite late and then whatever my servant has made is in front of me. I don’t have the patience to tell them what to cook every day. So, I basically eat whatever is served to me. Most men do that! They know my favourites. I need a dal, a sabji....
I learnt how to cook which many people have learnt, but I have learnt to cook things I want to eat. I love fish but I am such a novice at cooking that I wouldn’t know where to start. I started seeing a lot of YouTube videos and having a lot of phone conversations with my younger sister who has been living in Calcutta for 25 years. I told her she has to teach me how to make different kinds of fish... with mustard sauce, vegetables, lemon and garlic... how to marinate it and learning what fish is good for what kind of cooking. I learnt to pamper myself a little bit.
I was really lagging behind with some of the most iconic Indian movies and television shows. I think I literally must be the last person in India who has seen Gangs of Wasseypur 1, 2 and 3. I also loved watching Sacred Games, Mirzapur, Gurgaon, Paatal Lok. I didn’t realise that there is such great content being produced by these alternative directors and actors. Loved it! For me it’s been a very reflective period. I felt myself going very internal. Of course, I have been doing things on and off. The family was with me partially. Ira (daughter) was with me for three-four weeks and Neha (daughter) came with her daughter. She is still with me. I am madly in love with my two granddaughters!
It came to me that there isn’t really much theatre that I will be able to do, but, I didn’t let myself get hassled. I am not feeling anxious or insecure at all. This is what it is and the best way to deal with it is to just be calm. It’s true that I need the money, but what will be will be.
We will evolve. I am also not getting angsty that I must go online. Organically I’ll know what to do. I don’t think we will go back to the same world as pre-Covid and that has its own ramifications. It has thrown so many questions at us and those are the real findings. They are in the emotional sphere.
Life is very uncertain. I have always felt it and this (the pandemic) markedly made it clear to me and underlined the thought that you just have to be in the moment. This is my philosophy if you know me.
HarperCollins had been calling me since April last year to write. Finally, around April this year I buckled down and said ‘why not’? I have always wanted to do something else. I like writing, so, why not explore this aspect of myself. I am writing a memoir.",culture
"Girish Pradhan and Chris Adler join forces with new project, FirstBorne"," How often does one get to live their dream of performing with their favourite musician? For Girish Pradhan of Girish and The Chronicles, it
was a dream come true. The Bangalore-based musician has teamed up with former Lamb of God and Megadeth drummer Chris Adler with their new venture, FirstBorne. The heavy metal band also includes former bassist of Megadeth James LoMenzo and Myrone on guitar. The band launched their first self-titled EP on June 19, which was also the date that Lamb of God released their self-titled album. Hmm!
The Telegraph caught up with Girish for a quick chat.

Chris Adler and you got together for a workshop last year but how did FirstBorne come about?
During our performance in Bangalore with Chris Adler last year, after the show and at times during rehearsals he made me listen to this new project that he has been working on. He told me he was collaborating with friends and mentioned that it was Myrone (on guitar) and James LoMenzo (on bass). Then he asked me if I was interested to try-out. I said: “Sure, of course.” I went home and I started recording some takes on it. Seems like they really liked it! After our show in Hyderabad he sent me a text message and then added me to a group. Then we started talking and recording more songs… it was a fun thing in the beginning when we were trying to see where it goes. We actually have recorded a lot of songs but have just released five. Would you say that you’re living the rock star dream, playing with musicians you listened to and seen live?
Oh yeah, that’s for sure because I really jumped up in joy when he told me he wanted me to try that track out (laughs). Of course, he was a legend from Lamb of God but at the same time, I was really drawn towards his work on the Dystopia album by Megadeth. I’ve been a huge Megadeth fan all my life and I actually sung some of Megadeath’s songs in shows last year. Now, here is the real person playing that song, like wow (laughs)!

Why call yourselves FirstBorne?
We were discussing it and… well I’m just confused as to how this started (laughs). Maybe it’s something about him (Chris Adler) coming from a very groove metal kind of a background and me being from a hard rock, heavy metal, glam metal background. Myrone has his own genre. So FirstBorne was a good suggestion by Chris and it’s a ‘firstborn’ thing for us to venture into because we’ve never done this kind of stuff before. How long did you work on your first EP?
It started in November (last year). We had been working on a few demos but those songs are not finalised; we had just recorded them. It was in the last three or four months we got the idea about spreading positivity, spreading messages. Primordial is about how even though we are in this huge crisis, it’s a good chance for humanity to realise its mistake. The question asked in the song: “Are we really going to change? Is this going to bring about a change?” Our other song is called Anthem, which is about the chaos that was happening in our country before Covid-19. Everything was chaotic and I tried to convey a message saying that this has to stop right now and in the end, it’s the common people who have to come first.

With the lockdown keeping everyone indoors, how do you plan to work on your upcoming music?
Right now we share files, we send recordings and ideas to one another, we do video calls, Zoom calls, WhatsApp… we share everything we have in our mind, like a new idea for a song. And then we work and discuss it… it’s all pretty virtual.

What are these recording and files you’re working on virtually?
We already have a bank of another three or four songs plus a few more demos. We’re still working on some songwriting. So it’s coming up and we are going to release a lyric video for Roll The Dice on our YouTube channel. But our main focus right now is these five songs and then we’ll head to the next chapter.
  Hunter Hunted: It is about being a prisoner of your own. You might have this grudge or enmity with someone, or an archenemy. Many thoughts haunt you every day, so it’s a battle going on in the mind.
Roll The Dice: It’s actually death or a similar entity talking to you. The lyrics are about how no matter what you do, death is inevitable. It also represents this strength we have inside to survive.
Apocalypse: It is like an aftermath of a war or something like it. Like in The Terminator there is a future… where everything is over and people are trying to survive. The song is about a similar situation but more related to stuff like pollution and now there is a small group of people confined underground and they can’t go out.",culture
Anavila Misra on her Rakhi initiatives and the importance of investing in relationships and slowing down," As a kid, fashion designer Anavila Misra always “prayed” for a brother. And from the day he arrived eight years after her, till today, he remains her baby brother. “It was the most exciting thing in our lives,” says Anavila, the eldest of the three siblings. Her sister is her “closest in the entire world”, her “best friend and companion”. “I had an absolutely wonderful childhood,” she recollects to The Telegraph. This Rakhi, her Delhi-based sister and Gurgaon-based brother will meet up and Anavila, who is in Mumbai, will connect virtually. “My sister will tie him a rakhi from my side,” she says. A perfect epilogue perhaps to the Rakhi initiative that Anavila has been spearheading to help in picking that perfect sari for your sister.

This is such a heart-warming initiative...
This whole thing came about with Rakhi approaching. We have a lot of women artisans who work at our Gurgaon unit. Work in the last two months has been quite sporadic. We opened slowly with a few people returning to work. These women are very good with their handwork. We have always collected the leftovers from our productions and have been making accessories. So we decided to make rakhis as a trial. We just wanted to see how it looks because we have never done this before. You also want to fill in some enthusiasm in the team. We made a few and they looked so nice! It was just to create that momentum, that freshness with a product which was a natural extension because you are still working with fabrics and textiles and do all the details that we do on our garments like delicate sequins work somewhere or a bit of embroidery and threadwork. We have made hundreds of rakhis in the last few weeks. In India we are even sending all the Puja material which is not being sent abroad because of the customs problem. We are sending akshat, roli, mishri, laung, elaichi to make it special. The wraps made for the rakhis are also linen wraps. This is also a time when the brothers buy gifts for their sisters. Now that everything is happening online, we had a meeting with all my team members and we understood that it is difficult for men to decide how to buy a sari because they have no clue (laughs). So, we thought of navigating them through our collection in a way which helps them to make that decision. We decided on three broad questions, not difficult, which will help them choose a sari with confidence that they are making the correct choice. That’s how we segregated the entire range.

Ads by Teads
We have a lot of guys in the team, my husband, brother, a select group of clients whose husbands could pitch in. We did a survey with them before arriving at the questions. The first question is, ‘Does your sister have a big frame or a small frame?’ I have a very small frame... just 5’2”. So, I always consider the borders I am wearing. A strong, big border cuts into your frame. If it is a very big check, it gets lost on my body. Then ‘does she like spending time in nature if she has free time or would she rather spend it with her gadgets?’ If I am a nature-loving person, then I’ll drift towards more natural hues or motifs. And, the third one was ‘whether she likes to style herself traditionally or is she a bohemian, contemporary kind of a person?’ When you answer these, you go to a set of saris.
We haven’t limited it to the boys. Some of us are only two sisters and the bond is as strong. Though this festival has been built around a brother-sister relationship, that was more to do with olden times when men were considered to be the one with muscular strength. Very different times altogether to live in. The whole thing of security and protection were different from what it is now. Today it’s more about emotions, being there, navigating through difficult times and not so much about physically coming and helping someone. We have spoken about the sisterly love and sisterhood in our campaign, which was a very important part and in fact, a few enquiries have come from women to send a sari to their sister, which is so beautiful. They are all linen saris and some of them are with zari but predominantly the warp is linen in everything. We have hand-block prints and a few jamdanis. We are valuing relationships more than ever before. How are you viewing relationships?
I have always been quite a private person. I don’t socialise much or go out much. I have a select circle in which I move and I am very close to my family. We talk every day, be it my sister, brother or parents. This (the pandemic) has only brought us closer and you feel it is the strength of your family and friends which can take you through any difficult time. It is about investing in relationships.
I was in the hospital last to last week for a surgery. We are not calling our house help right now and my husband and son have been managing everything. Our family can’t travel now, but our friend circle has stood by us. I feel I am very blessed.
On the work front, we didn’t work for two months at all, but we were constantly in touch with everyone. A group of embroiderers live very close to each other in Bihar. They didn’t want to come right now, but obviously everyone wants work. To help them, we have established a chhota sa karkhana in one of the villages. See, this is the bond they have among themselves. You have to be emotionally present for each other. It’s been a hand-holding experience.
How have you adapted to the halt?
Initially you were struggling to understand ke abhi yeh kar lete hai, woh kar lete hai.... I have been enjoying my house and space. There is a new kind of understanding of your kitchen and home from a place where you just come to rest. It’s what it should be from the very start... to rediscover my own space and to be able to create every corner the way it should be. I have found this new love for food. I have a 13-year-old son, going to 14, and he is a hungry caterpillar! (Laughs) And, you know how boys are at this age. Dal, roti and chawal will not work all the time. How do you cook new things which are exciting for him  in between the dal, roti and chawal? It’s been a nice time just doing that and seeing how nutrition can go into every meal that you are cooking for him. It’s been a time of self-discovery and understanding your own life and space in a much better way.

You have been championing sustainable clothing for long and it’s so relevant now...
Everything comes around in its natural cycle. May be it was something like this which could have shaken us up. For me also, I have been so busy with travelling and work and then I understand life in a different way. Your house is where you get all your energy from. It heals you.
When I go to the villages, for example, that West Bengal village where I lived with my weavers for four days, to just go through their lives and lifestyles... how it is built around what they have. Now things are changing in villages also, but nine years ago, it was about accommodating. That’s why there is another kind of calm. They live with the rhythm of nature.We want this also and that also, disrupting the system and living in a certain way. In the last three-four months, there has been a huge acknowledgement for the rhythm of nature and how we can take this forward. Koi zaroorat nahin hai bhaag dour ki (laughs). You suddenly understand that you could do so many things at a slower pace.
For fashion it has been an important learning. One season after another. Seasons between seasons. My spring/summer was made in March. We just launched it and went into a shutdown. I am not scared because my collection doesn’t lose any relevance. The customer is looking for something new because they are exposed to something new every second day. If you launch something today, it will be old tomorrow. I feel that is something which will change and should change and we should not go back to what we were (laughs).

Is there anything that was a part of your life pre-Covid that will definitely not make a comeback, come what may?
Sleep has been an issue with me. Once you have kids... and my husband has been in a travelling job... what you do is, you start giving your time in pockets. You work the whole day. Then your son comes home and you spend time with him and feed him and then you find your time in the night somewhere. I had started getting that time of just being with myself or work on new ideas, late in the night, and that became a habit, a bad one.
I have been reading about wellness and food. The initial three hours of our sleep is when our body is recouping. I wasn’t getting that sleep. I wasn’t even sleeping between 10.30pm and midnight. That leads to a lot of stress and you might not understand, but your body might be living with it. I am working on being able to sleep on time and wake up on time. And, to be present in the moment. To not waste time and delay things. By doing that, you have so much time on your hands to enjoy life in a different way.
  Little Women: The sisters and the mother go through ups and downs but they are close to each other and hold each other in difficult times. It is a beautiful book and movie.
Anne of Green Gables: How Anne become a part of lives of the brother and the sister and how she becomes their own kin. How she experiences love, warmth and protection being an orphan, has been beautifully portrayed. I also loved its Canadian adaptation, Anne with an E (on Netflix).
Beautiful Boy: It is a little dark, about drug abuse and how the father is trying to take the son out of it. It beautifully shows the emotions between a father and a son.",culture
Breakfast truly is a standout meal — Lockdown realisation of a millennial," Breakfast is that meal of the day which many of us millennials consume half-asleep, lazily in our pyjamas just out of bed or sometimes, even in bed. For some, it is just a quick bite while rushing out of the house in the morning. Often, a cup of piping hot tea or strong coffee. Breakfast doesn’t quite sound like the usual routine for many of us. We often tend to ‘break our fast’ with what sounds like a word straight out of a millennial’s handbook — brunch.
The sudden pandemic resulting in the prolonged state of lockdown has changed the lives of millennials in significant ways. While for many life has turned completely upside down, for some the order of things has just fallen back into place. Life and the pace with which it moves has suddenly slowed down. With extra time in hand, there’s a whole new appreciation for simple things in life. There are realisations and a better understanding of everyday things, like breakfast — the whys and whats, the confounding history, meandering trajectory and varied preparations.
“Breakfast is the most important meal of the day”— is a familiar statement yet I never understood its importance until a few days into the lockdown, when I spent some time in preparing a hearty bowl of breakfast that came with a surprising increase in energy levels and a lift in the spirit. The curiosity was further quenched by stumbling upon the surprisingly strange history of breakfast.

The History and Trajectory
ADVERTISING
Ads by Teads
Breakfast wasn’t conceptually so at its outset. The concept developed over the years in Europe and then America specifically, with the influence of religious didacticism, culture, digestive abilities, physical well-being, lifestyle, and of course, branding and marketing. The labelling of various meals since its inception has a perplexing trajectory too. By tracing the etymology, one can know that the word ‘dinner’ implied ‘break(ing) the fast’. But over the years, dinner has become that meal we consume in the later half of the evening. Breakfast, on the other hand, had always signified the morning meal as we understand it even today.
Coming to the breakfast culture closer home, a typical, traditional Sunday breakfast at any Bengali household would comprise of luchi with chholar dal, a light and aromatic potato curry or kochuri with aloo-r torkari and jilipi.
The cookbook titled Thakurbarir Ranna by Purnima Tagore, on the Tagore family’s culinary traditions, lists a wide variety of food in the ‘jolkhabar’ section that is a clear amalgamation of the traditional and Western influences. It mentions dishes like koraishutir kochuri, chirer polao, upma, ghugni, lauer halua, sujir malpoa, rutir pudding along with dishes like cheese toast and cheese straw. Many of the dishes mentioned here are still popular in a Bangali bari and are consumed as breakfast food regularly.

The Full English Breakfast
Progress towards the Industrial Revolution in England in the 18th century and with facilities of export and import, the breakfast menu for both the elite and the middle class got a luxurious makeover. A separate room was dedicated to the morning meal, called breakfast parlour that signified opulence. According to researchers, the themes of breakfast remain similar globally even today. Think grains, dairy, and protein, alongside a hot beverage. However, it’s safe to say that the menu is and has always been class-specific. Breakfast became an established culinary tradition during the Victorian era with bacon and eggs finding a permanent place on the menu, giving rise to the concept of a ‘full English breakfast’ central to the British national identity. The lavish breakfast menu included eggs, hot cereals, fresh fruits and toast with butter and jam with coffee and tea. The Cereal Invasion
Cereals are the go-to, healthy, easy-to-arrange, quick-meal option that is preferred as a household breakfast food, globally, even now. However, flaked cereals was an “accidental invention” in 1894 by John Harvey Kellogg and his brother Will, yet its marketing was strategically planned giving it the popular status it enjoys till today. It changed the concept of breakfast consumption forever and made it easier and convenient.
Interestingly, the end of the 19th century saw the inclusion of breakfast recipes in cookbooks. Corn-based food gained a certain popularity as breakfast food as it was considered inexpensive and filling. Granola, oats, buttermilk biscuits, and other instant breakfast food started getting popular post-1920s.

Breakfast in the 21st century
Breakfast as a concept often indicates a private affair — the morning meal that one consumes at home. It has often been used in movies to indicate the normalcy of life and routined structure of life. However, with the mushrooming of the cafe culture around the globe pre-pandemic, the concept of ‘breakfast date’ became quite popular with millennials. Even though indulging in breakfast as a part of the routine life became alien to them.
Here’s a look at some popular breakfast dishes from around the world…
India: As is known to all, India’s unity lies in its diversity and it holds true for food as well. In our country, different regions have different breakfast staples. Some of the common breakfast dishes are dosa, idli and upma from the southern parts of India; flat rice with yoghurt, sugar, milk or jaggery from Assam, puri-sabji or luchi, kochuri and torkari or aloo dum or chholar dal from Bengal; puttu made from rice and coconut from Kerala; poha from Madhya Pradesh; stuffed paratha with pickle and butter from Punjab and sattu paratha or sattu litti from Bihar; and thepla from Gujarat.

Malaysia: Nasi lemak is a filling rice-based morning dish prepared with coconut milk, anchovies, peanuts and pandan. With an array of flavours, the dish could contain beef, chicken, spicy shrimp, boiled egg, and cucumber.

Vietnam: Pho is the usual breakfast dish, a noodle soup with meat and veggies that is mildly spicy.

Japan: The elaborate traditional breakfast platter consists of rice, grilled fish, Japanese omelette, miso soup, soybeans, nori and pickled veggies.

Turkey: The sesame-coated Turkish bread, simit, is served with boiled eggs or omelette, cheese, olives, honey, tomatoes, cucumbers and/or fruits along with Turkish coffee or tea. Sometimes spicy sausages are also part of the meal.

Italy and France: Breakfast in Italy and France is simple and mostly contains bakery products. Coffee with sweet-cream, Nutella or chocolate filling croissant (cornetto) is the usual breakfast in Italy. Bread-butter, baguette or pastries with a beverage is common in France.

China and Southeast Asia: Congee is a porridge made of rice served with a wide variety of toppings in various places of Southeast Asia. Dim sums and dough sticks served with soy milk are also popular in China.

Spain and Portugal: Fried doughnut sticks or pastry served with a thick chocolate dip is a popular morning meal in these regions. Toast topped with a spread of grated tomato is also popular in Spain. Milk coffee is popular in Portugal.

USA: Eggs Benedict is a dish preferred all over the US, which had its birth in New York. English muffins, poached eggs, and ham or bacon served with creamy Hollandaise sauce make up this wonderful dish.

Egypt: Ful medames, a stew, is the national breakfast dish of this country, made with fava beans and boiled eggs garnished with parsley.

Brazil: Pao de queijo is the most common breakfast in this region. It is a type of bread cheese served with coffee and ham. Feijoda, a black bean soup with a variety of meat, is also considered a morning dish.

Mexico: Chilaquiles is a popular Mexican breakfast dish made of tortilla, spicy flavoured sauce, cheese, vegetables, and meat. We got in touch with two F&B brands in the city that never lets us down with their breakfast offerings: Flurys and Artsy — Coffee & Culture for, some yummy breakfast recipes.
What Artsy gave us is an open sandwich called South Indian Masala Toast — a sandwich with traditional Indian flavours served on bread — drifting from their typical Indian or Western (European/American) breakfast options.

It helps to start the day on an energetic note,” is the first thing that nutritionist Hena Nafis told us when we asked her about how important breakfast truly is. She further pointed out various benefits of not skipping breakfast. “People who eat breakfast generally have lesser food cravings during the day and won’t binge at irregular hours. Also, having a heavy meal at one go is not right. Breakfast helps to avoid that. It helps to keep blood pressure and blood sugar levels under control. It helps to have a good memory and also keeps us in a better mood. It helps to kick-start metabolism in the morning that usually slows down while sleeping.”
For those who have taken the path of intermittent fasting or often use that as an excuse (guilty as charged!) to not eat in the morning,
Hena has a word of caution. “Intermittent fasting has become a rage now and they say that breakfast is not important. But that functions on a different tangent altogether. The old school did associate breakfast with body weight. But if people binge on food at odd hours then they will get heavier. A proper meal will help them to keep their weight balanced,” said Hena.
Regarding the right time of eating breakfast and the kind of food that one should consume, Hena said, “There is an adage that says, “eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper”. But rather than having a heavy breakfast, it is important to have a nutritious breakfast. Less sugar and less oil would definitely make a healthy breakfast. And the ideal time to have breakfast is within an hour or two after waking up. As far as the food is concerned, it could be anything healthy according to your lifestyle. Need not always be cereal, egg, or toast.”",culture
"Abish Mathew on his new show Son of Abish Season 7, his lockdown routine and why he dreams of being a philosopher"," One of the pioneers of stand-up comedy in India, Abish Mathew is a household name now among GenY with his inimitable style of stage performances interspersed with music, sketches and improvs. The Telegraph catches up with Abish before Son of Abish Season 7 is launched in a home-made avatar soon.

Has it been all work in this lockdown period?
It’s been an introspective time, especially for anyone who’s living alone. It’s been a very creative space. Initially, I created this property called Viva, which is basically an Instagram Live. Now it’s become like a talent show. That is when I thought of why not launch Son of Abish on the digi-platform… if this can work, why not that?! It also tells us so much about this change in user behaviour. Comedians have been doing live events and people want to have these live interactions.

Tell us about how Son of Abish Season 7 is all home-made...
The studio is my living room now. I have moved around all my furniture. I literally have to move everything before I can go out of the door to get groceries.

What about the live audience experience? Is it the best part of it?
My fave thing is to go up on stage. Earlier, we used to get the guests in the studio and shoot. It was easier but the live audience was missing. So now how do we integrate it? What we do is, we get 20/30 people max and for the first 20 minutes we interact with these people. They keep their audio and video on. So 70 per cent of the people are repeat audience. They come sometimes in their pyjamas, with their drinks, sometimes they dress up and then I feel severely underdressed. Last time I put on a jacket after seeing them so well-dressed. It’s like a game show with the audience almost. It’s more interactive than conversational only.

Which platform are you guys working on this season?
We will be uploading it on YouTube but the communication is through Zoom.

Is it also the first full-fledged show done in absolute quarantine?

Yes, it was more exciting than difficult. I have done a lot of back-end work trying to build a company. I was able to pool in people from different fields, so everyone had their designations but everyone had to do everything. All these guys are not technicians but artistes. I have to look into a lot of technical stuff apart from hosting. I have to edit some segments though we have an editor because it’s my idea and someone else might not do a good job. So is there a mix of Indian and international stars this season?
This season, we looked at digi-stars in India. But also some Bolly celebs who are artistic and not just big names. Like for example, we got in touch with the Indian-American actor Utkarsh Ambudkar, who has worked in the film Pitch Perfect (2012) and the TV show The Mindy Project (2013). He’s also a known free-style rapper who performed at the Oscars 2020. Utkarsh will be there with Raftaar — so two hip-hop stars from two different countries. We also got on board Asif Ali, the Indian-American actor who worked in The Mandalorian (2019), the American space Western web television series. Kalki Koechlin will be there as well. Everybody else we are in talks with.

You have worn many masks in your career. Now, you must be wearing a real one. What has the lockdown taught you?
It taught me to buy a washing machine (laughs). I recently learnt cooking. I lost a lot of weight. Cooking, doing dishes, mopping floors and washing clothes can be very meditative because if you are not listening to music and you are cleaning the floor, your brain is thinking of ideas. It’s a great time for ideas to be born. So if you have a creative block, do some home chores.

What’s going to be different this season in terms of content?
What you should be looking out this season is the opening segment with the audience and the section called ‘No Reason At All’, which is an absurd comedy sketch. There’s an entire dedicated team for this part. This time it won’t be about how the celeb became famous or something… this time it’s about what he/she represents and what’s their opinion. Like for example, Utkarsh spoke about the struggles of an Indian-American in America. So we are going deeper instead of going wider.

What do you think the comedy industry needs more than ever now?
Personally, there’s a need to recognise that we are part of something bigger. Poets, storytellers, singers, comedians and dancers… are a part of the performance arts community. In the lockdown, live shows were the first to be affected. So all performing artistes need to bind together now, as a solid voice. We have to create and keep having opinions.

How and when do you practise your craft?
My workshop is an open mic. It’s going up on stage really. What works on stage… we put it up digitally. 
But now that live experiences are compromised, we are adapting a digital-live experience. The idea of our craft is to go on stage with an idea, record the idea… then go on stage the very next day and review/change the idea. Then repeat it after the next day and go on like that. One needs to take time with the art. Now is the time to review and introspect as things have slowed down a bit. Something with a deeper message will take time to write.

You have been an RJ, a musician, an actor, stand-up comic, show host. What is that one thing missing from your CV?
Ohh man!! There are two things actually. My ultimate goal in life as an artiste is to go from being a comedian to a digital influencer to now becoming an artiste and to then become a philosopher. The highest form of being an artiste is being a philosopher or a scientist. These are the thinking professions, among other professions too. I would want to retire, sit and think.

Will this season of Son of Abish feature an ‘Out of Syllabus’ segment, and if yes, what can we expect?
I am very impressed that you asked this question. The ‘Out of Syllabus’ team is already working on something. We are going to do that and it’s going to be on the eighth episode. I can’t tell you the topic yet.

How do you switch off when not performing? Or are you always funny?
I will agree to that… I am not off, which is not always a good thing. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, I used to be on all the time as I used to meet people all the time, always thinking or working on projects. Now I hang out with people on Zoom or WhatsApp calls or conference calls. Now, when I am doing household chores… that is the time I am talking to myself. In that way I am always working… comedy is not about the joke, it’s about the momentum of a feeling.

What’s a usual day in your life like?
I wake up at 7.30am. I vacuum the floor and I start thinking where did all this hair come from! Am I having hairfall?! So maybe I will go bald very soon or this is the hair loss I never noticed. I mop the floor, then I call up my parents in Vancouver, Canada, and I have my first cup of coffee with them. I talk to them for around 40-45 minutes. I haven’t talked so much with them ever… I am getting to know their secrets. Then I shower and meditate. By 12.45pm, I am ready to start work.

Any advice for budding comedians?
I am proud of my consistency. I don’t give up. Even if my joke on stage is bad, I will still go ahead with it. For anyone who wants to be anything, my advice would be ‘don’t give up, be ready to evolve’. Because one needs to let the plant grow, we only need to keep watering it. I am a good gardener of ideas.

Your go-to movie and fave performers?
School of Rock and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit… these are my faves. These are mood-boosters. And music plays a huge part. If I am feeling low, I have a playlist of light songs to fall back on. My fave performance would be the concert by Queen at Wembley in 1984. I love Freddie Mercury’s energy.",culture
A special t2 shoot to celebrate 50 years of Kanishka’s," On August 15, 1970, she started her own boutique line with just a table, chair and a printer in her garage. Her drawing room was transformed into a display room. Nandita Raja’s Kanishka’s is now a household name. The Telegraph caught up with the lady behind Kanishka’s for a quick chat.

The journey: I started it as a hobby. I used to be home all the time because my son, Kanishka, was small. During my school and college days I used to love making designs. In fact I used to have scrapbooks. My husband, Dilip Raja, asked me to do something about my hobby. I started my business in a garage with just one table, chair and a printer.
Every business has ups and downs. At the beginning I used to do everything, which was tough. No one agreed to teach me anything. I went to Serampore to learn block printing. Then I started thinking about the material for block print. I thought of doing it on Bengal’s taant. People at Serampore told me about this haat at Howrah, called Mangla Haat where all taatis come. So I woke up early morning and visited Mangla haat for material.
I did not imagine that my hobby could turn into my profession. Initially it was my friends and relatives who used to buy and then gradually it became what it is now. I have proved to the world that one can turn hobby into a profession.

Memories: While printing it came to my mind that why not tap the looms. We loved travelling to interiors of places. On one such trip, we went to the interiors of Odisha. On our way we saw this cluster of mud huts… around seven of them. In front of one hut they had given a sari to dry. What attracted me was the colourful anchal. I got down from my car to check who it belonged to. I realised all seven houses in that village, Bomkai, wear similar kind of taant sari. They told me that the saris are made in that village itself. The sari is thick but the anchal of all the saris were exceptionally beautiful. When I asked them where they sell, they told me that they make towels and sell them but the saris are made for the women of the community. The women of that village didn’t wear undergarments, hence the saris are made of thick material. The village was near the Odisha and Andhra Pradesh border. I barely understood their language, but we had a local guy with us who helped. What I loved was they drew inspiration from nature and created the designs like tribal people, bird and hunters. They use natural colour, with no chemical mixed.
Sticking to classics: I am a strong believer of tradition. I don’t run behind the ever-changing trends. In fact, my customers also don’t look for trends. Long time ago I had tried making a line of saris with zari and sequins. None of the customers bought them. They were like, “If we have to buy this kind, we will go to AC Market not Kanishka’s. We come here for your original work”.  

Challenges: The biggest challenge is to keep handloom alive. Amidst digital printing and other techniques, but I still believe in block prints. Manually we still apply paints on blocks and print it on materials. This will never change in Kanishka’s. Trends stay for a period of time, but this tradition will always be alive. It becomes expensive but my customer values it. I don’t believe hand-woven and hand-prints are a dying art. This will always stay in our country.
The next generation is studying in good designing colleges and are learning different kinds of techniques. I just hope they don’t forget the tradition. Along with the modern methods, they should keep these traditional methods alive.

The Future: I want to teach someone from the next generation. I had given lessons to someone who used to be there in my showroom from 1988. Now she is very well trained. I am looking for more young people who are ready to learn. I want this to go on even after me. My son and daughter-in-law (Prateek and Priyanka Raja) are busy so they will not be able to help me out in future. They might see overall but for the workshop to go on I want to teach interested young people.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM In celebration of 50 years of Kanishka’s, actress June and singer Usha Uthup posed for The Telegraph in creations by their favourite Kanishka’s 

Newly-wed Tolly star June, draped in a black-and-white block-printed cotton sari, spoke about her memories of Kanishka’s. “I have grown up seeing my mom (Parul) and grandmother (Monorama) wearing saris from Kanishka’s. The block-printed cotton saris used to be mom’s favourite. Every year she used to buy a set of them for the summer. She used to look forward to the colours and prints because Kanishka’s is famous for that. Quite a few saris have been passed down to me as well. The first name that comes to mind when we talk about block-printed cotton saris, is Kanishka’s. The most beautiful part of Kanishka’s is that they have held on to their tradition over 50 years,” said June.
Next, she got into an elegant sari, which she wore in dhoti-style, paired with a black top. “My first buy from Kanishka’s was for my mother on her 50th birthday. I had picked up a nice silk gadwal and south cotton. That was the first time I independently went to the store and bought with my money. Ever since that I have bought quite a few saris and kurtis for myself and kurtas for my son. Their men’s collection is equally good. I also buy their printed materials and stitch them into blouses,” said June.
“My mom had gifted my boro mashi a lovely tussore from Kanishka’s, which I wore and walked the ramp at CC&FC where we celebrated Kanishka’s 25 years. It was passed down to me after my boro mashi passed away. I still wear it because these are like masterpieces and never go out of fashion,” she added after the shoot.  

Usha Uthup posed in a Kanishka’s sari for The Telegraph. “Kanishka’s is a part of me. My bond with Nanditadi (Raja) and her husband, Dilip Raja, became even stronger when Kanishka’s did a sari for me on my song Kolkata Kolkata. Since then I have given them the lyrics of the songs I have sung and they printed it for me, like Bombay meri hai, Ente Keralam ethra sundaram, and Jo kuch bhi ho jaye, in tussore and mulmul saris. Everywhere people loved these saris. Nobody has the designs like Kanishka’s, which makes designs iconic and sophisticated. I love the earthy colours… the deep maroons, rusts, off-white, black, purple. It has been a great journey for Kanishka’s. I cannot imagine my cupboard without my Kanishka’s collection,” said the veteran singer.

EPR makes his presence on audio streaming platforms with a new album — Protest Poetry," Sure, you’ve heard Santhanam Srinivasan Iyer aka EPR’s voice on audio streaming platforms with his band Underground Authority or ADIACOT. But on June 12 a new milestone was achieved. The 31-year-old rapper launched his first audio streaming album, Protest Poetry, on Spotify with a total of 17 originals. While some are from his performances at MTV Hustle, others are a melange of old and new songs by the artiste. The album also features artistes like Nikhita Gandhi, Karma and Void because Srini believes that “no hip-hop album is complete without collaborations”. A chat with the protest poet.

How long did it take you to put the 17-song album together?
One year. Some of them are from (MTV) Hustle and some are tracks I had done before and two songs are completely new.

Why did you make an album instead of smaller releases?
I had a separate release for every track on this album before, barring the two new songs — Rastafari and Into The Unknown. So each has its own set of fans. Basically, what happens when you drop 17 new songs, it fails to make an impact. Why? Because every song needs attention. With this model, it’s rather easy to promote your single than to promote your whole album. So what I did was release them as singles on YouTube and on the other hand I never had an audio streaming impact. I had no presence on Spotify or iTunes because I kept them on hold because I wanted to release all of them at one go… with an album. Once I was ready with the compilation, I changed a couple of things, like rearranged some of the musical parts and remastered something and then put it on this audio streaming platform and called it Protest Poetry!
You take a very strong stand when it comes to politics and 17 songs have 17 different ideas but what does the album stand for as a whole?
The album stands for something. Like hip-hop is more than just talking about cars, boasting, flexing and stuff like that. There are so many issues in the country that need to be addressed. I am taking a step forward to talk about issues that I strongly feel about and the whole motive is such that you inspire other people to do the same. Talk about the issues in your state or about the issues in your surroundings… it’s a way to inspire people to write as well.

A few months ago you spoke about a few collabs with Nucleya and Raftaar. How is that coming along?
So I have ticked one of them. My collaboration with Karma is already there on the album. The next track I’m working on is with Raftaar. He has given me all the responsibilities to start the process. So I’m taking my time on this and within a few months you will see something for sure. There is also an international collaboration on the way with
L-Fresh. I am also working on this new song; I have no title for it… but I’m just writing… and that’s going to come out soon.

Let’s talk about the lockdown. Has your workflow been affected?
There have been no live shows and live shows are the lifeline for every artiste. But where there’s a will there’s a way. I spent a lot of time during the lockdown compiling the album and then releasing it. I have releases with Underground Authority or ADIACOT on Spotify and iTunes. But as a solo performer, I never had that presence on audio streaming platforms where you can actually make money from your own music. I also distributed it through my own label, which means that all the money that I made from my music comes to me and there’s no middleman. But it’s still not the same as performing live. The album is doing fairly well and I got about 100,000 streams in a week. I’m making money through YouTube as well because my YouTube team has become strong. I’ve also been doing a few jingles; I did two ads for MTV.

What are your views about going live?
Yeah, I hate going live. What this lockdown has taught me is that people have started with interviews and talk shows and musicians are performing online, which is fine, but if they keep performing for free and doing these live sessions, it’s going to hurt them because all sources of income get cut. I don’t go live much and I’m not keen on

Call of the craft," There is nothing fancy about Rahul Mishra. “Divya (wife) poochh rahi hai nahana nahin hai kya? That’s the pleasure of working from home,” he shared in the middle of this chat about haute couture and the future of couture. At that very moment, he ceased to be ‘the’ Rahul Mishra, a Paris Fashion Week veteran of 11 seasons or the winner of The International Woolmark Prize (in 2014). Or, when he said that he hadn’t put his four-year-old daughter Aarna to bed during the making of the Haute Couture online show that saw him quarantining to minimise the risk of infection. “‘Papu when you are going to see me?’ she asked me,” he said. And, you felt like reaching out to daddy dearest. You could chat about warp drive with him as much as about warp and weft. As well as the purity of Arundhati Roy as a thought leader akin to the purity of slow fashion. He said he loves Cosmos and Neil deGrasse Tyson and had been reading a lot about Albert Einstein.
As we chatted with Rahul, we got a sneak peek into his working process. He’ll send you images and references of what he was talking about for better engagement. He wouldn’t judge you. Also, the reason why the Delhi-based designer who studied physics followed by design at NID and Istituto Marangoni, Milan, considered acceptance of criticism his biggest strength and his childlike appetite for feedback as his creative fuel. “I don’t want to be like anybody. I am working as an artist,” said Rahul. From that stems fearlessness where only a genuine story matters.
  The Telegraph caught up with him after his Haute Couture online show, (with Federation De La Haute Couture Et De La Mode, Paris, that ‘brings together fashion brands that foster creation and international development’) where he showcased his couture fall 2020/21 line — Butterfly People — through a 7.20 minutes video on July 7. “The mail about this event came to me on May 14 after I opened my factory post-lockdown. They had informed us in March that the physical show cannot happen,” said Rahul who debuted at Haute Couture this January, the only Indian designer to do so.
With an 11-year-old global brand under his belt, Rahul said he was enjoying the moment. Of course!

Many congratulations on unveiling a new collection at an international platform in the middle of the pandemic! What kind of feedback have you got so far?
Everything has been very good. It has given me similar or more impact than organising a physical show in Paris.
Were you nervous?

Yeah, yeah... (on the show day) I was nervous. I was nervous about the communication because it was looking less fashion and more documentary type. This was the first time I was shooting my collection and making a film. Half the film was shot by me. I shot the making for a month. I started end of May when the embroiderers came in and I shot it every two-three days in bits and pieces. So, the first part of the collection was shot by me and the fashion bits were shot by Hormis (Antony Tharakan). He edited it too and respected my photography as well! I was thinking, mera toh amateurwala photography.
We shot in this beautiful studio in Delhi next to a farm area and wanted to finish the shoot with models in one day due to social distancing norms. Hormis kept saying it’s good karma. During the evening, it got breezy. The clouds we shot were moving beautifully. There was the blooming bougainvillea. And though it looked it might rain at any point of time, God postponed the rain too! It was as if it was nature’s design. We are all at the mercy of nature now...
If we look at the pandemic, where nature has put a halt, businesswise and personally too, but this halt is there because the way we were consuming things from nature had been cacophony. It was not in rhythm and harmony. This a smaller blow compared to what scientists are predicting global warming to be like. This is a temporary situation. This has made us realise that we cannot fight nature. It’s better if we find rhythm. Extinction and rebirth are part of nature’s cycle. Progress has been stepping away from nature. We forget billions of other species with whom we share this planet. Who has given us the permission to do what we have done with animals?! So, nature has whispered a warning. So, for me, this is a positive break that nature has given us.

And nature is a strong backstory in the narrative of your collection…
Richard Powers in The Overstory wrote “The best and easiest way to get a forest to return to any plot of cleared land is to do nothing — nothing at all, and do it for less time than you might think.” So, after a long time, there was a clear blue sky in Delhi and the animals returned to their normal habitat. It really struck me how powerful nature is. It balances out everything. All these inspired me for the collection.

How many pieces are there in the collection?
There are 13 pieces. Usually, I make around 40 pieces in a collection. For Haute Couture, we do around 25-30 pieces which are high-end. The collection was put together over six weeks. This was a very different collection jaise hum bana rahein the. We didn’t have the tools ke samne fat se sketch kar do. We were working on WhatsApp group. So my screen time would be such that you would feel main toh wella baitha hoon, life mein. The productivity graph would be so low! More than 100-odd people worked on this. Conceptualisation took three months. Our factory opened mid-May. We usually get six months for execution.

You also struggled to find some answers…
I was sure I wanted to do this. This is truly global. We wanted to look at positivity as this collection gave us so much more hope. We have to take risks and they can only be taken when you are thinking positive. On our social media, we didn’t speak about clothes at all during the lockdown because we felt this was luxury and there so many people struggling.
Then I realised may be this genuine couture is the only way for people to come out of this struggle. So, these pieces of clothes became way more purposeful for me than what I was doing in the past. I did not find these answers easy. It was a couple of months of mental struggle as to why this world needs another beautiful outfit. It’s not about creating beauty alone or another amazing outfit. This was somehow about the backstory. The outfit exists because it employs and provides livelihood to 10 families. It allows them to dream about building their houses. It allows them to send their kids to school. It was a very big call because social media can troll so much. I had to find a genuine voice from my soul. If a craftsman has to dig roads, that will be the biggest disservice. Everyone has to do the best and do what you do best, which is create slow fashion. I realised long back that when going gets tough, you work on your strengths. And, my strength is slow fashion. Saste kapre nahin banane hai. There is a lot more to be done for craftsmen and I think this storm is going to be longer for craftsmen. I am not saying buy a Rs 2 lakh Rahul Mishra garment, but still go buy a Rs 2,000 handloom sari. This is the time when people need to buy things not produced by factories, but humans. And, you named the collection after them…
“Just living is not enough, said the butterfly, one must have sunshine, freedom and a little flower” — adapted from Hans Christian Andersen, it is really important for me because of the migrant crisis and all that is happening around us.
We supported everybody during the lockdown. Then when the factory opened, I asked them jokingly ke: ‘Bare khush hoge, bina kaam ke paise mil rahe hai!’ I joke with everyone. I connect with everybody when it comes to their aspirations. Their reaction was very surprising. They said they were bugged. ‘Hum yahaan kisi tarike se aana chahte the’ they said. I realised that may be living, earning and supporting is not enough. When a weaver sees a motif, he gets so happy. That is indescribable.
During the lockdown, whenever I have gone to the office a couple of times, the roads in the industrial areas appeared far more wider. I was trying to visualise when people go to work, they are like butterflies. They come in a huddle, in clothes of different colours. And, they are so lively. I also started doing butterflies for the collection because they are victims of corrosive pollution. They are so endangered that you might get to see butterflies one season and you might not the next.
This time we saw lot of birds and butterflies. I wanted to talk about that. Why are there so many butterflies? Because of less human interference.  
When I reached my office to execute the collection, I felt like a gardener who is growing these flowers on a piece of fabric and inviting butterflies to come. These people (craftsmen) are like butterflies who are then making my garden more beautiful. Butterflies get nectar, vitality, living out of the flowers and a gardener gets beauty. This thought gave birth to the name Butterfly People. I have been inspired by various things in the past like the earth and rainforest. For this collection, I was inspired by the people. This collection is ‘for butterfly people’, ‘of butterfly people’ and ‘by butterfly people’. 

What did you like about the format?
I like the format because you are otherwise judging the outfit with an eight-10 second viewing on the runway. When you are looking at a fashion show, you are looking at the tip of an iceberg. You are only focussing on ‘what’ is there in front of you, which is 10 per cent. You forget about ‘how’, which is the process, about 40 per cent, and ‘why’ it is being created, which is 50 per cent. This time, it was full of heart.

Didn’t you miss the buzz?
I missed the human interaction, getting feedback right then and there, the kind of energy and personality that a model brings to the clothes, the set-up and the craziness of backstage. It has its own beauty, vividness and craziness, emotional high.
  You were saying you want to mortgage your house…
When I look at the scenario, businesswise everybody is struggling. Right now, yes, I am looking at mortgaging my house so that I can get more finances. Normally, businesses are designed to last two-three months of no sale, but we have achieved our targets, which is great news for us.

Isn’t that a risk with a young daughter?
Everything exists because of the business. It’s fine. Entrepreneurs are risk-takers. And, there is no risk. We have got such a beautiful brand. The house also exists because of this brand, na?

Not many people think like you…
Main ek baat bataa raha hoon aapko. In a normal business, what happens is I have orders and I am working. Orders nahin hai, toh I am not working. This is a chicken-and-egg situation. I would like to give a message to the entrepreneurs that start working so that you have orders. Do not wait for orders. You can wait and get more embroiderers, but those people might not have waiting time. I am so happy I did this.
My this month’s sale has been amazing. I launched e-commerce with the show (@www.rahulmishra.in). The entire collection is available for sale. We also booked some orders. I had bigger plans for the business. So may be for sustenance, I might have to mortgage the property for finances. I need to grow my business even in these difficult times. Grow meaning involve more people.
Till June 2021, I have promised myself that I won’t have any lay-offs. Looks like this pandemic will stay with us for long. We are a family. Even without zero revenue, Divya and I have calculated that we would be able to support everyone. I did these calculations in April-May when we didn’t know how long the lockdown would last. Beyond that I don’t I know.
Ek aur baat hai, very honestly, nahin kuch hoga toh jaake pada lenge college mein (laughs). If not that, I’ll do organic farming. If you do everything for the kids, you don’t leave them with anything to do in life. When was future certain anyway? In business, I prepare for the worst.
What is your approach to e-commerce now?
We have the direct-to-consumer approach now. We are being able to offer much better pricing than we did ever before. I didn’t do global e-commerce before this because I was doing ready-to-wear, which is bought by a number of retailers and their price points would never match our Indian price points. Now since I am doing haute couture, I could take this chance. This is a risk, but risk comes with confidence. I felt the brand was ready to take on this game of global e-commerce where the brand has enough goodwill.
I have invested very heavily in the last six years in Paris to build a brand, not only in terms of selling but knowledge, respect. People should know us all over the world. 
  Rahul Mishra celebrated with The Telegraph the sixth anniversary of an email he got one July 15, six years ago, around the same time when we called him this July 15! Time: 9.45pm. The email that changed his life. Forever. He described his big ticket to his first Paris Fashion Week in 2014 as “lottery”, the enormity of it hitting him as he stood at Palais de Tokyo that October, an unlikely overwhelmed Divya by his side. The Delhi-based designer has showed at 11 seasons of Paris Fashion Week and two seasons of Haute Couture over these six years. Rahul takes us through the timeline.  Didier Grumbach (former president, Federation De La Haute Couture Et De La Mode) came to see a show at FDCI’s Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week, 2009. It was my debut show and the first day of fashion week. I had done an organic khadi collection. He came to my stall after the show. I explained how it is woven. He loved it and complemented that it is very couture. I received an email from him after a few days later that he was really impressed with my show and asked me to get in touch if I was thinking about Paris Fashion Week at any point. I knew I wasn’t ready and that I had to find my footing in India. 2009 was also the beginning of my company.
Then the Woolmark Prize happened. I won the regional prize in 2013 and in 2014, the International Woolmark Prize. With the confidence of selling collections everywhere, in 2014, in the month of May and June, I happened to travel to Paris for the first time in my life. I wrote to Didier Grumbach informing him that I had won the prize and if I could meet him. He replied after two days. I had to go through a jury he said. On July 15, I received an email saying that my candidature had been accepted. The show was in October (spring/summer’ 15). I started working on some ideas but I must admit, it was more like elaborating on the Woolmark collection. On the morning of the show, we entered the hall. We were showcasing at Palais de Tokyo. Everything was happening for the first time. Suddenly you land at Paris Fashion Week at this amazing historical location where 50 people are working just for you. Your name is written beside an Hermes or Miu Miu in a similar font. It struck me then that this was really big! I showed The Ferryman’s Tale. I was from India, getting stories of Indian craftsmen kai saare samundar paar kar ke, like a ferryman, to this new world. The first time is always special.

2015 (Fall/Winter)
I experimented a lot with merino wool for My Village which took inspiration from my village. I took embroidery to the next level in terms of interpretation.

2016 (Spring /Summer)
It was again a next step for me. I started experimenting with 3D embroidery. It was called Fourth Dimension. It was labour of love, handmade.

2016 (Fall/Winter)
With It Felt Love!, I took bandhni to Paris and used patterns that emerge from the beauty of porcelain.

2017 (Spring/ Summer)
Then Elisa Nalin, the stylist, came on board to work with me. So, I started experimenting with layering. The 3D got a different feel. This made me think about fashion in a new kind of language. Henri Rousseau’s jungle was an inspiration for The Rainforest. The clothes got a bit girlie and styling came into it.
2017 (Fall/Winter)
I started experimenting a lot more with colour. I started doing Van Gogh kind of sunflower motifs. Paul Signac was also an inspiration for this Pointillism-inspired collection called Infinity that celebrated the boundlessness of human hands. It allowed me do French knots my way, things which are a lot more dimensional, playing with threads almost in a similar way in which a painter uses his brush. It allowed me to think like an artist.

2018 (Spring/ Summer)
There is a theory which says there was no colour on the planet in the beginning and light got all the colours, which honeybees see. They ride the wavelength of light, which is like a highway for them. So, this was the first time I experimented with so much colour for Light in the Sky.

2018 (Fall /Winter)
I did some strong graphics for Rhizome. Whatever memories of travel I had, I tried to weave it in the collections. Some things are colourful and some are colourless. CG Jung’s rhizome was an inspiration. This was my first brush with sequins.

2019 (Spring /Summer)
I played with new kinds of silhouettes for Gossamer. White-on-whites. Chikankari. I played with a craft called daraz. It is a technique where two layers of fabrics are sewn together and then they are cut out. I also did a lot of textiles for that season.

2019 (Fall /Winter)
For Village Diary, I used all hand-woven textiles. There was Maheshwari and wool blends. It was inspired by my childhood in my village of Malhausi (in Uttar Pradesh).
I applied for Haute Couture too this year, but I needed to do something out of the calendar. I did an entire set-up of putting all the embroideries together. It was showing them a new kind of 3D embroidery. My first Haute Couture participation was not a part of the calendar. This was in July. There were 20 garments in Metropolis 1 (Fall 2019/20 Couture). It involved 3,400 human hours of hand-cutting and hand-embroidering. This was about interpreting cities.

2020 (Spring /Summer)
The Metropolis 2 show had similar pieces like Metropolis 1, an extension, but there were also black-and-white pieces. I took my 3D to the next level even in ready-to-wear, a body of work deserving of haute couture. The jury again happened, which was far more stricter, for Haute Couture, which was this January. I am a guest member. As a guest member you need to perform really well. You are always on your toes!
A month later I got an email confirming my Haute Couture show, marking another beginning. I redefined how I was making clothes and how I wanted to do 3D. It was supposed to be more expressive and more experimental. You have to go five notches above what you have been thinking. It was called Home and it gave me the license to go all out. Everybody said this is the new language of haute couture. It doesn’t need to be a showpiece. For me, it takes inspiration from today’s women... how they are more powerful than ever before.
I did an exhibit in ready-to-wear in March called Home 2. I came back in the beginning of March, quarantined and by March 22, everything was under lockdown. This collection had simpler pieces, softer, cleaner, neater. ",culture
‘I am experiencing the joy of the here and now in a way that I have never done before’ — Shabana Azmi," Shabana Azmi is focusing on the ‘here and now’, spending time with family, catching up on her thoughts and striving to give back to society in these times of the pandemic. The veteran actor revealed all, in conversation with film-maker Sangeeta Datta, at a virtual closed-door session for Ehsaas Women, an initiative of the Prabha Khaitan Foundation last week. Excerpts...

Life has brought us to a point where the here and now has become important. So what is the ‘now’ all about for you?
I am in Khandala, in our home Sukoon, which was made with great love about eight years ago by Javed (Akhtar, husband). It’s a gorgeous house, but we’ve never had an opportunity to spend any time here at all. After the lockdown, we came here, and two things have happened. First, this is the first time I have spent this amount of time with Javed in the 36 years of our marriage! (Laughs) Second, as Javed says, it’s a very strange situation, because what the lockdown has done is made us into a joint family from a nuclear family. I have my aunt visiting, my brother Baba and his family are close by, my friend is just within walking distance... so what we have formed is a sort of community.
We were feeling a sort of suffocation in Mumbai... we are feeling much better here. The monsoons are on, it’s absolutely gorgeous and we are surrounded by trees. It’s very relaxing here. It’s quite surreal that in the middle of such a taxing time, we have sort of made a little island for ourselves, where only the ‘now’ matters.
But, of course, one is cognisant of the fact that this is only a bubble and the pandemic is a catastrophe of the kind that most, especially those born after the Partition, haven’t seen and hopefully will never see. There’s a lot of upheaval and the disparity between the haves and the have-nots has become even more evident now. It’s leading me to a kind of introspection and making me re-evaluate many things... like the difference between want and need. Life can actually be lived very simply and I have been wrestling with the idea that less is more. I think it’s a good time in my life to see that I can do with much less and that I need to give much more. All of us, of course, have come forward to help, but I feel that unless you give till it hurts, it doesn’t make a difference. Do you feel we will move towards being a more empathetic society?
We need to really dwell on the lessons this pandemic has taught us and not forget them as soon as things get back to normal. Instead of constantly saying, ‘Oh god, when will this end?’ we should tell ourselves, ‘I don’t know when this will end... let’s live in the now and stop worrying about when and how this will end’. In an almost spiritual way, it makes you aware of the here and now. We spend all our lives either dwelling on the past or imagining a future. We forget the joy of experiencing the now. And that I am doing in a way that I have never done before.

Javed saab has famously said that before this time came upon us, the two of you would only meet at airports or just in passing, given how busy you both are...
The funniest thing is that we have discovered how much we enjoy each other’s company! (Laughs) That’s a good thing after 36 years of marriage, right?!

You had a road accident earlier this year, but plunged into shooting in March. What were you working on just before the world went into lockdown?
I was actually in Budapest shooting for Halo (produced by Steven Spielberg) and then we were told that everything had to be put on hold for the pandemic. I came back to Bombay and immediately went into self-isolation, and everything’s been on a halt since then. I am doing a film with (chef-filmmaker) Vikas Khanna, some portions of that are left. I was supposed to start my series Moghuls with Nikkhil Advani, but that’s on hold. So, in terms of ‘how’ and ‘what’ and ‘when’, there is uncertainty. I am just going with the flow.

Shooting has resumed in some quarters. But I did read an interview of yours recently where you said that television actors above age 65 are not being allowed to come on set because of the susceptibility factor...
It’s quite bizarre. This is apparently a directive of the home ministry for the safety of the senior actors. This is very discriminatory. Why is this limited to only actors? Can anyone guarantee that from now on, anyone above age 65 will not attend political rallies? As long as the concerned person passes the health test and is willing to take responsibility — and it’s the responsibility of the producer too to ensure that all safety measures are in place — then there shouldn’t be an issue. Kanwaljit Singh is such a fine actor and such a fit person but he has been replaced (on the TV show Sandwich) by a 40-year-old guy who has to put grey in his hair and pretend to be 65 years old! We have appealed to the government and to Hema Malini ji, who is a member of CINTAA (Cine & TV Artistes Association), and we are waiting to hear from the home ministry. In Calcutta and Bangalore, actors above 65 are shooting... so why is Mumbai being singled out?

You had a rather unusual childhood that you spent in a commune. Tell us about it...
My father (Kaifi Azmi) only earned Rs 40 for all the work he did for the Communist Party. So my mother (Shaukat Azmi) had to go out and work as a radio announcer with Vividh Bharati and after that in theatre. We lived in Red Flag Hall, which was the commune of the Communist Party. Eight families lived there, in rooms of just about 200sq ft. There was one toilet and one bathroom for eight families. And yet, there was no acrimony. I don’t remember anyone ever fighting... it was really like an extended family. We had a lot of intellectuals living there, all coming together for the similar worldview they had in terms of social justice and gender empowerment.
There was no division of religion at all, but there was a celebration of India’s diverse culture. We always celebrated all festivals, and continue to do so. There was and is a deep respect for the composite culture that is India.

You had your first theatre experience strapped on to your mother’s back...
My mother would strap me on her back and take me to her rehearsals at Prithvi Theatre. When she would rehearse, I would be in the green room and much fuss would be made over me. And when my mother was working, my father would put me on his shoulders and take me to mazdoor-kisan meetings. I would sit on his shoulders and see a sea of red flags being waved. I thought that signified party time... I had no idea it was the Communist Party flag (laughs). On one hand, my mother would take me to theatre and my father to mushairas. My brother and I would invariably go to sleep on stage amid the big bolsters and would wake up to thunderous applause, which meant it was my father’s turn at the mic. We had luminaries like Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Josh Mahilabadi (both legendary poets) as house guests... it was that kind of a childhood.",culture
Six independent booksellers unite to make changes to the industry," The great lockdown of 2020 has meant a lot of different things for different people. Some have suffered while some have tried to overcome the obstacles that have plagued them for a while, which they couldn’t give time to before. It’s the latter for independent booksellers around the country who were already facing myriad issues that are inevitable when one tries to build a business from scratch without any form of corporate backing. A conversation had started brewing long before this year laid down some heavy rules on us and the extra time only helped speed up the process for forming an association of independent booksellers around the country. Speaking to Mayura Misra of the Oxford Storyteller Bookstore in Calcutta, we found out what plagues their business that runs on loyalty for incomparable, personalised service that hardly any bookstore chain can offer. Thus was born Independent Booksellers Association of India (IBAI) that is accepting memberships from around the country as long as you do not have corporate funding.
“We started talking about coming together to pool in our resources to help each other as it happens in the UK and the US,” said Misra of the six bookstore team that has now launched their own website. The team consists of Storyteller Bookstore Kolkata, Pagdandi Bookstore Cafe Pune, Dogears Bookshop Goa, Literati Bookshop and Cafe Goa, Rachna Bookstore and Cafe Fiction Gangtok and Trilogy Library and Bookstore. “While I am specialising in children’s books, some other member has a stronghold on art books or fiction for adults. The idea is to just communicate and cater to each other’s audience, thereby serving your audience better,” she added. Sharing orders and requirements on a common WhatsApp group has become a part of their daily routine now, we are told. “For years we had been kept in the dark by publishers and distributors who give fair-weathered discounts, send authors to literary festivals or chain stores while blatantly ignoring us for e-commerce sites. We thought we could have a single platform and collectively petition to publishers to associate with us,” she said as the next steps for the association.
Shopping local is an imperative now with conversations slowly steering towards the benefits of supporting homegrown businesses around you and IBAI aims to address exactly that and make the process easier for patrons. Bringing the community together is the single-minded proposition from IBAI. The response has been phenomenal. Mailers have been sent out to bookstores and booksellers have shown interest from Kashmir to Delhi and more. The main criteria for membership are that one must have a physical store.

It is a lonesome journey for independent booksellers as they struggle to make their presence felt amongst patrons.
“Independent bookstores are completely on their own and they have to fend for themselves. From publishers to authors, there is a direct link to buy online but they don’t promote these independent bookstores in any way. The presence we have in Calcutta now is because of the extensive work we have done with schools and all of that has been our own doing, with no external help whatsoever but now we need the extra push,” said Misra.
The extra service that booksellers provide along with the personal touch is incomparable. Children come in with their parents on weekends at Storyteller outlet because they consider it a safe space that gets frequently sanitised. Not just the space, but also the books that are sent out don’t pass through too many hands, a promise that giant e-commerce sites are unable to make. “In this lockdown, I have even taken parents through books to help them with home-schooling over a Zoom call,” added Misra and it is instances like these that make you reaffirm your faith in everything IBAI aims to achieve.

"Fear, soul-searching and love. Goshai Gang keeps their lyrics intense"," Goshai Gang knows how to combine rock and pop influences. The Calcutta-based band has released its latest song, Aaj raat, which speaks about the fear that comes with facing the truth. The Telegraph sat down for a chat with the band that completes five years in August.

Tell us the story behind Aaj raat?
Aaj raat is our latest release across all digital platforms. It was written quite a few years back by Saurav Chattopadhyay (vocalist) but we thought of recreating it with a new flavour. So we made a blues-rock version. We are receiving positive responses from all corners and there is an official video on our YouTube channel.

What does the song symbolise?
The fear within to face the truth. Coming to terms with it gives us a lot of courage and this song portrays that mental dilemma. The concept of raat is used as a metaphor to describe the element of mystery that shrouds our mind when we wait for the unknown.

It’s quite groovy like your other songs. But what makes it different?
Musically, we have built an element of tension throughout the song that resolves with the chorus Aaj raat, sesh raat, kaal raat...Cholbe na kono ojuhaat! A groovy guitar intro by Swagato Banerjee creates a perfect way forward for the song to follow. There’s also a saxophone solo and an interesting pop-influenced bridge section, which creates a unique soundscape. We like to call ourselves a rock ’n’ roll band with a lot of modern pop influences.

You have some upcoming releases as well.
Apart from the rock ’n’ roll sound, the band also likes to create soothing ballads, like Shudhu tomay bhalobashi and Kobe shobdera praan paabe, which are very popular among listeners. With upcoming songs like Ke jaaye and Raater gaan, we want to revisit this style of strong melody and soul-searching lyrics. Then there’s Bhorsha tai nei which comes under hard rock. So we are pretty excited about these releases.

And what about the collaborations you had spoken about before?

Ke jaye is actually a collaboration with Pralay (Sarkar), a lyricist from the city. He has already written the lyrics for us but the song is yet to release. It will probably be out in September.",culture
Tarun Tahiliani fashionably adapts to the new normal with a full-length digital fashion show," Can you believe that the last time we met was before the world changed completely but it was just in February?!” With the last four months having made a pestilence, out of all things in the world, an immovable fixture in our lives, I can’t say I don’t get the incredulity of the aforementioned question that I have always gotten from Tarun Tahiliani, every time I have spoken to him in the last few months. But aside from the sheer disbelief, I have also always sensed in him an ability to adapt in a manner befitting the situation at hand, even as early as in May when I caught him over the phone one morning as he was on his way to his Gurugram atelier, when he said, “One must learn to adapt with the times and carry on, especially with so many of my karigars dependent on me!” Cut to July 16 and the man has kept his word as he presented to the world what is India’s first full-length, independent, design-driven digital fashion show in the form of Pieces of You — his autumn/winter 2020 collection — and a culmination of the 25-year sartorial vision of his eponymous label. Set to music by Ma Faiza, the 24-minute digital fashion exposition saw seven models taking turns to showcase the Tarun Tahiliani bridal, festive and menswear collection. Lightweight lehngas, peplum blouses, concept saris, structured drapes, anarkalis and fusion-style jumpsuits designed and created using techniques such as chikankari and mukeish embroidery, specially woven brocades with zardozi, embellishments of Swarovski crystals, pearls and resham feature in this collection that champions the designer’s signature India-modern style. The menswear includes fitted sherwanis and kurtas with multiple layers of fabrics in different lengths, paired with dhotis, bundis and safas, accentuated by impeccable tailoring, seamless constructions of fit and fall and hand embroidery on muted monotones. But for a man as articulate (and tongue-in-cheek) as Tarun, the thought behind his creations is as important as the designs, the dynamism of which is deeply rooted in relevance. In fact, right from the nomenclature of this collection, Tarun has ensured that Pieces of You is something that people can relate to. “The year 2020 has forced us to look inwards. And some of us have embraced that challenge. Hitting the reset button has been nothing but an act of bravery. Questions, stories, memories, dreams — so many hidden parts of us are now coming to the fore. So with the onset of the new season, it feels like the only thing to celebrate now is you,” said Tarun as he explained the thought behind the name.
The story of the Indian bride whose lehnga zipper came undone due its sheer weight, as Tarun had earlier recounted to me, has stayed with him, which is why style and practicality embrace a lightness of being to make up the inimitable TT style. “Why will a modern bride get weighed down by embellishments so much that it restricts her movements? I have always been interested in men and women looking Indian but being modern in their approach. Especially at present with intimate weddings being the norm, the focus is on lighter but finer designs. In a room of about 50 people, you will meet and talk to everyone as compared to a wedding in a hall with 1,000 people. The attention will be on the details and not the embellishments, which is what this collection also showcases,” said Tarun. For a man who started out with one of India’s first fashion shows as we know it now, way back in 1988 in Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Hotel for Ensemble, it must also be rather poetic to be behind the country’s first digital, full-length fashion show then? Not for Tarun, who is deeply rooted in pragmatism as he says, “All of that has been done rather unwittingly, you know. You have to do what you have to do! Fashion just can’t be seen on mannequins — it has to be seen on people!”
Team TT has worked diligently behind the scenes for three weeks to come up with this show, which was shot at his atelier that saw a big room converted into a taupe jade ramp-like setting, adorned with exquisite antique carpets from The Carpet Seller. “I am a bit mad and usually have about 80 models but this one had just seven. All the parties involved strictly adhered to safety protocol with hair and make-up artists in hazmat suits, everyone in masks, social distancing in place and each model getting a room to themselves and a bag with all the paraphernalia. During the shoot, everyone was in masks behind the scenes and the few cluster-choreography sequences also had space between the models,” explained Tarun.
Of course like most other designers, he believes that fashion cannot be digital all the way but he is optimistic about making the best of the situation. “Of course we want to show live but if you think about it, there are probably 1,400 people in the room during fashion week, right? The rest of the world is seeing a digital version, whether it’s on Instagram or on TV. Of course it is important to see it live because you can’t tell quality or the difference between polyester and silk because both are shiny fabrics. There’s a whole social part to it that you miss. But right now when everything is anyway faltering, you have to keep going — there’s no other way!” he said. From the beginning of the lockdown in our country, Tarun has been acutely aware of its economic pitfalls, especially down the lower rungs of the design ladder comprising craftsmen and karigars and has always been vocal about their role in the Indian fashion industry even before Covid-19 had hit us. Therefore it’s only natural that his ideas surrounding the recent pandemic-and-PMO-driven popular sentiment for “vocal for local” is more informed and convincing than the mere jingoism surrounding it. “Indian designers always relied heavily on India crafts. More than ever, we need to do more. We need to do more ready-to-wear and more beautiful pieces with, say, one piece of beautiful embroidery instead of one beautiful chikankari sari that can only be worn by a few. This is what we have to do to expand the market for our crafts. Bridal and occasion-wear markets are now shrinking. The craftsmen won’t get other jobs because they’re not trained otherwise and so, this is also our social responsibility and our USP as Indians!” said Tarun, acknowledging that the responsibility lay both on the sides of buyers and sellers.
And the Tarun Tahiliani label is poised to do the same as can be seen in Pieces of You already, curated to include lighter and finer designs. “I am dying to do ready-to-wear and mark my words, you’ll see it soon! As of now, we have to make the best of the situation by giving it our best,” signed off Tarun.",culture
"Natasha Celmi’s new cookbook is a sure-shot way to be fast, fresh and flavourful in the kitchen"," Natasha Celmi had a very specific idea in mind when she decided to pen her cookbook Fast Fresh and Flavour: Everyday Meals Made Easy — to not let anyone spend too much time in the kitchen trying to source fancy ingredients to recreate international dishes that take immense labour and are saved for ‘special days’ only. Cooking must be effortless, she feels. “My audience is the urban young crowd and this book was written to address the problem of young people refusing to eat dal chawal every day for their meals. We are global citizens now and people are exposed to international flavours all the time and they wonder how to make a good Pad Thai or a good salad at home,” says Natasha, who herself delved into cooking less than a decade back after being averse to the very idea of anything to do with the kitchen. She now has a flourishing social media presence with her successful blog Cucina Mia by Natasha Celmi.
“This whole book is not just about recipes but it is about time management. The first word is ‘fast’ and at the same time it’s fresh. I am not using bottled sauces and the likes and it’s definitely flavourful. The idea was to simplify the process and not spend the day in the kitchen,” she said and we agree. For her book comes equipped with ways to manage leftovers, to meal-prep on weekends so your dinner is ready in half an hour after coming back from work and we learnt the usage and value of the phrase “cooking smart” where one doesn’t spend eons figuring out logistics of cooking.
Don’t let the “Vibrant Vegetarian” tag mislead you for this book is for everyone. Her vegetarian take on all dishes come equipped with a small tip at the bottom, telling you how exactly to bring a non-vegetarian twist to it. She is herself a non-vegetarian but increasingly finds herself leaning towards a plant-based diet. We probed her a little on this trend that can now be seen amongst a lot of this generation. “The dishes oftentimes or in most cases get their flavours from the vegetarian elements and then one can add whatever meat they like. Moreover, in my cooking classes I have noticed non-vegetarians come in for a vegetarian class to learn to make a good pasta sauce maybe,” she added.
Her husband is Italian and is a superb cook, we are told, and he enjoys his lentil burger or a sweet potato burger just as much as he appreciates a non-vegetarian platter. “A lot of people are finding that being vegetarian is a healthier dietary option for the system. It’s about balancing health and flavours,” said Natasha and that is the reason why she has kept her book completely flexible. This book is especially aimed at non-vegetarians to assist because they are the ones who need to glamourise their food and not let a sabji be just “boiled potato or cabbage”.
The book is available on Amazon and Flipkart and is already topping the charts on the former. Natasha wants her readers to create the dishes in her book, which include the likes of Italian Zucchini Rolls, Barley Risotto, Easy Cheesy Quesadillas and Kung Pao Cauliflower and then tag #FastFreshFlavourful because we all know now that you haven’t really cooked if it’s not click-worthy. And her dishes are just as palatable and flavourful as they are glorious to ‘gram! Grab a copy and if you have any questions, the author is available for her online cooking classes!
  Comfort in a bowl, aka Thai curry! This has sated many cravings, especially during my travels in Thailand. Back home, I recreated a milder version with less chilli and my own home-made paste, which brings a freshness and balance that is so characteristic in Thai food. Double the quantity of curry paste and store it for days in the refrigerator. You then need less than 30 minutes to make the rest of the curry after a long day at work. Serve it with noodles in a bowl instead of the usual steamed rice as a variation.
Ingredients
(Serves 4)
Green curry paste (makes 1 cup)
2 lemongrass stalks
2 green chillies (or more)
1tbsp ginger, grated
6 garlic cloves, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2tbsp light soy sauce
1 cup coriander leaves and stems
1/4 cup Thai basil leaves
6 Kaffir lime leaves, torn
Zest of a lime
1tsp coriander powder
1tsp cumin powder
1tsp lime juice
1tbsp water
The curry
2tbsp sesame or vegetable oil
1 cup green curry paste
3 cups coconut milk
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 carrots, sliced
1/2 cup baby corn, diced
2 cups broccoli or cauliflower florets
4 Kaffir lime leaves, roughly torn
Chilli powder
2tbsp light soy sauce
3/4 cup water
2 tsp brown sugar zest of a lime
1 cup tofu cubes
1/2 tsp salt
2tsp lime juice
To serve
5-6 basil leaves
8-10 mint leaves
Rice or noodles
Quick tip: If you do not have lemongrass or Kaffir lime leaves handy, replace with an extra teaspoon of lime zest.
Method:
Prepare the lemongrass and slice it roughly. Blend all the ingredients together for the paste till you get a smooth green paste. Store the curry paste in the fridge or use straight away.
Heat the oil in a curry pot. Stir-fry the green paste for 2 minutes with a cup of coconut milk to get a thick, aromatic base.
Add the vegetables (not the tofu) and saute for a minute. Add the Kaffir lime leaves and red chilli powder (if using). Add water along with the light soy sauce and salt.
Cover and cook on medium heat for 2-3 minutes till the vegetables are cooked halfway. Add the brown sugar, remaining coconut milk, lime zest and tofu cubes.
Simmer on low heat for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Squeeze in the fresh lime juice.
Finish with some fresh basil and mint leaves, and serve with rice or noodles.
Make ahead/leftovers: Make some extra green paste, and freeze it in an ice cube tray for up to a month. You should defrost 3-4 cubes of paste for this recipe. The ready curry stays good for 2 days in the fridge.
Meaty addition: Replace half or all the vegetables with 300g of chicken thigh cubes and add it in the beginning. Replace light soy sauce with fish sauce.",culture
Phenomenally black," At the opening of Paris Couture Fashion Week, the first-ever digital version of Paris Couture Week, model Naomi Campbell gave a powerful speech stating the need to “collectively call the fashion world to task regarding inequality”.
Sporting a t-shirt with the slogan “phenomenally black”, Campbell opened the event on July 6, 2020, with a two-minute speech, which was posted on Instagram by FHCM (Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode), the organisers of the Paris Couture Week.
In her speech, the 50-year-old model addressed the Black Lives Matter Movement and the protests going on in the wake of George Floyd’s death. “The fight for diversity and for equality
has been a long journey in society and in the fashion industry,” she said. “It is up to us, it is up to you to start enforcing inclusion of the multitude of identities that compose our countries,”

An old fabric craft," Rogan, a 300-year-old craft tradition that once flourished in Gujarat’s Kutch region, today rests in the hands of Abdul Gafur Khatri’s family in Nirona village in the area. A fabric painting craft that has been handed down through the men, Rogan graced mainly ghaghra-cholis, bridal trousseaus, bedsheets and tablecloths. It now adorns more contemporary items.
A Rogan artist uses paints on fabric using a thick brightly coloured paint-like substance made with castor seed oil. Artisans place a small amount of the paste into their palm, and the paint is carefully moulded into patterns using a metal rod at room temperature.
The rod, which acts as a paintbrush, never comes in contact with the fabric. Later, artisans fold the fabric, creating a mirror image and with it, a design symmetry.
Lack of opportunities took it to the brink of extinction, with entire villages that practised the art switching to other trades. In 1983, a young Abdul Gafur Khatri followed the trend and went to Ahmedabad and Mumbai to find work. There were no tourists visiting Gujarat then and the art was not selling. It was only after a government project that the art was revived again.
Gafur became so attached to Rogan that he took it to the international level. Rogan art was presented to Barrack Obama, by Narendra Modi when he visited the US in 2014. Abdul Gafur Khatri has been awarded the Padma Shri (2019).

Nabarun Bose decodes the music map of Mafia," For music director Nabarun Bose, scoring the music for the Zee5 web series Mafia has been “an exercise in understanding the darker depths of the human psyche and representing that through the soundscape”. “We decided to use unconventional sounds to create this very abstract atmosphere. Sounds which trigger discomfort. Like the opening track begins with the sound of a clock ticking and moves on to travel through thick clouds of ambient guitars, complemented by very unusually jarring sharp riffs before finally opening up to a climax, which is melancholic in a very twisted yet dreamy way,” he says. The Telegraph chats with Nabarun, who has also been playing the keyboard with Anupam Roy for nine years as a part of his band...
What was the idea behind using the guitars, beats, spoken words and piano for the Mafia title track, creating this heavy metal-electronic space?
The title track, as well as a few other themes which constitute the background score, have scattered words spoken in ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) style, sometimes with the sound of heavy breathing, moans and gasps, all of it coming together to create this very abstract sexual tension in the score, which reflects certain aspects of the story. The title track opens with the words ‘Open your eyes’ spoken in a hypnotic, sensual yet dead-cold voice and the sound of a ticking clock. This is actually a nod to the practice of hypnotism which is known to bring back lost memories. Psychology plays a very important role in the story, those who have seen it already know that.
What were you aiming for? Was it to underline or highlight moments, create a mood, inform a scene or heighten the emotional pulse of a scene?
While cinematography is the eye through which a story is viewed, sound design and foley creates the material reality of a film. Similarly, I believe that background music creates the psychological reality of a film. It’s there to translate those things that you cannot touch or see, but you can only feel. While scoring for Mafia, Birsada (Dasgupta; director) and I had decided that the music should not interfere with the realistic pace of the film, so it is crafted in a very creepy way so that it remains camouflaged with the natural sounds of the forests and the hills and sometimes comes forward to reflect the state of mind of the characters when necessary. The background score aims at subtly creating an atmosphere of discomfort, which gets more and more intense as the story gradually unfolds through eight episodes.
There’s a beautiful piano-driven piece mixed with a melodica, which starts off when Ananya’s (Ishaa Saha) birthday is celebrated by her friends in the first episode...
The story unfolds in layers, switching between past and present. The past shows their college days, when they were young, happy and completely in love with their lives, totally unaware of the impending doom. We consciously kept a stark difference in the soundscape, which surrounds their college days and the one that broods over their present. While the former is sweet on the ears with a warm vibe, the latter is rather harsh and intimidating. The sounds of the piano and electric guitars create this very youthful happy vibe and the melodica adds a touch of nostalgia in the themes which complement their happier days. The background score in Namit Das’s episode (five) is very brooding, ominous, with the guitars creating a backdrop. Later the drums kick in. What was the idea behind this piece?
The fifth episode titled ‘Robinhood’ is the turning point in the series. It momentarily takes the audience away from the crisis at present and brings them face to face with the reality of Nitin Kumar’s (Namit Das) complex character. This episode is an origin story. So it had to be different from the rest of the series. The cyclical chord progression played on the guitars reflects the notion of moving in circles because that is the state of mind we see the character struggling with. As he moves forward towards making revelations, the music gets more dynamic with drums and heavier layers kicking in but the cyclical chord progression still remains the same.
The background score references various sub-genres of metal. Why?
Yes it’s mostly industrial metal and there’s a thrash metal piece towards the end too, which too is covered in thick layers of uncomfortable electronic sounds keeping it in line with the rest of the score. Metal represents an extreme form of expression, it’s like a burst of raw energy. As the series is angsty and there’s a lot of rage in the commentary that it makes, so I felt the metal genre would compliment that vibe.
The music gets playful when Nitin Kumar tries to talk to the group in the beginning of episode three. There is a strand of humour there. Did you use ukulele or a mandolin?
Aah yes, it’s mostly ukulele, mandolin and a bit of banjo. Traveller’s instruments you see. Since he appears to be a ‘musafir’ in that sequence I thought it would be fun to create a theme with instruments that one can carry while travelling.
Near the end of the series, there is a snippet of a song...
Yes, while scoring music for the climax I realised that the theme at that point needed some words, to create the impact that we were looking for. ‘So long my light, how bright you shine... so long’ these are words that came to me while watching the montage on that sequence and to create a follow up to those I wrote the words, ‘Whispers like echo, they sleep...’ and hence that little snippet of a song was created. The vocals and most of the voice-designing oriented sounds that you hear on the series has been tracked by Paloma Majumder and myself. So far most of the feedback that I have received is positive (about the music of Mafia).
As a music director, what’s your primary concern when you score for a series?
To blend in with the psychology of the story. I am heavily inspired by the background scores crafted by Satyajit Ray, how he used sounds and very subtle soundscapes to add a certain glow to the scenes.",culture
‘The smile on people’s faces when we reached them with supplies meant more than anything’ — Satnam Singh Ahluwalia," During the lockdown period owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, social activist Satnam Singh Ahluwalia (chairman, IHA Foundation), has distributed langar (community kitchen) food to more than 9,300 people daily for more than 100 days continuously. That makes it more than one million meals served to the needy till now. The Good Samaritan has also distributed ration and other essentials to daily wagers, migrant workers, and others. The Telegraph caught up with him in a heart-to-heart chat on what inspires him to reach out to the people.

You have been doing a lot of charitable work in the past few months. How did it all start?
I received a call from the KMC commissioner at 11.45pm of March 24, the day the lockdown was announced. He said they plan to help all underprivileged people and the people on the street and put up temporary shelters. He also asked me to make food arrangements for 700 people. Things started rolling from there.

Were you a bit scared at first considering that the virus was spreading?
I was, to be honest. After my morning prayers I went to the gurdwara and put together a langar team. We went to the market to purchase our goods. I had to manage the transportation as vehicular movement was limited. I tapped my networks in different parts and got them going. We were already a part of the essential services team.

How did you start operations?
We started giving food to around 500-700 people in shelters. In a week’s time that number had gone up to 9,000. We started putting up small community kitchens. In Diamond Harbour, there’s a gurdwara where we cooked food. Three organisations — Gurdwara Behala, IHA Foundation and Kolkata Response Group — came together to help the cause. So while some people came to the gurdwara for the langar, at other places like slums and hospitals our teams made food accessible. All the information was passed on from the West Bengal control room and the KMC control room.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Then, of course, Cyclone Amphan ravaged our state...
Yes, it was a double blow to our efforts. But before it made landfall, we did a few things. We sent some tarpaulins and water, and dry stuff like muri (puffed rice) and chira (flattened rice) through our local networks because it would be difficult to travel to some places like the Sunderbans. After the cyclone was over we identified a few villages, like for example Amlamati, that were the worst hit. We went there, served food and tried to help. We helped around 400 people with rations and assured them of total support for the next three months. We tried to repair their houses, constructed toilets and set up community kitchens.
When Cyclone Amphan hit us, it became our moral duty to assist the administration in whatever way we could. We all as citizens need to stand by the people who have been affected to rebuild our Sonar Bangla, if each and every one of us decides to help the affected and support our mission we would be able to achieve our goals faster.

Any initiatives for the city after the cyclone?
For Calcutta, we had set up a 24x7 helpline for assistance. People started calling us if they faced power disruptions so we had to contact the power department. There were people whose homes had been inundated and they could not get essentials like breads or biscuits or medicines. Also trees had been uprooted, blocking movement and we got 50 men from the Kolkata Response Group to assist the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to chop the trees and clear the mess.

Did you receive any help from the state or central governments?
We did everything on our own because if we had waited, our mission and vision would have been affected. But we received an acknowledgement letter from the Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee. Then Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s mayor and now chairman, board of administrators, Firhad Hakim, sent me a letter too. The district magistrate of South 24 Parganas, Tanvir Afzal, sent a note of thanks. The NDRF commandant, Nishith Upadhyay, sent us a letter of appreciation too, for our efforts. We got help from the police, the administration. In the villages, the DMs, BDOs and the SDPOs helped us.

You have been working tirelessly for some months now. Tell us about the experience.
It was a lifetime experience for me. It has been more than 100 continuous days, cooking and serving people. This is God’s wish… if not me someone else would have done it I am sure. The smile on people’s faces when we reached them with supplies meant more than anything. It’s a humbling experience. On World Environment Day (June 5), we started a drive to sanitise religious places — of all faiths. We also took care not to use alcohol-based sanitisers there, we imported iodine-based sanitisers.

Any particular incident that stands out?
A woman came up and asked if she could get a cup of tea. So I offered her. She had two cups. She then said she wanted to help in her own little way. I said there was no need but she wouldn’t listen. Next day, she came back with around a kilo of tea leaves. She said, ‘You are doing a wonderful job. I will be happy if you accept this’. That kind of emotion is priceless where people of all castes and age groups come up and appreciate our work. The love we got was worth the effort.

Tell us about your vision of langar on wheels.
Since due to COVID-19 people could not venture out of their homes, we thought why not take the langar from the gurdwara to the people. We are planning to have a permanent langar on wheels. I am designing a food truck. We will make small kiosks and the truck will supply food to these and in places there are no kiosks, the vehicles will serve the cooked food directly.

Tell us about your team and how did you plan?
Operations is my hardcore forte since I am into the security business. Serving people and organising langars is in my DNA really. I had three verticals —the cooking team, the distribution chain and the purchase group. The Behala gurdwara langar team of 15-20 people supported me. I got volunteers from the Kolkata Response Group.

Anything that you would like to enhance in the operations?
We are mulling using a roti-maker though we had 20 women on the job. It’s easier and faster and many people prefer rotis to rice owing to health issues. We would like other organisations to fund our charitable work so that we reach more people.

You love cooking. Did you make anything special in the lockdown?
I have been trying a few dal preparations for the langar. At home, I would cook potato rolls, palak pakoras, chhola-bhatura, kulcha, dahi vada. I tried my hand at old Indian recipes. I made potato-stuffed bread rolls, onion samosas, papri chaat etc.

Any message you want to give out to people?
We sit in our homes and think someone else will do it. We blame other people or the governments. Rather than protesting, it is better to do something ourselves.

Urvashi Kaur decodes the DNA of her label that champions being you," Urvashi Kaur talks like she designs. Details are of consequence. “It’s really about having closer connections and understanding people’s intricacies. Which is why these tiny details make a whole lot of difference,” she says. She’ll listen to you and ask you questions before replying. And, you get a sense of her heart. Simple and beautiful. Yes, much like her designs which are “almost hand-done”, versatile, inclusive, strongly individualistic and reflective too. Like the observant Urvashi. We caught up with the designer who is currently in the UK with her family.

When did you travel to the UK?
We travelled out in early May. My son had a doctor’s appointment. We have a home here. So, it was like moving from one home to another.

How have you adapted to the pandemic?
I come from an army background. Change has been constant in our lives. Adapting to any change doesn’t take us very long. I think I have been to 12 schools in 12 years. My studio is at my home. It allows me the freedom to walk in and out of workspace and be around my family. I’d always be available when my three kids came back from school. The only difference was my staff couldn’t be around as much. Zoom played a key role. This has given us that time to introspect and then sort of realign ourselves with this new reality.
Earlier you were in this race. As a brand, we have always worked with small productions. We have never been on sale. Now we are talking about it to our clients because there is this big shift that is going to happen and people are going to be wanting to only spend on things which have a longer shelf life.

You just launched your SS’20 collection Vasara. The pieces look calming…
We managed to do a product shoot and it looks beautiful. It was prophetic in a way, with all the turbulence, you want to find some peace and serenity in the world. That was at the back of my mind when I was designing it and creating it. You have also been working on a series of digital artworks…
My team and I have been working on some content that is a visual, creative expression of everything we’ve been feeling and experiencing as a fallout of the pandemic. It’s a series of illustrations that represent the label’s beliefs and ideology against the backdrop of the world today.

The label is more than a decade old. Do you remember how it all started?
I have a theatre background, studied history, worked with a designer and then I decided that I want to do fashion. I was first acting and then doing costumes for theatre. Then I went to Paris to study fashion at ESMOD. They teach in French and I speak French. I was in a French school in Algeria. So language was not an issue. I was into exports too.
My first collection at Wills (Lifestyle India Fashion Week) was all muslin, ikat, ecru and some of the silhouettes that emerged in that collection have become signature. There was a purity and simplicity. With every passing collection, I began exploring more and more.

You were naturally drawn towards Indian art and craft…
My dad (Gen. retd J.J. Singh, the former chief of army staff and governor of Arunachal Pradesh), was in the army. So, I travelled across India. You haven’t heard of these places. People haven’t seen these places. My mom being an artist, she was in love with the beauty of the people and their stories. It is just wonderful to get a glimpse into their lives. Exploring Indian weaves and our traditional crafts and techniques and weaving them into my clothes was something very natural for me. It is subliminal.
Then after school I was in Delhi. I did my university in Delhi and now I live there, but I am travelling all over the world. So, for me travel is second nature. A bit of that nomadic lifestyle is evident in my work because it is all about layering and taking off the layers and being in comfortable clothes that you can’t feel the weight of. Natural textiles that breathe and something that lends a lot from our Indian heritage but I try to make it as contemporary, practical and functional as possible. A lot of young people then have a look at it and say: ‘Oh, I can carry this off!’

What were the challenges when you started out?
We were literally a handful. Sustainable designers and khadi was simply not a buzzword. I did it because it was organic to me. Now they have made it a trend. I am like… ‘ please, it’s not a trend’. It has been there forever and it has a deeper meaning with our Indian consciousness. Back in time, it was a larger purpose. I think now India and the world is coming to a point where we need to start and look beyond our personal desires and needs. How we can create and consume consciously. Even if people think of it as a trend, it would still permeate and push people to support more weavers, artisans, crafts.
When I started, the challenges were the weavers, the timeline because this is a disorganised industry I think. Also, stores weren’t buying or investing in collections that were khadi based and working at a price. Pret was at its nascent stage at that time. It was a challenge to convince. We lost many orders because we didn’t get our fabric on time. It’s been a journey. Now, it’s better, apart from the economic slowdown where everyone is rethinking retail.
I work with The Handloom School by Sally Holkar (in Madhya Pradesh) who is inviting weavers’ children to come learn weaving from different parts of the country. We buy what they produce and collaborate with some form of design intervention.

You have worked with various clusters…
I have done some collections with the weavers of West Bengal in jamdaani and then kota. I continue to keep kota in almost every collection. It’s perfect for our country and I love grains and textures. I work with weavers who develop khesh, which I turn into layers and jackets. I work with a lot of khadi, my favourite, from Bhuj and Andhra Pradesh. I love Chanderi and also matka. I also use noil. It is a lot of fun to work with because you can use it in so many different ways and it is so lightweight.

What is the language of layering for you?
It is the key to accessorise and change a look. You can put it on in the evening, change your lip colour and put on an accessory or two and you are sorted from day to evening. Everybody can find their best combination. And, we are also so layered as human beings.

Your collections have no seasons…
Traditionally, I don’t label because I promote trans-seasonal clothing. We need to reinforce the idea that something which is beautiful and aesthetic and goes with your personality and something which you have chosen with a lot of love, should not be discarded every six months or sooner. I believe it should be passed on and worn as many times as possible.

People are just about embracing androgynous dressing and gender fluidity. You have been exploring it for a decade now.
Simply wanting to break the norms and existing stereotypes and fashion provides us that freedom to express one’s own individuality. It is about blurring the norms and celebrating the individual because I am personally a non-conformist, so it was a natural choice.

So, how not to clone dress?
I want people to explore and find themselves a little more. Take risks. Women have been conditioned for years. They aren’t really great supporters of each other... but that takes you nowhere. The more women take ownership of their decisions and be financially secure, it gives them a certain power over how they dress, how they are. I want women to be free. We are such superpowers. We haven’t done a lot for ourselves and for women in general. I think if you have the confidence to not conform to an idea, then you enjoy the journey better because it is your journey.",culture
Here are our fave Indie Music acts that are dominating the playlists of the youth," 1.  The Local Train
Few would have thought this rock band from Chandigarh would have reached the heights it has when it came into being in 2008. A decade and two acclaimed albums later, The Local Train continues to be one of the most sought-after bands and is a headliner at most prominent cultural and college fests around the country. While many have pondered over the reasons behind their remarkable success, their soulful Hindi and Urdu lyrics, and unparalleled stage presence and inexplicable connect to the youth with topics like existential crisis and lack of direction and finding a voice, prove they are only going to get bigger.

2. Prateek Kuhad
One of the first Indian independent artistes to gain a truly mammoth following in the past decade, you’ve probably been living under a rock if you haven’t heard of Prateek Kuhad by now given that he was a part of Barack Obama’s favourite music of 2019 list too. His unique aesthetic transcends from his music to his videos, with cold/mess and Tum jab paas standing out for their colourful elegance. All his albums have a nuanced narrative, taking listeners back to places of romance and heartache, from simpler times.

3. Ankur Tewari
The man behind Gully Boy’s stellar soundtrack, Tewari’s refreshingly diverse touch made the album stand out from run-of-the-mill Bollywood music. But despite his recent big-budget projects, including Yeh Ballet and Guilty, both streaming on Netflix, his sensibilities remain indie, with every track by his band, Ankur & The Ghalat Family, bringing a wave of emotions. Apart from music production, Tewari shines as a songwriter, using his music to give a voice to glaring issues.  With his recent single, Woh hum nahin, he speaks out against oppression and pays tribute to the determination of the masses.
4. Anuv Jain
Anuv’s hard-hitting lyrics, paired with his mesmerising guitaring and stirring high-note vocals, create the perfect space to drown in feelings of love and loss. The Ludhiana-based singer, songwriter and composer cemented his place among the country’s best indie artistes with his new single, Maula, launched during the lockdown, a song based on his feelings of turmoil upon losing his father at the age of 17. With over 16 million views from his four singles on YouTube at just 25, we can’t wait to see where Anuv goes next.
5. Taba Chake
Born in Arunachal Pradesh, Taba grew up in a Nyishi tribal family, and his music is heavily influenced by nature and his tribal culture. His acclaimed trilingual debut album, Bombay Dreams, was autobiographical in essence, speaking about his personal struggles and journey as an outsider trying to make it in Bombay, besides talking about love, hope and unity. Not only does it resonate with everyone who is trying to accomplish something despite countless hurdles, but also brings a sense of positivity, which is Taba’s ultimate goal. 6. Parvaaz
This Bangalore-based band uses its international progressive and psychedelic rock influences to create music that provides an experience reminiscent of the greatest international rock bands, like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and U2, but one that is still distinctly Indian. Their Urdu lyrics are poetry, when read without the melody, and despite completing a decade on the scene, every single song they put out has freshness around it.

7. When Chai Met Toast
If you’re looking for music that is uplifting and spirited, this Kochi-based folk-rock band should be on your playlist. Their lyrics are a blend of English, Hindi and Malayalam, and their music videos tell a story of hope, with the band even going on to say that their genre of music is ‘happy’. Everything about them, from their quirky name (it came from a cafe’s menu card) to their electric stage presence (their use of the banjo deserves a special mention) make them a favourite for young indie music lovers.

8. Tajdar Junaid
One of the finest songwriters, producers and composers in the country, Calcutta-bred Tajdar Junaid creates sounds that hit you with nostalgia and stir something within your soul. Not only is he an expert at several instruments, including the guitar, charango, ukulele, mandolin and sarangi, but also expertly uses them along with his voice to create critically acclaimed scores. His collaboration with film-makers like Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Jeffrey D. Brown has brought him a devoted, niche following. His music evokes a seamless blend of his varied influences both from the West and the East.

9. Raghav Meattle
After achieving success and recognition as a contestant on The Stage, Raghav quit his corporate job and moved to Mumbai for a full-fledged career in music. A self-confessed writer more than a musician, his lyrics talk about adulting and the things that come with it, saying a lot with very little. His magical instrumental make him the perfect companion for lazy afternoons or melancholic nights. In addition to a stellar debut album and some great singles, he also hosts an Instagram live called Late Night Cone-versations, where apart from trolling himself, he gives upcoming talent a chance to perform.

10. Anand Bhaskar Collective
Everything about them — be it the music, the song names or the album art — tells listeners about their roots. Anand Bhaskar Collective, a Mumbai-based band, brings together Carnatic music with alternative rock and Hindi lyrics, making for a unique sound. With tunes that strike a chord across demographics, their meteoric rise isn’t surprising, dropping two albums within their first three years in the scene. In an environment where bands either struggle to find their voice or stop evolving once they do, ABC found it at the very beginning, and still manages to surprise listeners with every track. 11. Mali
Apart from a stirring voice and a diverse vocal range, quite like some of the all-time pop greats, Mali aka Maalavika is honest with her emotions while writing, something that immediately connects with you. Her music is driven by melancholy (and some overthinking), and her accolades include appreciation from A.R. Rahman.  

12. Deepak Rathore Project
Listed among the top 50 most prominent bands in the country by Sennheiser, their brand of folk rock music isn’t about mindless headbanging, but something you could sway to and sing along with in abandon. With a heavy influence of the mountains in their music and scenic videos, this should be on your playlist if you are missing your yearly escape to the hills.

13. Short Round
Jishnu Guha’s alias Short Round is a hauntingly beautiful presence on our Spotify playlists, consistently trying to push the boundaries around lyrical folk-rock and creating some diverse music in the process. His collaborations with some of the best independent artistes in the country in a set-up where everyone is playing to their strengths, provide tremendous variety to his library, with moods and themes across the board finding a voice.  

14. Dream Note
This Jaipur-based rock band is widely loved for its powerful writing and soulful instrumentals, with their single, Waqt ki baatein, grossing over 1 million streams on both Spotify and YouTube, and becoming the go-to song for youngsters dealing with heartbreak and rejection. With therapeutic music that has the power to heal, we’re eagerly waiting for their first full-length album, which is likely to drop very soon.

15. The Yellow Diary
Five people came together from non-musical professions to form one of the most popular bands in the country in less than half a decade. This Mumbai-based group brings poetry, top-notch production and powerful rock together to create its own niche in Hindi-Punjabi music, in a space where the latter is dominated by stereotypes and mindless lyrics. Much like their name, their songs too represent a myriad of yellow emotions, be it jealousy or sunshine. 16. aswekeep-searching
A band that creates ambient experiences as much as it creates music, aswekeepsearching has a weirdly detached, yet extremely inclusive appeal, with their artistic sensibilities bringing a refined perspective to modern post-rock music. Once you get over the layered instrumentals and brilliant production, you notice the degree of experimentation in every record, with great collaborations raising the bar higher with every track. Their latest album, Sleep, is perhaps the need of the hour, aiming to calm nerves and bring peace to those dealing with mental health issues.  

17. Thermal And A Quarter
Over the course of two decades and eight albums, TAAQ has not only revolutionised the indie scene in Bangalore, but also developed its own unique style, Bangalore rock. Their influences are quite Western, but their sensibilities remain Indian. Besides touring the world and opening for legends like Guns N’ Roses and Deep Purple, they also try to give back to the scene with their music school.

18. Easy Wanderlings
This Pune-based soul-pop collective made a mark with its very first album in 2017 and following its second record in 2019, won the Best Band title at The Indian Music Diaries Awards 2020. Their music is a worthy accompaniment to afternoons spent in solitude, and their gigs are intimate events where every single member of the audience feels personally spoken to by the music.

19. The F16s
Based in Chennai, this sonically vibrant and lyrically diverse alternative group have their own corner carved out in the Indian indie scene, experimenting with styles and genres and creating music that is impossible to not tap your feet to. The rawness from their very first record is still intact, and their tracks can easily elevate the mood of any house party.

20. Osho Jain
Despite gaining a devoted audience, the most remarkable quality of Osho’s music is how it never feels commercial, with his gigs preserving the intimacy of a close friend jamming with you. His lyrics are honest and vulnerable, beckoning you to sing along, and his finesse with the ukulele and guitar ensures that they never overpower his writing.",culture
Rare book firm Peter Harrington puts a digital spin on browsing for rare books to buy," Rare book collectors in India who have perhaps spent some time during the lockdown days flipping through their precious collection, will now have further reason to whet their appetite.
London-based Peter Harrington, Europe’s largest rare book firm, has released their catalogue of Indian books in a digital format. That is as close to real as one can get in these troubling times.
High-resolution pictures with brief notes on each book is available in this digital catalogue of the 40-item collection which includes the first edition in English of the Sikh holy text, eye-witness accounts of the Mahratta Camp and the courts of the ruling families of Punjab, military reminiscences, and illustrated depictions of traditional Indian sports.

This first-of-a-kind interactive catalogue captures the Indian sub-continent from the 18th to the 20th century and contains eye witness accounts of people like Johann Martin Honigberger, a Romanian-German court physician in the Sikh state, and Fanny Parks, who travelled across India, mostly along river routes, and touched places like Agra, Cawnpore (Kanpur), Meerut, Delhi and Landour in the Himalayas.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM The Telegraph had an insightful conversation with Pom Harrington, who owns Peter Harrington, about the relevance of a digital format and the meaning of rare book collection in today’s times. Excerpts.

Could you please give us a glimpse into the present Indian market in terms of interest and involvement when it comes to rare books?
Rare books from the Indian sub-continent tend to enjoy interest from collectors not just from India, but also from the wider Indian diaspora based in the UK and other global capitals. This collection in a way represents the highlights of our wider India collection — we currently have more than 200 titles on India available for sale on our website — and is a good representation of the breadth of the collection in terms of the subject matter. From military history during the period of colonial rule, to travelogues and first-hand accounts of individuals who traversed the sub-continent in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, studies of the region’s flora, fauna, architecture and topography, exotic indigenous religious practices such as serpent worship, the Indian struggle for freedom from British rule, and finely illustrated accounts of hunting tours and field sports — there is really something to appeal to even the most eclectic collecting tastes.
In addition to collectors of Indian origin, we see steady interest in rare books on the Indian sub-continent from British collectors who are interested in this fascinating period of colonial history. Institutional buyers such as museums are also always an interesting prospect.

How has this interest changed or evolved over time?
Our core buyers used to come primarily from the UK and the US markets, or international collectors who would make their annual pilgrimage to the bookshop on their summer trips to London. However, today we see buyers come to us directly over the Internet from all over the world. People are a lot more comfortable now buying online from a trusted and reputable dealer who is accredited with the major trade bodies.
At Peter Harrington, every book we sell has been hand-picked by a member of our team, who are experts from different fields and research and meticulously vet each book. Each book is checked for completeness, authenticity, it is catalogued and photographed and its provenance traced and documented before it is sold. Peter Harrington is a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers’ Association (ABA) and the International League of Antiquarian Book Sellers (ILAB) and we offer an unconditional guarantee for each item we sell on its authenticity and completeness.
Our buyers today are a more varied mix of experienced and long-term collectors and younger enthusiasts who are looking to build up collections that reflect their personal tastes and interests. We have worked with collectors in the UK and around the world who spend many years building unique collections, from accounts of female travellers in South Asia and mutiny memoirs by women, to historical records of the city of Mumbai.
What are some trends you are noticing or future trends you are anticipating?
As the online market has got stronger, it has become much easier for our customers from around the world to buy our books as the level of overall trust and comfort in buying online has increased.
We have been working hard to convey our expertise in not only sourcing and selling rare books, but also being able to deliver them to all parts of the world safely using specialist couriers, fully insured.
We are also seeing strong demand for higher quality rare books that often sell for tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds. Historically, these sales used to come from the UK, US and Europe, but in recent years we have seen very serious collectors emerge from markets in Asia and the Middle East. We anticipate this trend to continue.
  What are your thoughts on this present collection and what it would mean to a collector?
While we carry a much larger collection on India, with more than 200 titles currently in stock, in the last six months we have been lucky to acquire some really special items which, in a way, warranted the curation of a dedicated collection, with several rare books on Sikh and Sikhism and several accounts of the Punjab royal courts, and unique military accounts. These form the bulk of this catalogue and would be of special value to collectors with an interest in these fields.
For instance, the three monographs on the ruling families of Punjab, handsomely bound in matching style that we are offering as a collection, is a genuinely rare opportunity to acquire these three highly elusive monographs, each a remarkable work of research written or inspired by Lepel H. Griffin, one of the most colourful officials in 19th century British India. None of these monographs appear on auction records, with the sole exception of a first edition of The Panjab Chiefs, which went through the rooms in 1973.
In terms of uniqueness, there are other titles that would resonate with collectors on many different levels. For instance, Jai Hind. The Diary of a Rebel Daughter of India with the Rani of
Jhansi Regiment is a novelisation of the events written by Captain Lakshmi, the woman appointed by Subhash Chandra Bose as commander of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment — the first ever all-female infantry unit in military history. This book could find a place in collections dedicated to the military history of the sub-continent, female military history, India’s freedom movement or someone with a fascination for the legend of the Rani of Jhansi.
There are many individual books that could appeal to collectors and since launching the catalogue we have already seen several sales that reflect collectors’ varied interests.

Digitisation of manuals for rare books must have its merits and demerits. Could you please throw some light on both and how it will emerge in the future?
All the books we offer for sale are first editions, published copies, in their original states, except when they require light conservation, which we carry out in-house at Peter Harrington. As we hand-pick our stock, we only select books in good to excellent condition. While we catalogue and present our books for sale online and recently through digital catalogues, the books themselves are not digitised.
We believe interactive catalogues of this nature offer a much better opportunity to our international buyers to get a real feel for the book in the absence of being able to visit our store to look at it in person. In the current scenario of limited travel — both domestic and international — our customers have expressed immense satisfaction at being able to scroll through details and additional images of these fine works. The format was also created specifically to be mobile-friendly, as this is where the majority of our customers access our content and we only expect this trend to continue. While we will continue to produce hard-copy catalogues, the feedback we have received to this first immersive digital catalogue has been very encouraging. We are looking forward to being able to produce more specialised interactive catalogues of this nature that would allow us to showcase some of the more nuanced gems on our shelves.",culture
Self-reliance and honing her skills has been the mantra for Calcutta girl Megha Burman in these trying times: Megha Burman," Earlier this year, she made an impression, starring alongside Kangana Ranaut, in Panga. Calcutta girl Megha Burman chatted with The Telegraph about life in lockdown, becoming self-reliant and what this time has taught her.

How’s life been like in the last few months when things have changed so much for all of us?
Life in lockdown is teaching me many lessons. Some days I am at peace and utilise my time well, and some mornings I wake up feeling despair about the future. I am in no position to complain about my existential woes as it’s all trivial in comparison to what others are going through. I feel anxious when I read about our front-line warriors. They are true heroes and deserve more respect.
Initially, I had a ‘quarantine to-do list’, which included a lot of reading, writing and studying for my third-year Urdu exams at Mumbai University. I started learning Urdu for a film with Irrfan Khan, which finally didn’t happen but I pursued the course. It’s such a privilege to understand the language and to be able to read and write it.
But these are unprecedented times and it can be a mixed bag of emotions. So the focus shifted a bit to things that comfort me. I am trying to keep the entertainment light and avoid dystopian content. Also, managing a house is no joke.

Is there anything that you have been doing during this period that you otherwise didn’t have time for?
Cooking has been a big one for me, but I would not call it a skill, yet. Initially, it seemed like a chore and I was spending hours in the kitchen. Early on, I had a mini meltdown making rotis! Now, I plan my meals a day in advance so I don’t waste time. It has become a meditative activity for me, I listen to podcasts or music and have surprisingly become decent and quick.

I turned vegan a few years ago and in this lockdown, I tried my hand at a few vegan recipes which I used to order out. I make my own nut milk ... almond, walnut, cashew and coconut... from scratch, as well as my own nut butters. I also made coconut yoghurt, vegan chocolate, vegan ice cream, brownies and cookies. I cooked this amazing turmeric tofu and coconut curry with chickpeas. Basically, I pretend I’m a scientist and the kitchen is my lab... I experiment and get creative to keep food interesting. I am speaking from a place of privilege, though.
Painting is a new interest. When I heard about Irrfan Sir’s passing, I felt so overwhelmed with grief and didn’t know what to do with those intense emotions trapped within my house, I released it all in a watercolour painting. I felt light after. Since then I sketch and paint regularly by my window, watching the sun set.
I am enjoying reading with no distractions. I read How to be a Woman by Caitlin Moran, On Writing by Stephen King, the biography of (Robert) DeNiro by John Parker and reread Men Without Women by (Haruki) Murakami. I am revisiting the plays I read while in drama school in New York.

What are your top tips for keeping it sane during this period?
Pranayama for 10 to 15 minutes daily, yoga asana practice and meditation are what keep me sane in life in general. I am a certified Hatha Yoga teacher and cannot go a day without my practice. Yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system and helps combat stress and anxiety. I have been doing Ashtanga. Since the lockdown, I started meditating more often. I recommend apps like Calm and Headspace which have guided meditations and are easy to follow. Set aside 10-20 minutes a day to meditate.
On most evenings, I do a 30-minute HIIT session, so I can eat my vegan desserts guilt free. But seriously, breaking a sweat, getting my heart rate up to get a free rush of endorphins has been another important aspect of keeping sane. When I was prepping for Panga, I was sometimes training upto three times a day. I was an equestrian horse rider as a teenager and trained at Fort William Riding School for years and played squash regularly at The Saturday Club. My body loves and craves movement. Plus, it also helps me sleep better at night.
Last but never the least, talking to family every day. My sister who is in Sydney, my father who is in Calcutta and I video-chat every day.

Has this time also made you re-evaluate life?
Absolutely. If this shared global experience doesn’t make us introspect, then what will? Even though I am socially distancing, never have I felt more connected to others across the globe. I am extremely passionate about the environment and sustainability. That’s why I mostly eat a plant-based diet. I used to go for beach clean ups and was shocked to see the amount of single-use plastic embedded in the sand that’s choking marine life. Pre-corona, I was already conscious of reducing my plastic footprint, but this lockdown has taught me that I need to be mindful of food wastage as well. Another very crucial thing this lockdown has taught me is the importance of composting at home. If every household had a compost bin, all the dry peels could turn into compost and feed our little home gardens.
I also realised that I need just the basics to survive. If anything this experience is teaching me is to shop less and buy only what is absolutely necessary. I will henceforth buy sustainable and environmental-friendly goods from our local communities so that the grassroots can benefit too.

The world is on a pause at the moment, but what can we expect from you once you start working actively again?
Work is still on in a different way, but it’s slow. I have been self-taping auditions at home. I was meant to work on a web series and begin shooting in April-end. I am using this time to polish my craft. I’ve been reading books on acting and I am attending online masterclasses on writing, acting and sketching.

Panga has been streaming on the web. What has the feedback been like from people who didn’t catch it in theatres and are streaming it now?
Response and feedback has been pouring in since Panga released, but I get more messages now on my social media accounts. Panga recently aired on STAR Gold and STAR Plus, so it’s been nice to know that more people are getting to watch the film. I get a lot of direct messages mentioning my raid during the Asia Cup and get asked if it really was me who does the cartwheel! When they write in telling me that they watched Panga with their mother and their family enjoyed the film, I feel so proud that I got to be a part of that. Panga is streaming on Hotstar for those who missed it.",culture
"A bark for democracy, anyone?"," A stranger arrives one day — like an intruder into the comfortable world of the middle-class bhadrolok — and turns definitions of civilisation and barbarism on their heads. Manomohan Mitra introduces himself at his niece Anila’s dining table as swalpahari (small-eater) and shorbobhuk (one who eats everything). During a gripping argument, several scenes later in Satyajit Ray’s film Agantuk (The Stranger), when asked if he approves of cannibalism, Mitra clarifies. “I haven’t had the privilege of eating human meat, though I have heard that it is very tasty,” he says, sending shockwaves through the drawing room, where a few minutes earlier Anila had sung Rabindrasangeet, and where tea had been served in bone china cups along with biscuits. Mitra continues, “After all, I am not savage myself, and long before I left home, I had imbibed Shakespeare, Bankim, Michael, Marx, Freud, Rabindranath…”
Ray’s final film comes to my mind every time there are attempts by individuals, groups or the State to judge, sanction, approve of or reject food eaten in certain cultures.
On July 3, the Government of Nagaland announced a ban on the sale of dog meat in the state. “The state government has decided to ban commercial import and trading of dogs and dog markets, and also the sale of dog meat, both cooked and uncooked,” Nagaland chief secretary Temjen Toy wrote on Twitter. The formal ban followed widely shared pictures of dogs in a Dimapur market and BJP leader and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi calling for police action to stop the smuggling of dogs.
The othering of those who consume dog meat is not merely strange to me, it’s arbitrary too. After all, human beings across cultures consume all kinds of meat — from pig, cow, goat, chicken, duck and fish to rabbit, quail, emu, porcupine, rat, camel, bear, boar, deer, turtle and so on.
So why are we talking only about the eating and banning of dog meat, and in what context?

To me, the demand for ban on dog meat coming from fellow meat-eaters is even more disconcerting than if it were a sentimental war cry from vegetarians and vegans.
A compassionate urge to ban dog meat (perhaps to be followed by a total ban on cow meat too, eventually) when goat meat and pig meat are acceptable, is as irrational as it is unacceptable; it speaks of more than merely moral high-handedness, it reeks of fundamental infringements of choice. Hand the government rights to decide what you eat and cannot, and it will most likely prove the thin end of a broad wedge.
Is the twisting of chicken necks leading to squeals in meat markets fine? Fish gills, scales and intestines strewn around, chicken intestines dumped with cats scraping and pawing the entrails, or bleeding goat heads kept on display in butcheries, fine as well? If not, what’s all the fuss over cruelty to dogs?
The question should arise insistently in a country where cow vigilantes have assaulted and lynched scores of Muslims over recent years for allegedly selling and storing beef, with direct and indirect support and sanction — often instigation — of the powers. This, despite the fact that India is one of the biggest exporters of beef and a majority of people associated with the trade are non-Muslims.
The assumption that a large number of Indians are vegetarian is a myth. (In excess of 70 per cent of Indians are non-vegetarians, according to a 2014 survey finding released by the Registrar-General of India.)
The recently spurred indignation and hostility towards dog-meat eaters appears to be a warning that food choices are likely to be even more aggressively attacked in the days to come. In fact, it is symptomatic of a larger tendency to curb the fundamental rights and choices of individuals. This won’t end here. It will move on to diktats on other choices that can or cannot be made. This could be a trigger and a signal to greater authoritarianism, greater scrutiny and greater infringements in the conduct of our lives and the choices we democratically make in pluralist society.
All of it is driven by this mission to “civilise” and “cleanse”. This longing for uniformity is a dangerous concept, justifying as it does disrespect for and non-acceptance of diverse cultures.
It is not sympathy and love that prompts the disgust for consumption of dog meat. If cruelty is the issue, let us not forget that thousands of pet dogs are abandoned every day. Last year, a litter of puppies was bludgeoned to death within the premises of a state-run hospital in Calcutta. Dogs (and cats) are the most commonly kept pets and are considered by humans as relatively more sensitive, friendly, loyal and intelligent than other animals that are killed and consumed. But that cannot be the only reason for demanding the ban on dog meat.
For a majority in India, Nagaland and the rest of the Northeast have always been othered and their diverse culture viewed variously as alien or impossible to interpret. During the Nandigram land movement in 2009, locals in West Bengal’s East Midnapore district protested that members of the central police force’s Naga battalion were eating stray dogs. It is an example of lack of understanding of another culture being used by a certain group to instigate local protestors against security personnel assigned on duty.
India has nearly 195 million undernourished people and shares a quarter of the global hunger burden, with nearly 47 million or four out of 10 children in the country not meeting their full human potential due to chronic under-nutrition or stunting, according to the United Nations. Given this scenario, the government’s primary concern should be to put nutritious meals on the plates of people, because it is in their absence that the poor often resort to consuming rats, snails, odd birds and insects for survival. There is also the right of the poor to the meat of their old livestock if the government is unable to provide them with alternatives.
What is delicacy and choice for some can be a matter of compulsion and survival for others. I have seen the Chinese enjoying fried chicken feet and claws. The crunchy, juicy claws or boiled, fatty pieces of claws in their soups are also popular across Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, Russia, Ukraine. However, in many Indian cities, the poorest of the poor eat chicken claws — bought cheap at a couple of rupees a piece — because they cannot afford the meat.
In Aizawl, I have seen ministers of the state cabinet cooking community meals while heartily popping into their mouths parts of chopped pig head sauteed with ginger, onion, garlic paste and fat. But you are likely to find many die-hard pork eaters who would be averse to the idea of eating pig head. In many parts of the country, especially in northeast India, pork is as popular as beef, eaten during special occasions, especially Christmas. I was lucky to have enjoyed such a platter served at a community church meal.
When it comes to the war cry of banning the consumption of dog meat in the name of cruelty, it is actually majoritarian political philosophy shunning the heterodox. Why so? Because going against what is accepted in the mainstream is perceived as a threat to the homogeneity essential to a monotheistic dictatorial ethos.
What then should inform our choices on consuming meats, what should be our concerns when it comes to determining what meats to consume and how? Our concern should be to protect endangered animals, to provide clear-cut rules on legal slaughterhouses, to ensure hygienic processing and transportation of meat and its products. The rest, frankly, should remain individual choice in a pluralist democracy.",culture
Lane 36 at 40," Ms Violet Stoneham rides home from school in a hand-drawn rickshaw, after teaching Twelfth Night to a class of disinterested students. Home is in a narrow lane of decrepit houses that have seen better times, like the grey-haired Ms Stoneham.
Born in British India — to an Anglo-Indian father who worked, typically, in the railways — Stoneham’s childhood was spent frolicking, with her siblings, in spacious government bungalows. After Independence, most of her family and friends migrated to Australia, Canada, England. But Ms Stoneham decided to stay behind, hoping to integrate with the Indians and continue life as before.
Unfortunately, life was no longer the same. Younger teachers, new cultural values gradually replaced the old order. Writer-director Aparna Sen’s film, 36 Chowringhee Lane, made 40 years ago, captures the tragedy of those who did not “go back home”.

Photographed evocatively by Ashok Mehta, Sen’s directorial debut is a poignant tale of an ageing Anglo-Indian teacher whose life revolved around Shakespeare (even her cat is named Sir Toby after a spirited character from Twelfth Night), tuitions, Christmas carols and tea cakes. Played out by Jennifer Kendal to nuanced perfection, Stoneham’s story is set in Calcutta, 30 years after the British left. A new principal in the school, where she has been earnestly teaching the intricacies of iambic pentameter, demotes her to the lower classes to teach English grammar. It hurts, but Ms Stoneham takes it in her stride and continues with her humdrum, routine life, without revealing the pain within.

Eddy recalls, sadly. “They all went away,” sighs his sister. “They can’t retire me so early,” Eddy continues, grumbling. “I will complain to the king.” To which Ms Stoneham reminds her brother, gently, “There is no king. The British Raj is over.” On the road outside, a protest procession is making its way, screaming slogans as it goes by.
Ms Stoneham’s niece, ditched at the altar by an Indian musician, married one of her community overnight, and migrated to Australia. “Come live with us,” she writes, repeatedly, to her aunt. But Ms Stoneham refrains from joining her as other Anglo Indians who have re-located don’t have happy stories to tell.
So, Ms Stoneham seeks joy in the altered circumstances, giving her all to her students, even letting one of them, Nandita, and her upwardly mobile boyfriend use her home to write a novel.
Alas, when she realises she means nothing to them, that they have cleverly exploited her emotions to use her flat for romantic rendezvous, her stoic back breaks down. All alone on a wide, beautiful road, constructed in British times, she shares her Christmas cake with another loner, a stray dog. The film ends with her reciting lines from Shakespeare, her ultimate solace: “Pray, do not mock me,/I am a very foolish fond old man.
Extremely moving, Ms Stoneham’s plight projects the dilemma of those who didn’t migrate after India became a free nation. A plight that never made it to the headlines, but was quietly borne by countless Ms Stonehams. What inspired Aparna Sen to write their story?
Going back to those times, Sen recounts, “It all started when I was filming as an actor in Bombay, for a regular formula film. We were waiting either for the lighting to be completed or for some actor to arrive, I forget which. Waiting in my makeup room, I started wondering if I was going to be acting in the kind of cinema I did not believe in, for the rest of my career. The very thought was so depressing that I decided to do something else, there and then. I decided to write a short story. Pondering on the subject, I suddenly remembered the old Anglo-Indian teachers in our school. Most of them were very kind and affectionate. As I wrote, to my astonishment, my story started turning into a screenplay. That is how 36 Chowringhee Lane was born.”
Sen recalls meeting one particular teacher before starting her film. “She lived all alone in her apartment. All her nephews and nieces had left India by then. When she fractured
her elbow, it was the neighbours who looked after her. I remember her being very bitter about the school and not attending her farewell function.”
Sen’s multi-award-winning film, whose art director was the veteran Bansi Chandragupta, had a predominance of soft, pastel shades. “I wanted it to resemble a rose that had been kept pressed between the pages of a book for a long time,” she explains.

Out of Asia: Kevin Kwan," There is a scene in the Jon M. Chu directed Crazy Rich Asians where Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) shares a timidly curious and abundantly loving glance with Nick Young (Henry Golding) across the church at an opulent wedding scenario, as his mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh) looks on with disdain. The disapproval of a mother of her son’s beloved, solely for supposed inequality of social status, formed the crux of the witty love story that Kevin Kwan wrote back in 2013, before going on to executive produce the film with Warner Bros. in 2018, grossing somewhere upwards of $237 million worldwide.
When Hollywood had come knocking on his door, Kwan was quick to jump to the idea of a film and also had a clear vision for it. Many meetings with Netflix later, he was convinced of the need for an “old-fashioned cinematic experience in theatres” to do justice to the magnum opus he had written. Representation of Asians in mainstream Hollywood cinema became the keyword in this unprecedented response to a film with an all-Asian cast — a first since The Joyluck Club 25 years before it. The two sequels to the book — China Rich Girlfriend and Rich People Problems — are already in the studios and Kwan has since made it into TIME magazine’s list of 100 most influential people in the world. In between writing for a TV series and moving to Los Angeles from his fave New York, Kwan is ready with his tribute to E.M. Forster’s A Room With A View — a romantic novel, first of a trilogy, Sex and Vanity (Hutchinson; 400pp; Rs 699). On an animated WhatsApp call tying in two exactly opposite time zones, the author spoke to t2oS about his Hollywood experience and his thoughts behind his new book, the rights to which have already been sold to Sony Pictures and SK Global. The ‘crazy rich’ experience
The complete journey of Crazy Rich Asians from book to film was just traversing from one surreal moment to another for Kwan. Selling the rights in 2013, there was a striking dearth of Asian actors he could name who he really wanted to be a part of the film. Except for Michelle Yeoh, the Malaysian actor who starred in visual extravaganzas like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the James Bond flick Tomorrow Never Dies. “We even considered a few Indian directors who are doing such great work when suddenly, Jon Chu’s name came up. My initial thought was that he is much too famous to do this. He makes these $300-million G.I. Joe films, but then guess what happened?” (laughs!)
Kwan was deeply involved in the production process, constantly sending reference pictures for set designs and costumes, some straight from his personal archives documenting the affluence of his own family two generations before him. His great-grandfather Oh Sian Guan was one of the founders of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Singapore’s oldest bank. While every scene in the film reflected his vision, Kwan comments upon his first experience of entering the set. “I was jet-lagged and had just reached Malaysia from New York and they put me in a van and took me straight to the set where Jon was filming the big party scene. While driving up the hills, I see these
18-wheeler trucks and I start counting them. There were hundreds. I felt like I was crashing a party that was in my book when Jon grabbed me and took me up the stairs to a table that had framed pictures of my grandparents. I felt that he had put my ancestors on the set and that I was being guided by the spirits amidst them.” Writing about women from Kwan’s ‘place of truth’
Kwan attributes his deep understanding of women to this force of association he feels with his family, having grown up in a family that was matriarchal. “My grandmother always ruled the roost in the household and I have always been exposed to very strong female characters. My Cantonese nanny was a helicopter mom and my mother too was a formidable character. The men? They were mostly silent,” he laughs. Growing up with two brothers meant that Kwan craved and succeeded in finding ‘sister figures’ at every juncture of life. While we understand the emotional connect, we can’t help but wonder about the deep fashion connect, as he puts a bride in his latest book in a “white duchesse satin strapless gown with delicate pleats just below the bodice, mirrored by pleats at the back that flared dramatically into a long billowing train”. This dress was an exact replica of Audrey Hepburn in a Givenchy in 1955, we find out and are compelled to ask! “I am actually not that knowledgeable about fashion. All the fashion in the first three books came with a lot of help from the women in my life,” he chimes. From Lucie Churchill in Sex and Vanity to Rachael Chu in Crazy Rich Asians, his women are culturally rooted to their Asian heritage and are made of all the right ingredients of intellect, talent, looks and gravitas that form the recipe for a perfect strong female protagonist. “I never set out to write stories about strong female characters but that is how they emerged in the end. Astrid (Gemma Chan), the character in Crazy Rich Asians, was supposed to be the protagonist’s cousin and a very small side character, but she emerged and how!” he exclaims.
Disassociating from the old to arrive at the new
There was a need to do things differently for Kwan when he embarked upon his latest novel. All his previous books were set in Asia. So, this time, he decided to take his readers to the small island of Capri and later to New York. “I didn’t want to be typecast as an author who only writes about rich Asian families. I wanted to evolve with my style and you will notice that it’s a subtler book, which is not so ensconced in the bling and glamour of the money.” That, in no way, means that Lucie Churchill in Sex and Vanity, Kwan’s version of Forster’s Lucy, is not privileged. While his Rachel fought her lover’s family’s privileged, closed mindset, Lucie’s fight is more internal. “I wanted to write something simpler that ultimately makes people laugh and brings them joy,” he adds.
Lucie is a half-Asian (Hapa), American girl who often gets asked “which side of the family she feels more at home with”. This Hapa experience is a contradiction of sorts as the inner values of the culture oftentimes conflict with the Anglo outer environment. However, for Kwan, documenting that turmoil feels almost effortless. “The challenge of the book was to make her authentic. Because I am not half-Asian, it was imperative that I do justice to her story,” Kwan says of his character born from the ‘many, many, many different interviews’ he conducted of friends to understand this narrative.
His observations on the ‘colonial hangover’ in Asian countries, which get reflected in their obsession for all things ‘Western’, somehow find their way into his books just as it does in a free-flowing conversation with him. There is a sense of relatability when he speaks of kids in Asian countries scrambling to be best friends with the only biracial kid in the class. Through a tool as influential as a romantic comedy that predominantly attracts a female audience, these are the exact inherent biases that he tries to satirically highlight.

If Forster had Instagram
The tale is simple and as close an ode to Forster as it could be with a room with a view of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Capri, the little island in Italy. Lucie Churchill falls in irresistible love-hatred for George Zao at a wedding in Capri amidst unfathomable riches. Many years later, after life has moved on and Lucie is betrothed to a clumsy billionaire Cecil, a chance meeting with George from the past overturns her life. “The way Forster addresses class really interested me and helped put a perspective to Lucie’s narrative,” he says of this love triangle. In any love triangle, the need to demonise one party becomes almost imperative to justify the love between the other two. However, negative emotions are not that rampant and one is bound to feel equal parts pity and disdain for Kwan’s Cecil. “He maybe a snob but you can see the root of that snobbery and that is what makes Cecil more humane,” he says. Picturesque Capri comes alive, almost like a character in itself in the book and forms an ode to the island that has won the author’s heart over the years, where he has spent many a summer exploring every nook and cranny.
“It’s not all jet-set, bling bling. I spent years observing so many hormonal Lucies running loose on the island, having summer romances that they don’t plan when they decide to vacation there with their parents,” he laughingly adds. The trilogy he has planned will not be the conventional kind and each book will have a city he absolutely adores, with New York being the first one followed by London and then Paris.
Building a satire with a rigorous writing process
Kwan’s books have always commanded a satirical angle and, in his latest, he introduces every character with their schools in brackets — ‘Mordecai von Ephrussi (Wetherby/ Dragon/ Harrow/ Magdalene College, Oxford)’, he writes. “I wanted it to be hilarious and this is something I have observed in my New York days, where complete personal stories were unearthed within minutes of introduction through a rant on school snobbery. It is almost a way of socially placing you and I found that hilarious. Especially when I went to a public school and got a damn good education for $2,000 while they paid $70,000!”
These little observations contribute to the nuanced understanding of his characters, whose privileged reality is very different and aspirational from an unachievable point of view for most.
“Writing is a lot like working out, you have to be disciplined about it. I do spend a lot of time thinking about my books and then the writing begins,” says Kwan, who stops his emails and completely goes underground when he starts writing.
Reading and watching regimen
Kwan has been asked to watch Amazon Prime’s Made in Heaven. “It is the Indian version of Crazy Rich Asians, I was told,” and we can’t help but agree with him! Copious amounts of Netflix binge form a part of the existence of Kwan, who is currently watching Dark. Mindy Kaling’s Indian-American teenage story Never Have I Ever has caught his attention for being “all heart”. As he speaks fondly of Indian directors like Mira Nair and Shekhar Kapur, his association with popular culture shines through his vibrant personality. Gurinder Chadha’s Beecham House is also on top of his list because of his “love for all things India”. He is reading Notes on a Silencing by Lacy Crawford, who he is interviewing next week for a book event.
Reluctant to say bye to a fun-filled conversation that effortlessly goes into an hour-long chat, he is ecstatic to have been able to talk about his book and his writing. “Most people just want to talk about Crazy Rich Asians and while that’s fine, there is so much more that I would love to discuss about my writing.” A breath of fresh air in the midst of the pandemic is what marks Kevin Kwan and his latest offering that one can effortlessly imagine playing out on the big screen. And we can’t wait to find ourselves transported to London in the sequel.",culture
Embrace your femininity for a more inclusive living. Two men and a woman show us how," Stylist Ankita Banerjee met Jonathan Marchese, an Italian freelance illustrator on his recent trip to India, at Trincas, and the two bonded over hair! “He was there with his friends and he came and complimented my hair and I was like, I love your hair too. He was wearing kohl and his hair was dyed red. He had that feminine vibe and that power within him,” said Ankita. And, a collaboration idea was born. When The Telegraph caught up with Jonathan later, he was ecstatic about the shoot. “I really want to thank The Telegraph for giving me the opportunity to express my thoughts and feelings. As soon as I arrived in India I felt so bad about the LGBTQ community situation and I wanted to do something for our community. I’m close to the people who are fighting in India, like all over the world, for their rights to be human,” he said. A chat with The Telegraph. 

What was the high point of the shoot for you?
We played a lot with the looks and we mixed the stylist’s outfits with mine. For me the highest point was the green sari look. As soon as I got to India I started looking for my sari and finally I found it in Varanasi. What an effort! I’m a so happy because it’s exactly like I wanted. Precious and special without being too cheeky, it’s a matter of silent luxury.

What did you like about the looks?
Of course the no-gender attitude and the bold accessories!

What is great about touching base with your feminine side?
I’ve been feeling this way all my life. When I was younger it was difficult because I used to hide this side. My room was my secret and safe space where I could express my wholeness. It was a very painful period until I realised that I was killing the whole me, so I started expressing myself without any inhibition. I became full power! It is all about connecting with both your feminine and masculine sides. It makes you feel great and powerful. It expands your mind and makes you empathetic. Stereotypes are the death of humanity. Minds with no limits or boundaries can explore the truth of this world. The greatest thing about touching base with my feminine side is that I feel more human.

What are your favourites from your feminine closet?
My closet is a carnival! It is made of many selected vintage and made-to-measure pieces and other very dramatic, theatrical ones. I love colours and precious natural fabrics. There’s no difference between feminine and masculine clothes. I love silk and lace shirts. I also love skirts, corsets and silk scarves. Of course I have many wigs that I usually wear when I go out. Jewels are fundamental. I prefer headpieces and necklaces. They make every look special and fit my personality. I usually mix tailored masculine looks with feminine touches: brooches, silk scarves and sometimes heels!

Have you ever been ridiculed?
I am ridiculed every day. Firstly, I never take myself too seriously but every time someone tries to ridicule, I explain to them that what they see is natural and simple. I show myself as I am. We just see the ‘normality’ from a different point of view. I really think that till we see the world from just one point of view we will never develop. The normative way of living won’t suit us forever. We are in a very powerful moment. There’s a strong feeling of freedom all around the world. We must ride this wave. All these concerns about how we should wear or behave according to our sexuality is stupid. It puts you in the cage of comfort zone and homologation.

What would be your message for all the men reading this?
I want to ask them some questions: What really is masculinity? What are the characteristics? How should a man look like and behave? A ‘true man’ is still a ‘true man’ with a skirt! We always hear about toxic masculinity but men are victims as well. We live in a patriarchal world, men make rules but they don’t understand that the more they impose the rules the more they get affected by them. My message for all men and for all people in general is: Love yourself. Love other people. Be curious about diversity. Never stop playing. Look at the world like a child. Don’t be scared. Don’t hide your true being in a closet. Don’t suppress yourself before society really does it. 
  The bright and young Udit Pandey is an aspiring model with promise. Shooting for The Telegraph was the high point for him and we absolutely loved his cool confidence and the ability to mould himself for each look.

What was the high point of the shoot for you?
Well, I was walking out of my college campus when I got a call from Ankita and she told me I am cast for a shoot with t2. I feel blessed to do this shoot because back when I started modelling, being skinny and androgynous wasn’t celebrated a lot. I stuck to myself and never changed and today I am glad being myself helped me land this shoot.

What did you like about the looks?
Each and every look was very different. The outfits were exquisite.

What is great about touching base with your feminine side?
Well, as a model your walk is something that defines you the best and am proud to embrace both the man and the woman in me, which is of course my mom and dad, when I walk.

What are your faves from your feminine closet?
I don’t believe clothes and shoes have a gender. But if I have to answer that I’d say the black boots I own with a six-inch heel.

Have you ever been ridiculed?
A lot of times actually but am glad the business I chose made my skin more tough than before. One fine evening I was walking down the road and all of a sudden I saw a guy who was with two of his girlfriends and he was trying to imitate my walk and mock me, which was really weird because they made me feel like as if I was doing something hilarious.

What was your reaction?
Well, I approached the guy and told him, if you really want to imitate my walk, you better do it right and I taught him my walk then and there and turned out he made a fool of himself when he wanted to make fun of me.

What would be your message for all the men reading this?
Our lives are too short to not be ourselves in this lifetime. You cannot make people happy if you yourself are not. So ask ask yourself, are you happy? Are you the real you or just an illusion you made for the society?",culture
What matters is what you do with what you have. Keep life simple — Luke Coutinho," Keeping healthy is not rocket science for integrative lifestyle medicine and life coaching pro Luke Coutinho. Those among his 234k followers on Instagram would know that. Simple habits and age-old traditions are integral to the way he sees life. And, that was precisely what he reiterated on Wednesday afternoon over a Zoom webinar — a Prabha Khaitan Foundation initiative “Kitaab”, in association with Ehsaas Women of India and presented by Shree Cement Ltd — that saw the launch of Luke Coutinho’s new book The Magic Immunity Pill: Lifestyle, co-authored with Shilpa Shetty Kundra. “It is an e-book that you can download for free,” said Luke, for whom health is “non-negotiable”. Extracts from the session...

The genesis of the book...
Even before the Covid-19 situation, the fundamental principle of our practice has always been immunity. After the Covid situation struck us, we were bombarded with questions every single day. A lot of them didn’t even know what immunity is. I thought the best way to reach the masses was to put it all down into a book. Then I reached out to Shilpa and I asked her if she would contribute with the yoga part, the asanas and the pranayama. Within two minutes we decided to put it together.

The pillars of immunity...
Nutrition that suits your body type. We need the right kind of physical activity. Quality sleep is important. Our emotional wellness is also very important. By that I mean chronic stress and chronic emotional issues.

The dangers of self-medication...
A lot of people are sick today because they have self-medicated themselves over the years. Everyone should understand there is a reason why there are doctors.

The importance of vitamin D…
This has always been important. We can get sunlight if we can. If you can’t, then you must call up your doctor and get a prescription for vitamin D. Technically you need to get a supplement if you are deficient. Now most of them can’t get tests done, so the doctor usually gives them a prescription and advises them to take it once a month. It is a very low dose and it will maintain you and not let you get into toxicity.

Beating stress...

Overcoming stress is a personal decision for everyone. At the end of the day, there is one fundamental concept of stress. You can’t do anything if it exists in your life. The only thing you can do is prevent it from affecting you. Some people during this time are learning new skills and trying to figure out an action plan. Some people are just wallowing in the stress expecting their lives to get better by not doing anything about it. Stress and fear are wasted emotions.
Meditation, the spiritual path and prayers are all grounding mechanisms. If you don’t have them, your mind is going to be pulled in all directions. When you pray, pray with faith and belief and then surrender.
I can’t open any of my clinics and I can feel bad about that... my business is going to collapse, or my mind is already thinking of 10 different ways to run and build without a clinic. There is no magic pill to get rid of stress.

Mentoring and parenting kids...
This (staying at home) is normal. Sometimes they go to 15-20 parties a month. That was abnormal. This is a good grounding experience for most people. There are ups and downs in life. Inner connection is important.
I ordered about five kilos of organic mud and I put it into a big container and she (daughter Tyanna) plays in it. Even just playing in that mud for 10-15 minutes can increase the microbes for your immune system. We have to measure what overprotective means.

Most importantly...
There is one thing I have learnt in life. It doesn’t matter how much you have. What matters is what you do with what you have. Keep life simple. At the end of the day, what matters is how good you feel.",culture

Prateek Kuhad on the making of Kasoor," To be honest, I knew people were going to like this video. From the day I read the pitch for this video, I knew this was going to be great and I was very excited about it. But I didn’t expect it to go as nuts as it has,” is Prateek Kuhad’s honest admission about the music video of Kasoor, which has already notched up over a million views since its release on June 30.
The Delhi-based singer-songwriter who enjoys cult status — riding on hits such as cold/mess, Raat Raazi, Kho Gaye Hum Kahan and Tum Jab Paas — has used Kasoor’s video to give us an eclectic assimilation of emotions surrounding love, sourced from a mix of his fans and friends. This mix covers an interesting milieu, starting with fans from his mailing list wearing a cold/mess sweatshirt to familiar faces like Jim Sarbh, Kavya Trehan and Mallika Dua. Each of them react to prompts and reminders of things such as first kisses, hardest break-ups and a person they are missing, which are all then strung together with the song. “I think the questions are so relevant that there will hardly be anybody who has not experienced at least one of those things, which is probably why everyone can relate to the video,” said Prateek, as we caught up with him over the phone. Excerpts from a chat with The Telegraph.

What gave you this idea to involve your fans and friends for Kasoor’s music video?
We wanted to put out Kasoor last year and we reached out to Jugaad (Jugaad Motion Pictures), who are the same people behind cold/mess. We sent them the song last year around July-August and then Dar (Gai) came back to me with three ideas, out of which two were more traditional music-video ideas with a narrative and actors in it but the third one is what the video is — asking a bunch of people these questions and making a video out of their reactions. I was immediately excited by this idea. In contrast to cold/mess, which was very personal and autobiographical, Kasoor was not that much of a personal song — it was more of a love song that I wrote and is pretty much what the listener takes away from it. Last year was crazy with the tour and the scale was massive so we put the video on the back-burner. When everybody got back to working a couple of months ago, we decided to do this video. The good thing was that I already had a strong email subscriber base that we had been building for the last six-seven years with a good 15,000 people on it. So we could send a bunch of emails out and get responses for this video.

How did you go about the logistics for this?
It was all very well-planned. We basically sent everybody a video with instructions about how to place the camera and just respond to the questions. We had just asked them to not watch the video till it was over to get real reactions. There were a few more questions than you see in the video actually but it is basically a three minute-long video with Kasoor playing in the background and people reacting to these prompts. It was a three-day process as we gave them a deadline. There was a lot of pre-production involved like sending out the emails and getting everyone’s consent regarding being in the video. We got back around 500 videos but we couldn’t fit all of them in. I reached out to some of my friends and asked them myself. But the bulk of it was made up of fan reactions.

How did you shoot your parts for this video?
Last year when we were planning this, my parts in the video were supposed to be shot properly in a studio with lighting and done professionally. But we could not do that so I just shot my parts at home with the help of my girlfriend — with tripods and a hand-held digital camera. We had Dar and Aditya (Varma), who is the cinematographer, on Zoom the whole time. They were looking at the frames in my house through the call and checking the videos immediately.
The good thing is that 95 per cent of the video is just with fans and friends. Last year, we had talked about having actors in it too but the reactions we received from the submissions were so real that we did not need to have anybody else. I am barely there in it and only my parts are shot and planned, that too to break the monotony of it. In general, I don’t get too involved in the music videos. With Kasoor, it was easier because we were just looking at these reactions and that’s something that Jugaad did completely on their own. So for me, it was just shooting my bits, which took three hours each for two days and was quite simple.

So how was it reuniting with the cold/mess production team for Kasoor?
The whole reason we did Kasoor with Jugaad is also because I had such a great time working with them during cold/mess. It’s rare to find people who pay a lot of attention to detail and all of them are perfectionists and really finicky. For example, when we were trying to pick the font for the video, they went through nine different designers and I must have seen 50 font options. I am also picky and they are also picky, so it really works. I am sure editing this video must have been a nightmare, especially to pick out little moments from so many videos and then put them together! We spotted Kia and Cosmos girl Ritwika Pal in the latest Prateek Kuhad video for Kasoor and asked her what it was like to shoot her bit for it. “It was actually a very simple process. They mailed us a video with messages. And we had to record ourselves and send. Must have been a nightmare for the editor. The messages really tucked at your heart. Like it took you from a very sad memory to a very awkward or happy memory in matter of seconds. So I was sitting alone in my room, smiling, frowning, making faces, dancing and sending flying kisses to my phone screen,” said Ritwika. “It was the range of emotions of the people that really struck me after watching the completed video. Because what people might feel about the same experience can really be different from yours,” she added. ",culture
DJ Spryk on curating his first compilation of Red Bull Premieres," For Tejas Nair, aka DJ Spryk, it is important to bring forward the story that usually accompanies music. The Mumbai-based visual artiste, producer and label owner also conducts radio shows. And now he has curated the first compilation under Red Bull Premieres, a monthly project featuring different independent artistes from around the country. For the first edition, Spryk has put together the sounds of Tienas, Voctronica, Okedo and Ofro, and ADK. A chat with the curator whose show can be heard on RedBull.com
 
How was Red Bull Premieres conceived?
I’ve been running this online radio show under my label Skip A Beat where I’ve been discovering and presenting all sorts of electronic and independent music that is being made across India. This ranges from original music, singer-songwriters, hip-hop collectives, rappers and electronic music producers as well as music that expands over different genres. So this has been on for three years and I’ve been on the Red Bull roster of artistes for quite some time. A month and a half back I had a chat with their team and they told me that they would like to work on a platform together where we could showcase new and unreleased music from independent Indian acts. It worked out well because of the radio show and label and because I am contacted by new musicians with their new music, demos and samples. That’s how it sort of started.

What was the artiste selection process for the compilation?
It depends. I accept demos through email and social media channels. But I also spend a lot of time going through  soundcloud.com,  mixcloud.com, bandcamp.com and many other platforms, looking for music myself. In this case some of the demos fit really well into the concept and some were sent to me specifically as their releases were around the corner. So the team and I were listening to the music and trying to understand what the story is. The most important part of Red Bull Premieres is that the story behind the music has to come to life. So all the tracks that you hear have a distinctive story behind them... about how their music came together or how the artistes came together.

We believe you have some fresh content coming up?
I am working on this audio-visual show… I like to call it an electronic music adventure, which is about tracing and taking influences from the evolution of mankind and our relationship with technology and how it has influenced different aspects of our lives and decisions that we make. The show came together through a collaboration with Magnetic Fields festival… when they approached me for the festival and asked me to build the show out and present for the first time at their last edition in 2019. And that was supposed to be the unveiling of the show and it came together really well. That was the show I was going to take on tour and the plan was to release bits of the album as we did more shows. But since that’s not happening I’m building on a structure that can deliver the experience digitally. I can’t give too many details at the moment but it’s not the traditional camera-and-soundcard experience. It’s far more immersive, it has a mixed media approach to it, there’s a lot of trace-media elements to it, there’s a lot of film, music, objects, themes….

Powered By PLAYSTREAM Fubu by Tienas: I found his band FTS on YouTube a couple of years ago while searching for new material for my radio show. He went on to drop a mixtape on Azadi Records that cemented the fact that he is in a league of his own. I absolutely love the way he is able to use his music and wordplay to deliver not just punchlines but address complex subjects.
Yaaruda Tamizhan by Ofro and Adk: Ofro is a prolific independent music producer from Chennai who has been working with various styles of music for many years now. We both spent about four years together in Australia, studying, travelling and making music. He’s spent the last few months working with a Tamil rapper named ADK, based in Singapore. They are both widely regarded as some of the freshest artistes in the Tamil diaspora.
Impulse by Okedo: Their music is rich and showcases a lot of depth in skill as well as narrative. We had the chance to share the stage not too long ago when they were opening for me at the Magnetic Fields South Stage in December. A few months later while I was doing an Instagram live stream listening to demos for my label, they sent me an unreleased track called Impulse.
Seven by Voctronica: Voctronica is a one-of-a-kind a capella band that is packed with incredibly talented musicians, an infectious energy in their style of performance and they manage to do what they do without any instruments at all. ",culture
The future of the music industry? Play it by the ear," Club gigs and parties may not be a priority during Covid-19 but it is a source of earning for millions of people connected with the music industry. According to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry’s (IFPI) 2020 Global Music Report, global music sales grew for the fifth consecutive year in 2019, garnering a total revenue of $20.2 billion. But with Covid-19 cancelling club gigs, music festivals, tours and shows, will it bring the music industry’s lucky streak to an end? Maybe not, as streaming accounted for more than half of all label revenues for the first time last year.
But if we shift our attention to local artistes and DJs, people who have performed in clubs in the city or are listed as “opening acts” for events, it’s probably a time to worry. Live performances played a huge role in getting money into their pockets and now a renowned band from the city is facing a loss — in potential earnings — of at least Rs 20 lakh.
More than asking “when can we go clubbing” and “when’s the next music festival”, relevant questions would be: “What’s the next step? How will music events make up for losses? What is the new normal?” We asked and this is what we were told.
The old ‘normal’
“I was travelling almost every weekend. It was a packed schedule for me,” said techno artiste Ash Roy. Almost every club had an artiste flying down from different parts of the world every other weekend. And this was at a time when underground subgenres, such as techno and experimental, were taking over, besides hip-hop and Bollywood of course. Names such as Greg Hilight, Liquid Ross, The Spindoctor, Eeemus, Todh Teri and Matan Caspi were down in the city to play before the lockdown took place and the discussions of bringing down other artistes were taking place too. Moreover, the first wave of the ‘Goa party season’ had come to an end when the lockdown was announced, which is when event organisers and promoters organise gigs and tours with the artistes (from around the world) present in Goa. But, of course, there were other plans.

“A lot of artistes, like Vibe Tribe, VirtuaLight, Hypnoise wanted to play in Calcutta. DJ Tristan’s India tour got cancelled,” said Vikrant Jaiswal aka DJ Outlaw, a psy-trance act from the city. Although the lockdown has taken a big toll on the music industry, it has had an even bigger toll on psy-trance. A few years ago every club had a psy-trance event but in recent years there has been a lull. “I’ve spoken to a few organisers from different cities and most of them are saying that there is no chance for
psy-trance,” he said.
When the lockdown was declared, it caused uncertainty panic, especially for self-employed artistes. Other than club gigs and festivals, even corporate and wedding gigs have been cancelled. The peak time for summer season normally begins in the first week of June and continues all the way to October.
City-based DJ Vicky Metharamani normally works 25-plus days a month during this season but it has all “zeroed down”. “DJs haven’t earned properly in three months and the next few months also look dry. I had bookings till January, in places outside India as well,” he said. But it turns out that all the 35 confirmed bookings, with advance payments already made to the DJ, had to be cancelled. Not only does money play a problem with the lockdown but it will also be long before that old club experience and vibe returns. DJ Sanjay Dutta had to shelve a few of his gigs and until the concept of a music gathering does not come back, it will not be the same. “The concept of clubbing is about people coming together and exchanging thoughts. That’s the essence. You can play around with the concept but it won’t be the same. For example, you can have drive-in parties but the charm is gone,” he said.
Moreover, freelance musicians, who are new to the scene, are currently earning nothing. Some resident DJs are still getting their share of payment from their respective clubs but some freelance DJs are given gigs without any formal agreements.
“A huge part of the business conducted goes without contracts, agreements, there’s no standardised guidelines. Within organisations people have protocols but as an industry there seems to be no norms, no standards…” said Spryk from Mumbai when asked about the live music ecosystem.
This makes life difficult for live musicians as there are no associations to resolve disputes, there is no equal opportunity and no one’s keeping a check on whether people are being inclusive or fair in the way people get paid, given how much time they’ve put in.
Veterans can still bank on savings for the coming months but for new artistes, times are tough because they’d be earning only a few thousands, some of which remains unpaid and delayed. Many musicians still have pending payments due to the lockdown. DJ RishiBoy says, “Artistes have not been paid and they have been given Covid-19 as the reason, which I believe is stupid from the owner’s side because once a customer walks into a club, he or she pays his cash and consumes whatever he needs. So why do DJs get paid so late? It is beyond my comprehension and something I always wanted to know. DJs, on the other hand, don’t really open up about it just to get more gigs and this is how owners use them.”

Online action
With few public venues available for the music scene, most artistes have taken their talents online… to at least earn something. This sure has taken a good turn for live musicians and producers as they are able to share their music to a huge crowd. While some are still going live using their (social media) accounts, many are also creating events and line-ups for which a minimum fee needs to be paid for entry. Although most of these events are linked with charity, some are just for the sake of entertainment.
TopCat CCU in Topsia and Skinny Mo’s Jazz Club on Manoharpukur Road are two properties that were among the first to start monetised gigs in Calcutta. One duo that has been a step ahead is Parekh & Singh. “Nischay and I don’t stay in the same city, so almost all our work is done online. We only meet to play. The lockdown didn’t affect our work or our creative process but it made us more active online,” said Jivraj Singh. Things seem to have fallen in place for Aswekeepsearching as well. They had worked on an instrumental album which was set to launch in February but eventually launched on April 17, which is also drummer Sambit Chatterjee’s birthday.
Although monetised gigs provide a “something is better than nothing” situation for live acts, it has taken a different turn for DJs. Due to copyright issues, social media platforms are muting or taking down DJ sets when a song used is recognised to be under a label.
“So does that mean I can’t use someone else’s track? That’s what a DJ does! And I buy all my music, so it’s not like the label is getting zero credit,” says Aban Shetty aka DJ Aban or Ban-Dit from Mumbai. But a lot of DJs seem to be opposing the idea of going live because a proper revenue model is missing; everyone is doing it and there’s no fun watching “a person push buttons for an hour”. But going live also opens up opportunities, such as being noticed by DJ Suketu. The Bolly DJ hosts Discovery Thursday sessions where he gives a shout-out to young talent after viewing their live sessions. Many DJs have also collaborated with visual jockeys to give their viewers something to watch while they mix their set.

Music and more
Although it is a tough phase, the pandemic has also given artistes ample time to work on their other talents and qualities. Musicians are teaching themselves visual art, conducting podcasts, giving lessons and more. Aban Shetty is currently hosting podcast sessions that deal with techno, psy-trance and their subgenres. City-based Jazzleen Kaur was about to start her academy but plans to take DJing classes for people instead. Sambit Chatterjee of Aswekeepsearching has been hosting classes and masterclasses on his private page on Instagram (@SambitCShow) where entry is only given to those who sign up for it. DJ Spryk, who has his own label, radio show and studio, notices a sudden surge of interest in podcast productions, music for movies, videos and animated pieces. Some musicians, however, are switching careers and settling for corporate jobs and family businesses.

The way forward
When asked what the way forward is, musicians and DJs have no definite answer. According to Ash Roy, the virus is a fear that has been put into people’s minds. “Authorities need to realise that partying is a way of release and understand the importance of nightlife. We have never got that support. It helps in revenue and alcohol sales,” he says. The producer who is currently residing in Berlin says that the city survives on tourism and entertainment.
DJ Vicky Metharamani says that small weddings are still taking place and he hopes that by October things will open up. “Some places have already opened up but are not serving alcohol,” he says. He also advises other DJs to start working on their music production. DJ RishiBoy believes that now is a good time to work on sets and skills rather than worrying about how to earn money.
“I believe the audience will have to follow a new dress code with their masks,” laughs Aban Shetty. The club party scene will never be the same as there will be fewer people, although silent parties could be a way forward. But Aban has one request: “No guest list! Please pay for your entry.”
According to DJ Spryk, a major step the industry can take, even if it’s at a grassroot level, is formalising the structure of how business is conducted. For him it’s not only about bringing content to people but also about monetising it for their livelihood. “It’s going to be the same as putting together an actual show where revenue is the backbone of the music scene. Anyone with a camera and sound card can potentially do a live stream but it’s the content that matters,” he said.
For Jazzleen Kaur the way forward is via personal gigs through Zoom for anniversaries, birthday parties and other celebrations. Jivraj Singh believes that livestreams are probably not the future but it definitely adds to the mediums. According to him, the indie live music scene was already a hard place to make money but taking to social media has helped them create a deeper connection with fans and has helped in receiving feedback from demos that they launch at times.
Sambit says that the future is not bleak for the music industry. “This is a change, you either adapt or fall behind.” With the lockdown no one is looking at how one can get a variety of music at home; there is no drinking and driving involved… this is the only way to be safe and keep others around you safe. “This pandemic is teaching people how to use gadgets. People are evolving with the situation,” he says.
What about losses? “Who will compensate for my personal loss? My father (Pandit Subhen Chatterjee) had to cancel two world tours and I had to cancel 19 gigs within the first week of the lockdown. At the end of the day we will get everything back other than the time we have now. So we might as well feel for each other rather than point fingers.”
In these uncertain times, all music lovers can do is support musicians. Support your local scene, share and buy your favourite musician’s work, clear their payments and collaborate on different projects.

The quintessential kurta gets a makeover in a Rina Singh x UNIQLO collab," A kurta is a kurta is a kurta. Not quite. One look at designer Rina Singh’s line of kurtas for UNIQLO’s 2020 Spring/Summer Kurta Collection, the fresh rawness and stark simplicity seems in sync with the spirit of decluttering, a predominant mood right now.
The Telegraph caught up with Rina on the collaboration.

How did the collaboration with UNIQLO happen?
For many years now, I have been retailing internationally with my brand and have been building a pulse on the customer landscape across demographics, their take on fit and the merits of design in terms of functionality and acceptability. During one of the design exhibitions we were showcasing at, I happened to meet the head of R&D at UNIQLO, Yuki Katsuta.
It was after a few brainstorming sessions and meetings that we decided to collaborate to push forth UNIQLO’s idea of LifeWear with a product that would be accessible for all. The kurta has been India’s day dress for years now — it is timeless, extremely democratic and functional, aligning it perfectly with the brand’s philosophy. It can be layered, worn with or without jackets, scarves or trousers. The possibilities were endless.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM What were your first thoughts when this collaboration offer came about?
I feel that UNIQLO introducing this product around the time of their India launch last year was an intelligent understanding of consumer behaviour. Through this collection they aspired to create a line that embodies refined elegance and effortlessness for the progressive women, regardless of age, race, culture, or belief.

You are inspired by Amrita Sher-Gil’s paintings. What were your references? Do any of these paintings resonate with you on a personal level?
For our second Summer 2020 collection, I was inspired by Hungarian-Indian painter Amrita Sher-Gil. I believe that her modern interpretation of art, her personality, her take on India in a colour sensibility that brought together the East and the West were truly ahead of their time. While her painting style was influenced by European and Impressionist schools of thought, the projection of subjects and landscapes in her paintings kept her Indian sentiment alive.
Some of Sher-Gil’s popular artworks such as ‘The Three Girls’, ‘The Little Girl In Blue’ and self-portraits piqued our interest and will definitely resonate through this collection of dailywear essentials. The colour palette draws on the rich hues from her canvas and are complemented with hand-painted botanical motifs.
My effort was to visualise and create a modern-day wardrobe inspired by one of the greatest avant-garde artists of the 20th century and her pioneering take on portraiture.

How is this collection an extension of your DNA?
Through my previous collections, I have systematically worked towards introducing garments that are rooted and indigenous, whilst maintaining a contemporary and atypical look. From the very beginning of our association, there was a very distinctive synergy and clarity in the way UNIQLO and I collaborated.
The idea was to have a linear, simplistic and monotonal approach as opposed to the traditional treatment of kurta. Design adaptations were made to introduce the kurta as a wearable and universally adaptable day dress that could stand on its own anywhere in the world.

We like how you have deconstructed the definition of a ‘kurta’. Can you tell us a bit about your approach?
We envisioned a layered outfit that could be worn with other everyday coordinates across all age groups, be it a 50-year-old woman or a young girl at 24 years. Given its versatility with sizes, shapes and material, we believe that the UNIQLO kurta is a democratic shape that could be offered to women across the world and its innate functionality was a step in that direction.
Reflecting on our modern approach to tradition, we incorporated items with blends of Indian slub yarn rayon, linen, and other materials, and employed dobby weaves to replicate the handwoven feel. The collection was built with tunics, dresses, pants and stoles. We incorporated premium linen dresses that proved popular in the previous season in addition to summer gingham checks, solid linen, lightweight and airy, printed cotton voile and floral prints. Classic functional stripes are used for outerwear and trousers. Hues of yellow, pink, emerald were picked for a bright and energetic take on summerwear.

Fashion has always been minimal for you. Now more than ever, do you think, we need to adopt this approach?
I wouldn’t say that I dwell on minimalism, however I do emphasise on ‘less is more’ philosophy. In Indian design and textiles we do use an excess of colour, pattern, and rendering details, I try not to overdo each detail and I think that makes for the minimal element in my work. I also believe functionality is important. Anything irrelevant might not find a lot of space in people’s lives in the uncertain times we are living in… so design and fashion in particular will have to subscribe to relevance and functionality.

Who is this collection for?
This collection is made for a larger global audience. There are different styles based on one’s individual preference, and the idea is to incorporate these coordinates in your daily wardrobe, in the way you deem fit. For summer styling, I would recommend that these styles can be paired easily with everyday trousers or denim and coordinated with a summer jacket or scarf. One can also experiment with layering by wearing the buttoned shapes open with an easy trouser and a camisole top. Dresses can be styled with high-waist belts for those dressing up, and airy culottes underneath for those dressing down.",culture
Madame Gandhi delivers a message of empowerment through her latest video," When you become the image of your own imagination, it’s the most powerful thing you could ever do,” RuPaul once said. The Pride Month came to an end on June 30 and Madame Gandhi, multi-talented artiste, percussionist, producer and activist, celebrated the month with a banger. She dropped the music video of her 2019 release Waiting For Me that celebrates the people who are a part of the LGBTQIA+ community.
Madame Gandhi, aka Kiran Gandhi, has never kept away from voicing her strong opinions about gender notions, identity and politics. She, in fact, ran the 2015 London Marathon to combat the period stigma. Other than being the rebel that she is, the artiste has toured as a drummer for M.I.A. and Thievery Corporation and has also performed at the 2020 Vision Stadium Tour hosted by Oprah.
Her own music includes the release of two short-form albums (Voices, 2016 and Visions, 2019), besides a series of music videos produced and conceptualised by women and gender non-conforming creatives. An email chat with the artiste who is now signed with Sony Music Masterworks. Why did you plan to release the video for Waiting For Me on the last day of Pride Month?
We chose to release this video during Pride Month to celebrate the queer, gender non-conforming, and trans people in the music video for Waiting For Me. It is important to me to show the vast diversity within our South Asian community itself. This diversity comes in the form of age, ethnicity, geographic location, sexual orientation, gender identity and more. It is also very important to me to show a genuine portrayal of me and my friendships with other LGBTQIA+ people to debunk stereotypes of what it means to have a queer identity.
Tell us about the idea behind the video….
I grew up going to schools between New York City and Mumbai... I attended all-girls schools… a uniform was required. While I loved my education at St. Anne’s School in Colaba, Mumbai, I did feel that it is problematic that we teach conformity at a young age instead of creativity and self-expression. These behaviours as a society are so ingrained in us that we rarely stop to question them. That is why I wanted to use the imagery in my music video to spark the question among my audience: “What does it mean to challenge society’s most problematic norms?”
You have said: “This music video is a call to action for each of us to examine how hierarchy, capitalism and systemic oppression serve to keep us obedient, with little space for dialogue or critical thinking.” Was this a thought that always remained at the back of your head or did something trigger you to write a song about it?
This is something that I have always felt. The coolest part about making a music video is that it quite literally creates a safe space for each of us to comment and dialogue with each other via YouTube and social media. I am so excited to see the conversations the video has already sparked. In your song you mentioned twice that you’ve been “living in the wild now”. What do you mean by “the wild”?
To me, the wild is about choosing freedom in all aspects of our life. It’s about educating ourselves with the experiences of other people, not just one news source. It is about realising that we get to define what freedom looks and feels like for ourselves. I hope that my audience watches this video and starts to define liberation for themselves, whatever it looks like.
This video was shot during your India tour in February. How did your team and director Misha Ghose scout for the locations?
We wanted to juxtapose an industrial, man-made wasteland against that backdrop of mother nature. To me, this actually represents the masculine versus the feminine. We are so obsessed with building tall phallic structures that we all idolise instead of recognising how divine mother nature really is. So we chose our sites to enable this conversation.
Yellow is a colour that remains constant though. Not only in this video but in a lot of your work. Where does this love for yellow come from?
My name, Kiran, means “ray of light”, and since childhood I have always gravitated towards sunrise and sunset colours. I love how positive they are, joyful, hopeful and fresh. I feel energised by yellow and sunrise colours. 
How did you create your team of designers and local artistes that are all female or gender non-conforming?
I worked with Chalk & Cheese films to intentionally cast folks who are typically under-represented in mainstream media, but who are also folks I would want to be real friends with. This is what has created such a genuine bond both on and off camera and represents the world I want to live in.
Tell us about the relevance of the song and video with the current situation the world is in.
I have a lyric — “Mothers, sisters, non-conformists, all the things that they’ve done for us, the earth is still waiting for us…” — to design a trans-inclusive narrative around the lineage of women. I think during Pride Month, and against the backdrop of global protest and pandemic around the world, I wanted to release a video that spoke to how we are all feeling. We all want to feel vibrant and colourful and free. We want to abolish colourism around the world. We want to celebrate people of different gender identities. We want to drum loudly and lovingly and protest systems of oppression that we do not agree with. The video showcases that both visually and lyrically.
You have always been vocal about elevating the female voice and redefining notions of gender. Any advice for them?
Yes, we have to surround ourselves purely with people who love and see us for who we are. If we don’t, then we start to question ourselves and allow the self-doubt to come in. I am very intentional about whom I interact with, because it allows me to shine as bright as I can, and do so in turn for others.
We hear your third short-form album, Vibrations, is expected next year. Anything you can tell us about it?
Yes! It is a far more vulnerable album and one that was clearly made during a time of introspection during quarantine!",culture
A music video to instill positivity in these trying times," Culture enthusiast Sundeep Bhutoria’s recital with daughter Aavya christened Once Upon a Time in 2020 has been much appreciated on social media as it touches upon the existentialist crisis looming upon humanity owing to the Covid-19 crisis. The 4.53-minute video in Hindi (https://youtu.be/l-9jwnruYOE), set in the year 2025, features some sweet moments between the father and daughter as Aavya persuades Sundeep to tell her about the year 2020. Conceptualised and curated by Sundeep, the video, starting with a still of the Churu Junction in Rajasthan (Sundeep was born in Churu) features a montage of shots from everyday life.
The high point of the video is the music that has been composed by Padma Bhushan recipient Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, a Hindustani classical music instrumentalist and Grammy award winner, and assisted by his son Saurabh Bhatt. Neelam Muntashir, wife of renowned lyricist, poet and screenwriter Manoj Muntashir has penned the narrative and helped with the nazms (nazm is a major part of Urdu poetry that is normally written in rhymed verse and also in modern prose-style poems). The video has been done by Gautam Sharma who also did the Teri Mitti tribute video starring Akshay Kumar. There are English subtitles embedded in the video as well.
In the manner of a bedtime story, Sundeep goes on to tell Avya how nature had been offended by humans and hence sent a virus upon its inhabitants. He tells her about the pre-Covid-19 days when people would run after materialistic things and end up dejected, about houses that would resemble hotels as people would come home only to sleep, when the emphasis on bonding and love was non-existent. He also tells her about how technology had replaced nature and humans would spend more time on virtual relationships than real ones. The concept of childhood of earlier generations had ceased to exist and kids were no longer interested in tales of the jungles and animals. The dad explains that the virus was only a wake-up call and people started to believe in family and home once again. Life began to smile again and daily activities made a comeback. He adds that the virus put up a mirror to human society and taught them the value of life, of love, of relationships and of moments.
According to Sundeep, he was inspired by The Great Realization, a video by Kiwi-born Welsh YouTuber and poet Tomos Roberts, popularly known as Probably Tomfoolery. The video was posted on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook three weeks back has attracted over 10 million views. The video has also been shared by many politicians and artistes.
Sundeep said: “I spoke to Manoj Muntashir and then his wife wrote the nazms. I got in touch with Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and asked him to compose the music. I asked Gautam Sharma for his help in creating the visuals. When the end product came, I just casually sent it to friends and thereafter it was picked up by social media followers. I also got a request from a very senior politician in the UK to add English subtitles to it.”
Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt said: “The poem/story is very beautifully written and it’s authentic as it will be very useful for generations to come. It describes what happened in 2020, the disease Covid-19, which shook the whole world. This poem means a lot to us as it is futuristic. Composing the background music with my son Saurabh Bhatt where Sundeep narrated a bedtime story to his daughter Aavya was very interesting for us.”

“When Sundeep approached me for this, I was more than happy to write the nazm with the hope to inspire and instil positivity in an unprecedented time — that this pandemic too shall pass,” said Neelam Muntashir.",culture
All ways in Wayanad," This is what he said: “No one here does only one job. That’s why you do not see any slums or poverty. We’re a hard-working people.” That was Suresh Bhaskar, a tourist guide in Wayanad in northeast Kerala. This was some time before the coronavirus crash-landed in the state. What followed thereafter showed the rest of the country the Kerala template, but that’s a story all too well known now. 
Suresh’s story came to be told as he chaperoned his little tour group through hilly terrains and mud tracks cutting across farmlands. Those exact words were uttered as the 44-year-old ushered everyone into a villager’s house in Kavumannam for a taste of their traditional vegetarian lunch. He helped the host, Kuttayi, serve, and also continued with his commentary on each dish. Suresh said of Kuttayi, a man in his thirties dressed in a blue checked shirt and a kaavi mundu (the local name for a dull saffron lungi), “He is a chef. He hosts tourists too and opens his house as a homestay accommodation.”
The opening words were part of his introduction of Kuttayi, but they could just as well be applied to him — not one to do just one thing.

A farmer’s son, Suresh had set off to attend a poetry camp in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram) as a teenager. He was one of the 50 selected from across the state. “I had seen the notification in a magazine at the Bodhi Granthalaya in our village. I did not have the means, so the library helped me apply and also sponsored my travel,” recalled Suresh. “The library is long gone,” he added in soft tones. That was the first time he was travelling out of Wayanad and his first unescorted travel. It was his first train journey as well.
In Trivandrum, Suresh was lodged near an art gallery — the Sri Chitra Art Gallery, famous for its Raja Ravi Varma collection. A walk through the gallery opened another world for him. “Back in school I used to draw and had won many competitions too. But I had no idea of the different forms, mediums, schools of art,” he laughed. In any case, the boy who entered the gallery was not the same person who left it that day.
Suresh started dreaming of it as a vocation. The newly learnt names — Raja Ravi Varma, Nicholas Roerich, the Mughal school, the Tanjore school, Chinese, Japanese and Balinese paintings, mural and miniatures — and their images swirled inside his head.
He completed a diploma course in art after he had done his bachelor’s in Malayalam. His parents were not happy with this “distraction”, so he would paint only when he wasn’t helping them on the farm. He would also paint political banners and posters to ease the financial burden. After a couple of years, there came a time when he held his solo exhibition. His work found its way into the portals of the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi too.
By 2007-08, tourism picked up in Wayanad in a big way. Said Suresh, “I thought I might as well make the most of it.”
When one of the members of our tour group, a man from Hyderabad, struggled to explain to his folks back home over the phone where exactly he was, Suresh prompted him in Telugu. It is not surprising to have a tourist guide know a language or two other than his mother tongue. But turned out Suresh also knew Tamil and Kannada, Hindi and English. He said, “I did not pick up the languages as a tour guide. I had started learning them when I began travelling to do freelance commercial artwork and exhibitions.” After a pause he added, “I learnt French at the Alliance Française in Puducherry. When we started getting a lot of foreign tourists, I realised it would help.”
As he traipsed all over Wayanad district shepherding tourists, Suresh did not lose sight of art. In fact, he travelled beyond the canvas. He got into clay-modelling and with such seriousness too that he eventually started to get calls for workshops. And then, in 2018, along with two others, he founded an art gallery.
And so he meanders on, continues to discover new boundaries, true to his own definition of the Kerala template: everyone does everything.",culture
Veteran voice of fashion," She launched Calcutta’s first ever ‘designer wear’ outlet in a tiny room on Wellesley Street. More than 50 years have passed since then. Ritu Kumar still remains relevant, is more than ever busy and every bit the fashion doyen. So, when she tells you that she can’t believe that she is sitting and looking at trees and “loving it”, in what would otherwise have been frenetic months, you feel the real reverberations of the pandemic. The Telegraph caught up with her on a June afternoon over phone. Extracts...

You are someone who is constantly travelling and working. How has life been in the past three months?

Actually, I didn’t quite realise how to take this... how the telephonic conversations, the Zoom calls would be. They have been very effective. For two months, we have been totally locked out of the office and are at home. So, I have been using the time to write my book and articles. One has had time to really rethink about what we are doing to our lives and to the world and how much of this is going to affect us and how much of this is so necessary for us. I don’t see that much. Particularly in the fashion world, you have to rethink your priorities. Where were you just before the lockdown?

Just before the lockdown, I was in Paris. Then I was in Bombay for a show where I walked the ramp for sustainable fashion, came back here (Delhi) and was in the studio literally that morning and then I came home and they said it’s lockdown. No time to even hand over or anything because we were just given four hours to lock down. Having said that, I think the pace of life has changed. I have started doing a lot of my yoga, exercises and writing a book that has been on the back-burner for too long.
Since it’s opened, I am told not to go out yet because Delhi is peaking in a bad way. I am working from the house. The photographs come here. I send it on WhatsApp. So far so good, but I don’t know how long is it going to take for people to start acting normal because nobody really wants to risk going out.

What are these months like for you normally?

You know, summers are so busy because the designers are here from Europe because we do an export line as well. They are here in May because the collection has to be shown in September and it is hectic. I am doing the winter line for the bridals as well as the normal line... it’s madness. I actually cannot believe that I am sitting and looking at the trees and in some ways I am really loving it.

What kind of a collection were you planning and will that change now?
Frankly, we are just about opening. Our last collection was halfway through but fortunately in India, we don’t have winter, summer. Just the colours change. We had already been planning for the winter. We are hoping that people come back and we can complete that collection. I think most companies would have had a complete season’s loss. This is a very in-between time right now. What is on your mind right now?

We are going classic. We are not doing anything which is too fast fashion. We are not doing anything which will have to be chucked out of the wardrobe if the season changes because I think I would like to retain an amount of handwork as much as we can to ensure that at least the wheels keep going round.

Do you think luxurywear would change?

I think it is the other way round. I think occasions to wear luxury will be very few for the foreseeable future. Events which are going to have lots of people and lots of interaction, till we see the end of this pandemic, are going to be really conservative. Even at the moment you are allowed only 50 people at the wedding which you can have inside your house. No venues are being booked. People are wanting to come to us and see what they can pick up and none of these are very long-term orders. That seems to be the trend. And the best is that people are preferring the Internet. The fear of being unsafe is not there. And it is not only in India that we are getting a lot of requests. There is international interest too because people are not coming to India this year.

The brand has been a lot about touch and feel…  do you miss that?

If they have a choice they would definitely like to touch and feel. No question about it. Even I would, but it’s just that people are now in a situation where they have a wedding next month and the whole family can’t come shopping… it’s not totally out of choice, but necessity. We hope it goes away soon because this is a very awkward and uncomfortable time in the whole world. And, this is the first time this has happened. We have been in this business for 50 years. When the export was good, the retail market sat down a little. When the retail market picked up, the export market was a little down. This time, internationally, the same thing has happened to everyone. We don’t see a ray of hope in either people travelling a lot, big weddings or having large orders from the people whom we work with. Even places like Dubai and everywhere have also gone down flat.

What were your initial concerns as a designer and someone who has a business to run?

Like everybody else, we wanted to keep it going. We wanted to be able to pay salaries and didn’t want to let peoples leave their jobs as much as you could, to keep the place together and running... but the longer it goes, the more difficult it becomes. I am hoping slowly (things get back to normal), but it’s totally dependent on the pandemic. When people start feeling more confident, like they are in Kerala or Punjab where there is no such scare, people are beginning to come.

Have you scaled down production?

We just opened a week back and there was hardly any labour there and we had to complete what we were doing. Then we are going to be thinking about newer work.

Have you reached out to your weavers?

Yes, of course, almost always on a daily basis because most of our people work out of their homes in Bengal. So, we try to deal with it as often and as much as we can, till such time our stores open. So far I think it’s not so bad.

They are in touch over the phone with the head office in Calcutta, almost every day. We are keeping something going all the time. They are getting their pay, which is very good. That’s all that they want. They have produced thousands of masks for the slum areas around our factory in Delhi. We manufactured in the time that we were locked down. We got the permission to open with eight workers and they began making 500 masks every day.
I have worked with them for 30 years. They are not telling me so much about us because they know it’s going where. It’s just that the market is in a bit of an emergency and they are worried that they would get stuck with the stuff and the payments won’t come.

For someone who has been in the industry for more than 50 years, what is that you want from the government?

It’s not about what I want, but what I think they should be doing… not get the emporia and the government to sell pieces, retail handloom. They have to look at it like a start-up. It has an enormous potential, but handloom and handicrafts do not have the potential to be able to pay very high overheads of malls. They could set up a start-up which could devise a way of getting the production from the weaver or the embroidery person, facilitate it through web-selling and get it to customers and take some sort of a percentage on it. The middleman in this situation, I think, is not going to get extinct. It isn’t that it hasn’t before. It has happened in the ’50s when the government came in, in a big way and they made sure these lasted. It can surely happen again. And, I think this is a time we cannot really leave it because then we will lose our handicrafts altogether. This is not cheap labour. This is qualified labour. And, it is an unnecessary waste of DNA. Being almost like a parent figure in the fraternity, what is your suggestion for all the designers?

If you really ask me and it might come across as a bit of a shock, the Indian fashion industry just works as a catalyst. The Indian fashion industry is far too small to do anything but become a driving force of an aspirational garment. And, when people look at that, they want to copy it. They are not going to have it at that price… they will get it for a couple of thousand rupees in Metiabruz or in the haat, but the aspirational quality is what Indian fashion drives. We can continue with that effort. There will always be people who would want the top end of the line.

Are you okay with a digital fashion week?

There is nothing like an actual live performance, but if that’s the need of the hour and people want to show their stuff, that would probably be a marginal solution.

Life as you see today through the fashion lens…  what is it looking like at the moment?

Simpler. Perhaps we are all learning to live with the wardrobes we have. In India, we’ve never really had the money to afford wastage of fashion. In India, it’s always been buy something for the wedding which you can give to your daughter when she gets married. I think we will slowly get back to a more classic way of thinking, which would be very sound for us because we don’t like waste. Now more than ever that the reality has come down… because we are going to go through some sort of a recession. Health is going to be more important than clothes.

What book are you are working on?

Well, I am putting down all my travels in the world of textiles in India. If you want to go to the villages next to Calcutta, you’ll know where to go and where to start working from. You’ll know where each weaver is. There are piles of notes from over 50 years, since the time of my first revival… Ranihati and Serampore near Calcutta. They are in bullet points! I remember the most important points. I think it will take a year. The bright side of (this lockdown) is that I have done a lot of work on it.

What is your takeaway from this experience?

The children came… they were saying even they have nothing to do… so, lot of bonding… eating together… a lot of cooking…. Family time, reading time, writing time! ",culture
Good Earth Embraces ‘Still’ness with their Summer ’20 Collection," For a generation spurred on by the aspiration of perhaps beating the speed of light in their quest to conquer the world, one 5G-click at a time, being “still” is a luxury that many can’t warrant. Home-bred luxury fashion brand Good Earth, with their latest summer collection titled Still, is here to remind us about the beauty and luxury that “stillness” exudes, with their range of apparel and homeware. Pivoted around the present stillness of being, which has left us appreciating the little things of profundity that were otherwise relegated to the status of mundane, Good Earth’s Still also examines its various connotations in motion, mind and life through a series of three artistic collaborations. While the first one with dancer Shivani Varma explored stillness in motion through the languorous thaath anga of Kathak, the second collaboration saw artist Joya Mukherjee Logue delving into the stillness of mind and its serenity as she put her paintbrush to paper. The final instalment of this collaboration saw poet and co-founder/creative director of Huemn, Pranav Misra, reflect on the stillness of life through his poetry. In a chat with The Telegraph, Anita Lal, founder and creative director, Good Earth, gives us a peek into their latest collection.

How was your latest summer collection of apparel and homeware conceptualised?

Our Summer ’20 collection, Still, is inspired by the moments of stillness and their subtle charm, the quietude and unhurried languor of the season.
The Sustain apparel collection, Chaya is a line-up of classic Sustain silhouettes and loungewear for a relaxed time, largely spent indoors. Easy kurtas, chogas and kaftans in soothing whites are crafted in diaphanous Chanderis and the softest handloom cotton, uplifted with hints of tonal embroidery.
Chand Bagh, the Home collection, is a range of home linen in soft ivory. Crafted from fine linen and cotton, this all-white bed collection, is highlighted with tonal embroidery in a floral jaal pattern, to create the perfect vision of summer along with textured and embroidered cushions in bright prints and neutral tones.

What led to the predominant use of white in it?

Still encapsulates the serene spirit of the season. It was conceptualised keeping in mind the current times, the slower pace of life and the need to stay indoors. Our designers delved into a slower rhythm to create a sublime range of apparel and home linen that captures the stillness of summer. The focus of the collection is on an all-white palette to usher in an essence of calm, which is further accentuated by the choice of fabrics, relaxed cuts, tonal embroidery and delicate handcrafted details.

Good Earth is known for its practical silhouettes and wearability, along with keeping it stylish. Take us through the design elements of the apparel in this collection and how it figures within the aesthetics of the brand.

The design philosophy behind Sustain is to use natural fabrics and create elegant daily-wear in timeless styles rooted in the textile traditions of India. Similarly, Still features an array of traditional ensembles which are contemporised by our designers such as cropped farshi pants, and kaftans with modern interpretations of kimono sleeves, uplifted with hints of embroidery, modern pleating, scalloped sleeves, and crochet and lace-detailing, for everyday comfort and simplicity.

You have also collaborated with artistes for this. What led to this amalgamation of the arts for this collection?

With the shift in the scenario and our audience mostly interacting with us through digital mediums, we had curated three exclusive Instagram experiences with artistes in diverse fields exploring “stillness”, through their craft to understand connotations, interpretations and significance of the concept. Through a video series, we delve into the ideas of stillness in motion, stillness in mind and stillness in life through a mesmerising Kathak rendition with Shivani Varma, a still-life painting session with Joya Mukherjee Logue, and a profound poetic recountal with Pranav Misra.

The consumption of fashion is staring at crossroads now with many willing to change their buying habits. What do you foresee in the industry and how does Good Earth plan to tackle that?

With changing times, we do foresee a shift in buying habits and the redefining of fashion as a concept. Focus on new collections will reduce and more versatile clothes will be in demand — something that you can wear from morning to evening with minor tweaks. On the retail front, we are encouraging our customers to shop from the comforts of their home through our web boutique. Our personal shoppers and customer care team are available all day to assist them via WhatsApp and calls, with product selection, placing an order, and facilitate contactless payment and home deliveries.

Still encourages one to look within during this period of flux. Personally, how have you dealt with this time?

At a time like this, we are reminded that it is fine to step back sometimes so that you can see the world more clearly and love it more deeply. I believe one should enjoy the simple pleasures of life.

Andrew Sean Greer on his Pulitzer win and sartorial choices to define ‘joy’," Andrew Sean Greer knew he wanted to be a writer when he was 10 years old, writing a self-illustrated book for a class assignment. In 2018, he came out with his book Less, a comic tale of a 49-year-old gay writer Arthur Less who receives an invite to the wedding ceremony of the love of his life. An unabashedly romantic novel, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2018, a rare feat for a comic novel. But that’s the mark of Greer — the ability to find humour in pathos and the celebration of all things joyous with prose so poignant, you can’t help but compulsively suggest his books to near and dear ones, once you are done with them. Also the author of books like The Confessions of Max Tivoli, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells and The Story of a Marriage and winner of California Book Award, New York Public Library Young Lions Award, NEA grant, and a Guggenheim Fellowship, he was the former executive director of Santa Maddalena Foundation, a writer’s retreat in Tuscany which has invited the likes of Amitav Ghosh, Kiran Desai, Zadie Smith, Sally Rooney and more.

Greer, who is very active on social media, made news for his sartorial choice at the Pulitzer Prize award, a bright pink second-hand suit he bought online upon hearing of his win! The quirky author with an impeccable sense of humour hosts AMAs (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit and interacts with fans on Instagram. He was a part of Oxford Bookstore’s Rainbow Festival, where he went live on Facebook in his “Indian outfit in bright pink because it’s Pride”! He spoke about being an ally to the Queer community and his own coming out story.
The Telegraph caught up with the author after his session to dig deeper into what goes on in his bright, colourful, vibrant, humorous mind. Other than intense online shopping upon hearing about your Pulitzer win(!), how has the award changed or affected your life? How important are awards to your writing process?

The Pulitzer has changed everything about my life — at least in the short term because it holds such esteem that I was suddenly being asked to events that I had never even heard of before! Before the prize, for instance, I had never been invited to an international literary festival. The year after the prize, I had to turn down quite a few in order to keep my writing schedule! I was also asked to speak in the USA, something that had never happened before. And of course, it brought attention to my other books. And so everything changed.
And also: nothing did. Because here I am, alone in my office, working every day as I have been doing for 20 years. Just going forward on a novel, with all the doubt and heartache and joy that entails. Prizes have nothing to do with the writing process. But they do affect the writer — because almost every writer struggles with income, with self-confidence, with a sense of invisibility. And it can be wonderful for that. But, again, it doesn’t change the writing. That goes on with the same willpower as before.

How much of Andrew Sean Greer exists in Arthur Less?

I would say quite a bit, but I would also say that of all my characters!  They are all me, in some way. One of the “villains” in Less, for instance, Finley Dwyer, is also me. The things he says are just thoughts I have in my own head. He is based on nobody but me. And my friends find Arthur Less amusing because, while they recognise a number of incidents, they are all told “incorrectly” in the sense that they did not happen that way, to that person, in that place, and so on. I don’t see Arthur as me (though I admit the resemblance). I have to admit I like him quite a bit more than myself. You chose to write a comic novel about a gay author with a happy ending — both radical choices hardly experienced before in fiction. Were there any trepidations on your mind?

Ha ha! No, none! Because I assumed nobody would ever read it. So I wrote purely for my own joy. And, amazingly, that is exactly what people love about the book. Unfortunately, it’s a hard mode to recreate — now, for instance, I KNOW people will read my next book. I can’t pretend it’s just for me.

Your sartorial choices have been the talk of the town! Do you feel the need to share the same interest with your characters?

Well that is as charming a question as they come. Arthur hardly dresses as ridiculously as I do, but I did give him some foolishness in his blue suit. And I hope the appearance of another suit near the end is pleasing — I find clothes so pleasing. Because I like the sense that I can change. I often dress the opposite of the mood I’m in — I’ll dress in black if I’m happy and bright colours if I’m blue. Because the black won’t depress me if I’m in a good mood but the bright colours will always lift my spirits. And of course, I dress up to write! Just like Thomas Mann. Even in quarantine!

What is your writing process like, from inception to execution?

Usually, I have one image I can’t get out of my mind. And I write things around it until I start inventing characters and situations and then I sit down and say to myself: okay, what do I have here? And I outline it all. And I try to follow it, and I fail. And I have to sit down again and reconsider the book. In the book I’m working on now, the image I am working on is a silhouette in a tower in Puerto Rico, something I saw when I visited two years ago. I am writing towards that image. And I just changed a crucial part of the beginning so it can meet where I am now (nowhere near the tower, just so you know!)  As I get older, I trust my instincts more than my intellect. Which is terrifying.

What is your research process like for books that are set in the past?

I find newspapers to be a wonderful source of information, as long as you bear in mind that they are a fantasy of their present moment, not reality. They are full of false fears and false comforts. So don’t read the headlines — read the advertisements. And the cooking manuals. I find the things that slipped through history, that aren’t talked about, the pieces of clothing and little stories that are past even human memory. Bringing those back feels like patching up something torn. And includes the people whose stories are left out of history.

You are an author with a great online presence. How does negative feedback affect you, if at all?

Oh, I’m terribly sensitive! Just yesterday someone wrote to me and said they thought I didn’t deserve the Pulitzer. I was shocked! Who would say something like that to someone? And I wrote back, well that’s incredibly rude but you must be going through a really hard time, I wish you the best. I mean: one thing we are sure of, anyone we come across these days is going through a hard time. Time to be a little sympathetic. But I tell you, I’m not going back on Twitter anytime soon!

If not a writer, you would have been...?

A personal chef?

What can we expect next from your table?

Well, you can have pasta with fava beans tonight! But if you mean my writing table, it is another comic novel about America. A hard topic for comedy these days. But comedy comes from sadness, doesn’t it? So there be something to write about.",culture
Sabyasachi Mukherjee on the future of fashion," Sabyasachi Mukherjee is not a man of few words. And, when he speaks, you listen. You are inspired. A shining example of self-made, Sabya, as he has been adorably monikered by his fashion fraternity, owns his name to a T. A lesson in dexterity — a creative genius matched by a keen sense of business — Sabyasachi oozes the dignity of making it to the top, never underplaying his craft. A quintessential ghee-bhaat loving Bengali, he is also your atypical Bengali. Bold. His world view makes him a philosopher and his quick wit, a teenager at soul.
“Right now, I’ll tell you my hands are very sweaty because I have done many webinars but I have suddenly realised that this was like a party that I have tried to avoid for 20 years… I get to see everybody here. I have never been this social in my life. So, hello everyone in Calcutta,” were his opening lines at an 85 Lansdowne live exclusive, The Future of Luxury Business, on a Zoom call one June afternoon, where he was in conversation with Priya Tanna of Vogue. Excerpts….

I have always thought that luxury for all of us has always been time...

My idea of luxury hasn’t changed during the pandemic. I have always thought that luxury for all of us has always been time. In a world which is completely guided by capitalism and when we are all chasing money… sometimes we don’t really know what to do with that money because there are two ways of looking at luxury — material luxury, which is the clothes that you wear, the make-up that you put on and the handbags that you use; but the main luxury is the dialogue and the conversation that you have with yourself. Fifteen years ago when I was in Goa, a friend asked me if I wanted to do a course in vipassana. I didn’t know what vipassana was. So, they explained to me that vipassana was all about remaining silent so that you disconnect the external world and have conversations with yourself. And, I do this every single day of my life because when I come back home, I don’t watch television, I don’t listen to music, I don’t talk to people… I just sit quietly and talk to myself… or I just stay with myself for 45 minutes because that’s my way of rebooting. For me, if I wasn’t given that time, I think a bigger part of my life’s luxury would have been taken out and I would end up becoming cranky.

For me, luxury is being able to have the time to be the best version of yourself and everything else would follow. I have always said that fashion and beauty have an important role to play in people’s manifestation of themselves. The first manifestation is about confidence and confidence comes from being who you are. You can only be yourself if you have the luxury of time to spend some time with yourself to understand who you are.

Frida Kahlo always led her life the way she wanted to...

She has always been my muse because of the fact that she was body-confident, culturally confident... she always led her life the way she wanted to lead her life. She was confident about her beauty and celebrated her unibrow and took every adversity and made that into a positive resource. And, when people lead that kind of a life which is so holistic and manage to influence people... these are people who are leading true lives of luxury. I don’t think for me luxury is a price barometer. It’s a lifestyle and cultural capital barometer.

Powered By PLAYSTREAM I will make my craft stronger and stronger...

The only kind of work you can do right now is work that has demand. I am not only talking about fashion, but every industry. The greatest indignity that can happen to any businessman is not to have the means or the financial resources to be able to look after the people who have created a ecosystem for many many years. The best thing to do right now would be to create a little bit of work for weavers for a new season. That season does not have to be an immediate season... because in the immediate season we see no recovery... but to be able to give them some sort of a work from your savings that can be adopted into a new season, which I would probably think is spring/summer ’21. And also this is the time to be able to hold craft at its highest level because a big fallout of any recession, any pandemic... whenever there is big loss of finance in the world, there are two kinds of consumption — some people are going to become very mindful of what they consume and some people are going to become outrageous about what they consume because a lot of people will try to hide the anxiety of losing money and it will be a defence mechanism. We saw that happening with Dior with the new look. In one kind of consumption, the product will become very simple and in the other, the product will sustain at its highest level and I will choose to do this second part of the consumption where I will make my craft stronger and stronger so that I can keep people at their jobs because when your market share decreases, what will automatically happen is that people will not stop shopping, but they will stop shopping for things which is about time-bound products and they are going to be smarter about the consumption. They are going to consume less, but they will consume the best.

This is the best time for craft consolidation. So, instead of making 500 saris because I might not have 500 customers, I will probably create only 20 saris that will take the same time. This is the time to make saris like patan patolas because these cannot be made in larger quantities but can be made for people who will have the money to shop post the pandemic.

Let’s talk about a favourite topic of mine... nepotism. It exists in the jewellery industry...

For the longest time, jewellery has had a very strange relationship with India. I was in Bergdorf Goodman and meeting the head buyers... they came to India and fell in love with my jewellery and wanted to put it in the Bergdorf windows... I have been in the clothing industry for 20 years, my clothes didn’t make the cut because when Linda Fargo (of Bergdorf Goodman) came to India, she came with the idea of taking me to Bergdorf. She didn’t know what she wanted out of me and then she saw the jewellery and she said ‘my customers in America will love your jewellery’. We took the jewellery there and the first question I asked her was how does one do the certification of the jewellery in America. She looked at me and said: ‘What do you mean?’ I said: How much gold, ruby, emerald, diamonds... she said ‘Americans don’t work like that. If you are buying something which is an important stone like an engagement ring, which is 10 carat or eight carat, you might get a certificate from GIA’. She took me to Bergdorf... the floor... where I saw some unusual jewellery being made by some top jewellers using shell, wood and diamonds... she said ‘How do you value this jewellery’. No one buys jewellery as an investment. They buy jewellery as art.
In India for longest time people have looked at jewellery from the point of view of investment and not consumption. And, what has happened because of that is craft has suffered. You ask any woman in this country to buy jewellery, either by her in-laws or her husband or a member in the family, she is asked to parrot a few questions... some of them she doesn’t even understand... the most important question... what is the buy-back?

Jewellery for the longest time in India... for the last 20 years has been used for trading. If I buy jewellery for Rs 100, is there a way when I sell my jewellery, I can get
Rs 95 back? Which means five per cent is my wastage. What happens is that people are trying to make the craftsmanship weaker and weaker because nobody wants to pay for craftsmanship... which they call ‘making’. But, you have to understand that the cultural capital of India is far bigger than the intrinsic capital of India. We all know the value of diamonds and emeralds, rubies that are artificially generated. They are found in abundance in the mines. We ration them to increase their prices, but what is truly rare is craftsmanship. I have been working with a lot of Bengali babus... the karigars... the best in the entire jewellery ecosystem all over the country... the level of craftsmanship that I saw in jewellery made in the 1940s and 1950s... and the jewellery I see here right now, it is really shocking how bad craftsmanship has become. If crafts skip a generation, it might never come back to this country again.
So, we have started doing a lot of craft-based jewellery... much like the details we do in our clothes. At a time, when the intrinsic value of jewellery will get devalued, the only thing which will make it to museums would be craftsmanship. I am very proud to say that we have been in the jewellery business for three years and we have dressed up 350 brides all over the country in jewellery in the last two-and-half years. I have done it silently.

Let’s talk about a favourite topic of mine... nepotism. It exists in the jewellery industry because it is the most difficult industry to crack in. They say if you don’t come from a jewellery background and you don’t have a pedigree, you cannot break in. I thought Tanishq did a great job by showing India that they are not a first-generation jeweller but they have corporatised the jewellery industry and made it more transparent. I think the legs on which the Indian jewellery industry is going to go forward will be integrity, quality, craftsmanship and transparency. You come to our stores, every single price point is marked. I think the jewellery industry in this country needs to understand that you need to corporatise jewellery. For a long time, jewellery has been a shady business. Now it needs to celebrate authenticity.
  It took me 20 years to get to Bergdorf Goodman but I got there...

Many many years ago when I was showing at New York Fashion Week, I went to Bergdorf Goodman to show my clothes. Roopal Patel who is the current fashion director for Saks (Fifth Avenue) was the head of buying at Bergdorf Goodman at that point and I got rejected... I remember standing on Fifth Avenue and looking at the windows of Bergdorf and saying one day I will be there. It took me 20 years to get there but I got there. We got four windows which is unheard of in Bergdorf Goodman, to show our jewellery. Right next to Chanel, if I may say so! Every designer in the world wants to be at Bergdorf, whether it is (Christian) Louboutin or Chanel or Dolce & Gabbana... it is famously said that if you are not at Bergdorf Goodman, you are nowhere. There is also a movie called Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf’s.

The jewellery sold very well. I don’t think Bergdorf has seen such a big onslaught of Gujaratis. The person who was at the restaurant downstairs said they should start serving dhoklas. When I came back, the pandemic had shut down the exhibition, but there was a lady who was adamant that she wanted to buy Sabyasachi jewellery for an engagement. They were in Mexico and they were stranded and they came back and the first thing they did when they landed was tell Bergdorf that please open the store. Bergdorf was, of course, not allowed to open the store. So they did something which they had never done before. They called the woman to 57th Street, set up a Sabyasachi shop on the sidewalk with bodyguards and personal shoppers, with the jewellery team... a small table and a mirror. The woman came with her husband in a cab and she bought fine jewellery at Bergdorf outside, on the streets of New York. This was the first day of sales and it was the first product that sold off at Bergdorf Goodman. I was in my shorts and T-shirt with multiple holes on the shoulder... at midnight preparing to go to sleep, teleconferencing and video chatting with the buyers at Bergdorf, the president and the customer... it was a surreal experience.

Brands where the intangibles are far greater than the tangibles, these are the brands which are going to survive the pandemic...

I always tell people that if you need to do price-cutting, it means that there is something inherently wrong with your business because it is not sustainable. 

I am not being arrogant but I am very proud to say that my brand will not go on discount post the pandemic because the kind of value we offer to our customer and when you offer a product to a customer, the price doesn’t describe the value. The value is described by a host of tangibles and intangibles. It’s about the way your stores are set... many many customers of mine worldwide have said one common thing: when we buy a Sabyasachi, it’s an investment and owning one makes them feel proud. With Chanel, they say, it is almost like a drug. You buy a Chanel irrespective of the product because of the value system that a Chanel represents to you, or an Hermes. It is a little immodest for me to say this but unfortunately I am the spokesperson of my company and it happens to have my name on it... but we have created that value system for our customers. I was trying to get back a lot of clothes from my customers to build my archives because I wasn’t very organised when I started my business. I spoke to a lot of my Marwari customers in Calcutta offering them a 400 per cent incentive to give my clothes back and not a single one of them agreed. Brands where the intangibles are far greater than the tangibles, these are the brands which are going to survive the pandemic.

For us right now, it is no longer about profit maximisation. It is about survival...

The most important problem of being small is to sustain livelihoods. We are all struggling to keep our backend. For us right now, it is no longer about profit maximisation. It is about survival. Profits are something that can happen much later. A lot of us have built up businesses with integrity. It is who we are and who we become. I think the biggest concern for us is to be able to somehow maintain that continuity.

We are using our Instagram as a channel to educate and inspire our consumers about luxury goods of India. A lot of you here are women of privilege and if for one year you decide to invest in consumption within the country, you can collectively make so much difference to tourism, jewellery, hospitality, food, entertainment, music. Get the shehnaiwallahs back and your local halwais. Don’t get flowers from outside the country. Don’t get decor which needs to be flown in. You need to keep the cultural capital of this country alive.

Thankfully for us, we are still in the highest essential as we are in the wedding business...

I have never believed in knee-jerk reactions to my business but it needs to be agile for it to tide over a crisis. Unfortunately or fortunately, right now fashion has been reduced to a complete non-essential. Thankfully for us, we are still in the highest essential as we are in the wedding business. Weddings are still going to happen. I have started using Instagram almost like a demi e-commerce website because 40 per cent of my business comes from America. Many of them cannot make it to India and I don’t have a store in America. Weddings are once-in-a-lifetime affair. Most of the girls, if they have their options, are going to touch and feel. Though if stores are shut, we are still offering the same privilege. So, people are shopping more and more because they have the confidence that his boutique is not going to be contaminated. Jugaad comes in everything we do. Once the pandemic ends, we are all going to be exuberant in our celebrations.

A big fallout of the pandemic is also going to be about luxury consumption that categorises psychologically as investment.

People will need a place to escape...

One of the big outcomes of World War II was a return to musicals because everybody needed escape. Anything which is a visual representation of our culture will become so much more stronger and relevant after the pandemic because people will need a place to escape. Over and above everything, they will need hope.

Reverse migration is going to become the most important for couture...

The most important thing for couture is your backend. Now with the migrant labour population, we are very lucky to be in Calcutta and West Bengal because most of the migrant labour in embroidery, which is the mainstay of couture in India, is from this part of the country or Uttar Pradesh... my worry is a lot of them are so heartbroken and disillusioned with the way we have treated them, with such short-term thinking, that many of them would not want to go back. Reverse migration is going to be become the most important for couture. This is the time for the industries to win back the trust of their labour.

Our biggest problem is when we start thinking in isolation, we start fearing in isolation...

Five or six designers can put a factory together. You can create your own multi-designer store. Our biggest problem is when we start thinking in isolation, we start fearing in isolation. As a community, we fear less.

Do we...?

I think a lot of people will start becoming introspective. Do we really need another lipstick shade. Do we really need another pair of high heels? Do we really need another dress or handbag? We are going to redefine and reprioritise our needs and then buy what is really necessary for us. Fashion fulfils the role of functionality and also helps you create a dream for yourself and helps you express through that dream. It is going to be about what you can buy with the budget that you have and whether you need to spend that budget at all.

It is almost a dichotomy...

Look at what we have done to the world because of our greed and look at the population problem of the world. Today we are in such a situation that we have to slow down, but if we have to slow down, a lot of jobs will be lost. Are our governments, collectively and as individuals, understanding the problem of sustaining economies yet at the same time reducing carbon footprint? It is almost a dichotomy. The answer definitely is conserving the planet at the expense of losing lives and livelihoods. The planet is a greater whole. Sustainability is not a luxury any more. It is something that has to happen.
  Missing the most: My workshop. I want to go back to work.

An Instagram account I have started following this lockdown: @upworthy

A movie I watched on loop: Ritwik Ghatak’s Meghe Dhaka Tara. Every time I have a crisis and I want to make myself strong, I watch Meghe Dhaka Tara.

A song playing in my head: A version actually. Harry Belafonte... What A Wonderful World.

If a movie were made on my life, who would I want to play me: Oh my god! Who looks like me?! Baba Ramdev?!
(Someone recommended Rajkummar Rao. ‘I thought somebody would say Deepika Padukone in drag, but Rajkummar is great!’ laughed Sabya. The Telegrah recommended Aamir Khan. ‘That’ll be great!’ said Sabya.)

The first Sabyasachi bride: I don’t know who she was, but she was related to one of the ladies who run a boutique in Calcutta called Kali. I sold the lehnga for Rs 30,000, a multi-panel lehnga in the colours of sunset. I couldn’t afford a model. My sister (Payal) was the model for my campaign.

My international counterpart: Dries Van Noten. If I wanted my brand to be like somebody’s, I would say Chanel.

Would love to dress: Madonna in a rani pink Benarasi sari. I have always wanted Madonna to recreate that India phase... when she used to wear henna and maangtika. I want to dress up Madonna as an Indian bride.

A fashion trend I hope that never comes back: A corset. There is a men’s version on Spanx. I for a second realised what it felt to be a woman. I was in Selfridges and I made the rare mistake of trying on a pair. Vanity overtook me. I couldn’t breathe. I came out of the changing room in my underwear and Spanx and told the saleswoman to cut it off with a pair of scissors!

The first piece of designer wear I bought with my own money: I don’t know if it was designer enough, but for me it was very aspirational. I bought a pair of Levi’s 501. I am obsessed with them and I felt that I have upgraded myself... I felt like I had a penthouse in Bandra.

The most worn piece of clothing: A Uniqlo T-shirt with holes. The clothes you sleep in are a relationship you have. It’s the real skeletons in our closet that we really adore.
If I could have one meal all my life, it would be:Kaffir lime, gobindobhog rice, masoor dal, aloo bhaji, a little bit of ghee and mirchi. ",culture
Anupam Kher takes his autobiographical play to the web," Anupam Kher’s life story that he used to act out himself in the play Kuch Bhi Ho Sakta Hai is now available on his new digital portal theanupamkher.com for all to watch and get inspired and entertained by. The solo performance which had him narrating his rise from a small-town boy through every professional, emotional and medical hurdle in his life’s journey, focuses on his failures. “I have done more than 15-20 shows of the play in Calcutta,” smiles Kher, as he begins to chat with The Telegraph about his plans for his website, his stint on American television and life in lockdown. Was the stage performance of Kuch Bhi Ho Sakta Hai, which you have uploaded, put up specially for recording on camera?  

No. This was a normal public performance with an audience that had paid for its tickets. Not a line was changed in the script, all 127 pages of it. I was not aware of the camera. I was performing for the audience which had come that day. It was a sold-out show. We shot it as we wanted to have a record of the play. We hired technicians as we wanted good quality recording.

So at that point did you have any plan other than to archive the play?

No. My leg had got hurt and I could not stage the play for one year. When my leg improved, I said let’s shoot it so we can show it to people 10-15 years later also. When I saw the play when lockdown started, I realised that it was not only a very entertaining play but a play that celebrates failure and talks of hope and about not giving up. We are all feeling insecure during lockdown. I thought the play would be a good way to motivate people other than entertaining them. The response has been fantastic so far. Was it your idea to put your life out there on stage?

Yes. A well-known publishing house had asked me to pen my autobiography. I said I don’t have time. They asked me to record it on a tape recorder and they would do the transcription. Over 20-25 days, I recorded whatever came to my mind. One Sunday, I heard the whole eight-nine hours of it. It was hilarious, dramatic and inspiring. I thought: ‘I am an actor, I should not write it. I should act it’. So I hired a writer called Ashok Patole and got in touch with my friend Feroz Abbas Khan to direct it. That’s how the play came up.

That’s a novel way for a play to be born but then, kuch bhi ho sakta hai!

Exactly. That’s what I wanted to call the play. A small-town boy whose father was a clerk in the forest department who came to the city of Bombay with Rs 47 in his pocket. Today after 36 years in cinema, having done 516 films and won a lot of awards, he can say kuch bhi ho sakta hai. Yet the play is not about successes but about my failures, as they have taught me much more. The play originally ends when Om Jai Jagadish (a movie directed by Kher) flopped. After that all my achievements in the last 15 years come in rolling titles.

What is the thought behind putting up the play on your portal? Is this the first of other things to come?

I think this is the first time that someone has put up his life story as a play on his own portal. I was in America. A friend there said: ‘You have done so much in life but why is it scattered all over the place? Why don’t you have your website?’ I met an Indian who owns an IT company in America. He showed me some samples. I checked out many websites as I wanted a good-looking site. Then it struck me why not put up my play on my own website instead of giving it to some OTT platform? It will be the same thing — people have to log in and put their card details to pay and watch. So now I have a running website where I can do anything. I can put up the films I have produced — Bariwali, Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara — over a period of time.  

Is the play a ticketed event?

Yes. One has to register for Rs 399 for 48 hours of multiple viewing. I thought it was important to be professional about it. I have to recover the cost of making the website. It is like going to a theatre. You have to pay Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000 to watch a play. It is important to respect one’s craft. And theatre needs to earn money, whether it is on stage or on a platform.

Do you see it germinating into an OTT platform with other people’s works also on it?

The name of the game is kuch bhi ho sakta hai (laughs). I would love to have other people come on it and it will be fantastic if I could create an OTT platform out of a website.

When you look back at the play, is there anything you would have done differently if you were to make it today?

No. On the website, I have added an introduction, where I introduce the play. I also end the play, saying ‘Now you see what happened to my life between 2005 and 2020’. That is the only addition I have done. Otherwise, the play has remained as it is.

With Gulabo Sitabo releasing online, do you think that is the way forward for the near future?  

We have to keep reinventing ourselves. It is important to change. Even six months ago I never thought I would put my play on the website but I did. I hope cinema will be able to survive and revive. But the idea of making a film to recover the money and to recover the money if you release it on an OTT platform, that is your decision. But how many people would want to do that, I wonder.

If it were to happen to a film of yours, how would you feel as an actor?
My film One Day: Justice Delivered released six months back and didn’t do very well but on Netflix, it was No. 1 for 10 days. I was very happy. As an actor, I want my films to be seen.

In January, you announced getting an extension for your American medical drama series New Amsterdam by three seasons.
This is for the first time in the history of American television that they have given an extension of three seasons to any show.  

Had the lockdown not happened, would you have been shooting there now?

A season is of 22 episodes but we had to stop (Season Two) at Episode 19. We were supposed to start shooting for the 20th episode but the pandemic was announced and we stopped shooting on March 12. Luckily, I returned to India on March 20, just before lockdown was announced on March 22. Whenever we get an opportunity, we will go back and shoot.

What project would you resume shooting with?

Before the lockdown was announced, I was supposed to shoot for Vivek Agnihotri’s Kashmir Files. It is on the exodus of Kashmiri pandits in the ’90s. Hopefully, I can complete the film before I head back (to the US).

How have you used the time during lockdown?

I made videos, I have conducted online classes, I saw web series, I read books, I spoke to friends I have not spoken to in a long time. I have stayed positive.",culture
Uniting for the cause of fashion," What results from the coming together of two sartorial stalwarts on the same screen for a select set of people to pick their minds is an enriching perspective on the entire gamut of the fashion alphabet. Such was the evening of June 24 as Anamika Khanna and Sandeep Khosla were united, albeit through Zoom, during a session organised by the Calcutta chapter of FICCI Flo and steered by fashion and sustainability activist and former journalist Bandana Tewari, that touched upon all the pressing matters that the multibillion-dollar Indian fashion industry are concerned with. While an agreement on business taking a hit was unanimous, it also was the same when it came to them championing the cause of fashion being touched and felt, and therefore, their subsequent belief in a more scaled-down concept of fashion shows sans the ever-contentious business of front-row seating. The causes of “consent, credit and compensation” for artisans and craftsmen were brought to the fore with great conviction by both the designers whose respective labels are known for their Indian craftsmanship, while also weighing in on the myopia of seasonal fashion, especially in a largely mono-seasonal country like India. Excerpts: Reckoning and Realisations

Anamika Khanna: I started okay because all of us were treating it like this much-needed forced break that we had been promising ourselves forever. But soon enough, this lockdown started feeling like a reckoning and I started questioning life itself. When you watched how the migrant workers were walking back home, there was also this realisation every single day that we have so much to be grateful for. We took everything for granted and when the cyclone came, we did not even have phone lines. That feeling that nothing is permanent is really strong. And with everyone talking about businesses failing and the economy crashing, one can’t help but worry as there is a battalion of people depending on you for their livelihoods. But you can’t just sit and worry because you have to get up and work out of it to be able to take charge. So I have gone through all of these emotions.

Sandeep Khosla: It’s been absolutely crazy for me because Abu (Jani) has been in London through this as he could not come back. This (the lockdown) was all too rushed as there was no time to plan for anything — whether it’s your workers or to even get a hold of your parents. My parents are aged 91 and 85 and they’re in Punjab all alone. It’s been crazy thinking about the way forward for the business as well, though I have been a great believer of the resilience of us Indians always. When you’re supporting 700 people, you don’t know what to do because you don’t know how long this situation will last. I had a panic attack one time and asked my doctor to do something! But I sorted myself out, went for walks and even discovered new people in my building — life went on!

Damage to Business

Anamika: One can’t pinpoint to one thing as across the board, the fashion industry has been hit hard. The demand is obviously not the same as you have stock that you need to sell and you have people that you need to provide for. If you don’t have fashion shows, what happens to the huge number of people who are employed in various capacities in the industry? So it’s not like only the top or the bottom of the ladder that’s been hit. Everyone’s been hit equally and at this point, everyone is just managing or trying to stay afloat. Orders have been cancelled, payments are stuck and you don’t want to pressurise anybody but so many people depend on you — it’s like a cycle and we are all entangled in it and it will take time to detangle this.

Sandeep: We were already going through a recession through 2019 and then just as the market started picking up in 2020, it all came to a complete halt. Our artisans play the biggest role for Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla — it’s all about craft and make-in-India. The way forward for us has been just rethinking and redoing and maybe, it means that we have to do just the finest and the best work for the few of us at one level so that we can give our artisans the work they deserve and keep them going. Fortunately, we just sell from our stores so we don’t have to deal with outside order cancellations. But even we have loads of stock that we were in the middle of.  

Consent, Credit and Compensation for Indian art and craft

Anamika: I have noticed for a while now that fine handiwork is reducing and somewhere, there’s been a deficit of respect for our artisans. And going down the chain, the future generations of artisans are not interested to continue forward as well. So this demise of handicraft was happening slowly anyway and this situation has accelerated this process. It is imperative for us to start respecting ourselves first. We attach more value to anything that is made abroad and don’t do the same with what we have here.
Sandeep: I agree and we also need to be more inclusive to respect our minority communities. Our artisans mostly belong to the minor communities and I have always worried about what will happen to my people! Out of my 700 people, 50 went back home but the others are still with us in Mumbai, which is a feat to achieve by itself.

Indian design, by and large, does not seem to exist abroad though international brands take inspiration from Indian brands constantly. But we don’t have a standing over there. So first and foremost, we need to have respect there and our craft needs to get acknowledged first. Once we start the three Cs here, they will have to acknowledge us and the people who are doing the work for them. It should go as “Made in India” and not “Made in Paris” when the craftsmen are here.

Scaling Down to Include the Truly Committed

Anamika: I agree that fashion shows went out of control and larger-than-life became more important than the collection itself — you were as big as the big show that you did. But the touch-and-feel of fashion and the exhilaration of a fashion show can’t be substituted with seeing it on a screen. I hope it does not go away but I agree that we need to make it simpler — reduce the madness and carbon footprint of such events but still do shows that are relevant. Burberry has already announced that they will do an outdoor show in September 2021 but are also saying that whoever can’t attend it can watch it virtually. We can’t have that madness of flying from city to city and sitting in the front row. I think all of us designers have faced more trouble with the front row than the setting of the show itself! I have received hate mails because of this and it’s been the biggest problem of my life! All of this needs to be curtailed but I don’t think we should completely let go of the beauty of a fashion show and its extraordinary moments.  
Sandeep: People will bounce back and it is about touch-and-feel because craftsmanship has to be seen and admired closely. Of course virtual shows can be held but then the plagiarism market will make much more sales than we can ever make! It should be 50-60 people that you invite for a small fashion show and that’s it.

Repeat Value & Retail

Anamika: I think it has a lot to do with societal pressure and we also indulge them. There are also people who won’t repeat something because it’s there on their Instagram. It’s crazy! Even bridal fashion basically comprises heirloom pieces that should be reworn.  

As for retail, while everyone is talking about going online, I am unable to understand how they will take the human touch out of context. Clicking a button in your pyjamas to buy something is not the same as when you experience the shopping. You can’t buy your wedding outfit like that. I don’t think a mad rush to open lots of stores is needed but I don’t see online fashion substituting brick-and-mortar either. For higher-end products, people still want to connect and don’t want to just buy it online and get done with it.
Sandeep: We don’t do seasonal fashion because there is hardly any season in India! I keep telling all my brides that they have to
re-wear what I make for them and it’s so nice to see people who wear our stuff on repeat.

As for retail, we will have visits by appointment to begin with and have two-three customers at a time. I recently went to Good Earth and there were three customers there but it’s good to know that people are out shopping still and we are waiting to welcome them, but in limited numbers and with great safety. I don’t think you can sell couture online anyway! I have had online queries for consults but they will come and meet you one-on-one once to finalise the order.",culture
"‘Apart from my work, music has helped me survive through this gloomy pandemic’— Rafiath Rashid Mithila"," Bangladeshi actress Rafiath Rashid Mithila’s musical roots go back to her childhood. Trained in Nazrul Geeti, she grew up in a musical environment and later went on to write a number of lyrics for Bangla songs and also sang in different albums. Her recent performance videos from home in Dhaka during lockdown have been widely praised. And now, she is set to cover another song soon! The Telegraph chats with the multi-hyphenate talent...  

Musicians across the world are bringing hope and sending out positive vibes and the message of resilience to drive away the lockdown blues. How important a role did music play in your life in the last three months?

Music has always played a very significant role in my life since my childhood. Listening to music has helped me and my daughter (Ayra) a lot. We have also practised together, recorded a couple of songs on mobile phones and shared on my YouTube channel and Facebook. My daughter covered La Vie En Rose by Edith Piaf and I Have A Dream by Abba. These are just some of our amateur efforts to keep ourselves busy in positivity.

My brother, Maimun, who’s also a musician, has played along with us. Our next project is to cover In A Manner Of Speaking by Nouvelle Vague. My brother Maimun Khan has arranged the music for this one. Apart from my work, music has helped me survive through this gloomy pandemic for the past three-and-a-half months.

You must have heard some inspiring lockdown collaborations and watched videos in the last few months.  Which were your favourites?

I am a big fan of Coldplay. Chris Martin has played for his fans on Instagram, which I enjoyed. Coldplay released a beautiful song with an animated video on Father’s Day, which is my favourite now.
You did a cover of Radiohead’s Creep during the lockdown. Why pick that song?

I love that song... heard it years back and for some reason I could always connect to it. I do feel at times weird and a misfit in a world that always pushes you to prove yourself, hails glamour and a lot about having superficial achievements. I sometimes feel tired of putting up with this world. On the other hand, now we are in a different situation, trying to adapt to the new normal, which also at times makes us feel that we don’t belong here.

And you performed Tumi ebar from home...

The song Tumi ebar is written by Srijit (Mukherji; husband). I love the words and the song. I actually learned to play it on guitar to impress Srijit and recorded it for him! He later uploaded it on Facebook.

Tell us about your roots in music… training in vocals and learning to play the guitar. Initially you had learned to play the chords from singer-songwriter Arnob, your cousin...

I was trained in Nazrul Geeti during my childhood. I grew up in a musical environment. My dad used to play tabla as a hobby, my chacha (dad’s brother) used to play Hawaiian guitar, my cousins were all trained in music. Arnob and I sort of grew up together and I have seen him playing different instruments, starting from keyboard, guitar, esraaj, piano etc. Me and my sisters provided background vocals in his first album. Although I never took  it seriously as a profession, music has always been an integral part of my upbringing. Later I wrote a number of lyrics for Bangla songs and also sang in different albums, title songs of telefilms.... I sang one song named Ogochore for Mostofa Sarwar Farooki’s film Third Person Singular Number. Having said all that, I am not a professional singer. I just sing sometimes out of my love for music.

Arnob and vocalist Sunidhi Nayak recently released the song Jogot jure udar shure. What’s your take on their version and the music they have been making together?

Arnob is a very talented musician and Sunidhi is a brilliant singer. I love their work together. Arnob’s music gives Rabindrasangeet a different dimension.

What have you grown up listening to?

Growing up I have listened to all kinds and genres of music. I have listened to Bangla songs from Rabindrasangeet to Hemanta (Mukhopadhyay), Manna Dey to Azam Khan, Mohiner Ghoraguli, Kabir Suman, Anjan Dutt to the band music of Bangladesh. In fact, I have always been a diehard fan of Bangla band music such as Nagar Baul, LRB, Miles, Warfaze, Artcell, Black and so on since my childhood. The Bangla rock band music scenario was always very rich and vibrant in Bangladesh.

On the other hand, I have also listened to English rock, metal, pop, country all kinds of music, from Metallica, Santana, The Doors, Deep Purple, Guns ‘N’ Roses, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, John Denver, Abba, Pink Floyd, Sting, Coldplay, Dido to Lola Marsh... it’s really a very long list. I have also listened to many Hindi songs growing up and R.D. Burman is my favourite.

And what are you currently listening to?

It really depends on my mood. But in recent years I have been listening to Angus and Julia Stone, Lola Marsh, Ray LaMontagne along with Arnob, Anupam Roy as well as music from talented upcoming artistes in Bangladesh.

Who’s been your biggest influence in music?

Difficult to take one name. At different times and ages, different kinds of musicians came as magicians in my life.

Your birthday is on May 25 while Dylan’s on May 24. That must feel special!

Yes it does. But I feel more elated about being born on the same day as Kazi Nazrul Islam!  May 25 is Nazrul’s birthday as well.

What’s your fave Dylan song?

Blowin’ In The Wind, Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door, and Make You Feel My Love.

Recently you posted that Anjan Dutt has been a fave musician since your teen years. Why was his music so special to you?

I could connect and visualise Anjan Dutt’s music. His songs were like stories to me, introducing characters like Bela Bose, Mala, Mary Ann. Anjanda’s music... his words were simple, yet deep.

Which are your fave songs from Srijit’s films?

Almost all of them. I had watched only two of Srijit’s films before I met him. But later I realised that I have listened to most of the songs from his films. I am an avid listener and I listen to anything that is soothing to my ears. From his recent films, my favourites are: Kichchu chaini ami from Shah Jahan Regency, Je kawta din and Abar phire ele from Dwitiyo Purush.

When are you two meeting again?

As soon as we can! It’s been almost four months since we last saw each other in person.

Art Basel Unites 282 galleries from 35 countries online," Art Basel’s Hong Kong edition, earlier this year, was one of the first international art fairs to take a hit due to the pandemic, which also made it one of the first to go virtual with its Online Viewing Rooms (OVR). Their latest edition of the OVR that concluded on June 26 saw 282 leading galleries from 35 countries taking part to showcase more than 4,000 works.

“The OVR is an initiative that had been in the making for several months. We then decided to bring forward the launch of the first iteration following the cancellation of our Hong Kong show to offer our exhibitors there an alternative platform and opportunity to showcase their planned booth presentations at no cost. The Online Viewing Rooms are a long-term global initiative, with future editions, we hope to see coinciding with Art Basel’s shows throughout the year; they initially were not meant to be standalone platforms,” said Adeline Ooi, director Asia of Art Basel.

The June OVR edition saw leading Indian galleries such as Experimenter, Jhaveri Contemporary and Chemould Prescott Road take part. Experimenter hosted a group exhibition called ‘Cataloging Time’, featuring Bani Abidi, CAMP and Sohrab Hura. “The exhibition marks the shifting fundamentals of politics and society, identity and violence, interpretation of truth — and the moments of slippages in our dystopic world,” said Team Experimenter.

Art Basel widened the scope of this OVR with a robust events programme featuring over 100 live-streamed talks, gallery-led tours, curator tours, as well as digital events staged by galleries from studio tours to performances. “With the two editions presented to date, we have received positive feedback from galleries across all levels of the market about sales and connecting with existing and new contacts. The platform generated serious and qualified leads and connections, as well as strong sales. Overall, it was important for us to provide an alternative platform for the art world to engage and stay connected during these times,” added Ooi.

What it’s been like to be back at work ," Priscilla Corner, beauty pro

When did you first visit your salon after the lockdown eased?

I visited the salon on June 1, a week prior to the official opening date. Ironically, my mother (June Tomkyns) had the initial opening of her Ballygunge salon on June 1 decades ago! It was a moment of deja vu.

What was your first reaction on entering the salon after such a long time?

I entered it with all the excitement and longing I felt on the very first day of my journey there as a stylist, way back, only this time the mental soundtrack playing on loop was “Your safety our mission”.

How did you go about setting it up for the reopening? Must have been a mammoth challenge...

We were told we could open from May 21, but Cyclone Amphan didn’t allow for that, so we used that pre-opening week to daily disinfect the salon. I have become a good wader, wading as I do every day through PPE kits, gloves, masks, shields, disposable bed sheets, cutting capes and colour kits, this in addition to monodose pedicure and manicure sachets and facial kits. Then there are fog machines, digital thermometers, and floor and tool disinfectants — we have an entire room for only our disposables. The B&WSSC (Beauty & Wellness Sector Skill Council) sprung into action and issued standard operational guidelines and certificates, all of which our salon made sure we got certified for and updated with. Vendors of sanitisation products went into fifth gear and almost every conceivable safety precaution device became just a phone call away.
The hardest part of it all has been the loss of income for close to two-and-half months, while the fixed costs remained. This is an industry which provides livelihood to close to 90 lakh people. For the most part, owners may break even, if they are lucky. There is no question of profits for a while yet.

What is it like to cut hair wearing a PPE suit?

I do feel a bit surreal, sometimes it’s almost like an out-of-body experience but on the funny side, it could be because the brain is not getting as much oxygen as it should! Watching the staff gliding around silently in socks, masks and shields does make me feel like the head astronaut on an out-of- space adventure, but sci-fi movies have subliminally prepped us for this scissor-wielding robocop phase. Our staff have been wonderfully adaptive.

We may have become faceless and our smiles maybe hidden behind our three-layered masks, but I am sure the twinkle in our eyes as we welcome our clients back into the salon, shine through those face shields.

How many people are working with you at the moment? What is your full strength?

We have three floors so we have allotted five staff to each floor. This vast space allows us to offer clients exclusivity with some of them thrilled at being able to book an entire floor for them alone or their family members as a small group of three. We have halved the operational stations, which helps in keeping with social distancing norms. Each client, at the time of making an appointment is informed about the measures we are taking and asked to wear masks when entering. Their health history is enquired upon. All my staff members are socked as opposed to wearing shoes. We have morning meetings with staff to reinforce the importance of maintaining guidelines.  

Which are the services which have been most in demand after you have opened?

Haircuts, colours, keratin, manicures, pedicures and waxing have won hands down. Clients, after three months of cloister, want colour back in their lives, in their hair and on their nails and we are giving it to them. Guess what the most in-demand colour is? Flamboyant reds! A perfect contrast to the cooling ubiquitous blue of the PPE arsenal.

Can you describe a typical day in the salon now?

The noisy hyper buzz one normally associates with a salon hasn’t yet set in and the ambience is more peppy robocop than rambunctious. Beneath the quietude of mask-induced low-decibel conversations and contactless shrinking violet interactions, I sense an undercurrent of eagerness to break free of the barriers and connect like we used to.
We at the salon are ready to help you burst forth from the subdued silhouettes of a lockdown into a “Hey, I’ve missed you, let’s meet and greet and let’s look our best while we do that, even it’s only my gorgeous hair and brightly coloured nails that are on display.”

Personally, how have you adapted to the new normal?

I certainly am loving creating a safe and sanitised environment for our clients and staff, one in which they can relax in the knowledge that we will take every measure possible to make them feel secure.... They leave our salon happy. And that’s a good thing! It reveals the potential the new normal has, as a good place to be. Let’s run smart, not scared!
  Rimi Nayak, fashion designer

When did you first visit your atelier after the lockdown eased?

I first visited my atelier after almost two months, in the morning following the catastrophic Amphan Cyclone. My studio is located in Ballygunge and the area was completely flooded, so we had to check in on our stocks and raw materials. Luckily, there was no major damage to my studio and office space.

What was your first reaction on entering the atelier after such a long time?

Come to think of it, I spend more time in my studio than my home, and during the lockdown, I really missed being in my workspace. So it was definitely a jubilant feeling and I felt quite charged up to be back to my “second home” after being months away from it.

Did you have any apprehensions before opening up?

Yes, there were tons of apprehensions before we finally decided to reopen the studio, earlier this month after the lockdown was relaxed. Ensuring the safety of my team members and the clients was my top priority. I had detailed discussions with my friends and colleagues from the design fraternity discussing various possibilities and safety measures that we ought to adhere to, before opening our doors.

We initially got the entire studio sanitised and we cleaned up the space thoroughly as we were reopening after almost two-and-a-half months. This was a rather long process, spread across a week before we could finally resume work. Sanitising all the garments individually was truly a task but it was something that had to be done. I have a small core team of 10 members. Fifty per cent are in attendance at the moment and my team members who work in the graphic and social media department are working from home currently.

What have you started with?

I started with the pending orders that were placed with us just before and during the lockdown period.

What was the idea behind the matching masks?

We are not selling the masks. I personally believe it is an essential item currently and it is not really the time to cash  in on this by putting a designer item price tag to it. I do, however, understand that everyone today needs to wear a mask, so I felt that maybe we can just make it look fashionable by matching it with the outfits. We are calling it the new co-ords in fashion.

Can you describe a typical day in your atelier now?

We are starting work from 8.30 in the morning and the day starts with going through the routine sanitising process. Since I’m working with a 50 per cent reduced manpower, and the work pressure is also considerably less, I am getting more time to indulge in creative exploration and the development process.

Personally, how have you adapted to the new normal?

I am usually quite rigid in terms of adapting to something completely new but this lockdown phase has certainly taught me to adapt to uncertainty rather well. I have learned to embrace the present moment more completely and not get too caught up in the uncertainties of the future. This new normal will teach us a lot of important lessons but only if we are open to receiving it. And finally, I’m choosing to look at these trying times through a positive lens and with a sense of gratitude for all the abundance in my life, because as we all know for certain, “this too shall pass.”
  Prasenjit Biswas, make-up pro

What was your first reaction on entering the shoot site after such a long time?

I was elated to be there. I have been home since March 24 and have not stepped out other than emergencies. The thought of going back to work was in itself exciting. It was wonderful to see old faces, although in a new way (all masked!)

Did you have any apprehensions before going?

Of course. Though we started work, we were not going back to normal, it is the new normal. You can be responsible and take all the necessary precautions. You are, however, not sure whether it is ever enough. Sanitisation, arranging masks, face shield… was a job in itself. Cleaning of brushes too… a regular job for me. The trickiest bit, however, was cleaning products, as you cannot just spray on any sanitiser. You have to be extremely careful so that it doesn’t spoil or damage the products. Arranging the correct ingredients was also tricky as you need the best make-up sanitiser.

What are you doing to ensure that there is no touch? Do you have instructions for the models?

I make sure to use masks and gloves at all times. In case there is more than one model, I do my job one at a time, at one place to maintain social distancing. If I have to take a product twice, I sanitise my hand, not touching with the same brush. I am using maximum disposable brushes.

Personally, how have you adapted to the new normal?

Adapting to the new is what we are capable of by nature. It might be difficult but has to be done to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Personally I am energised and ready with my brush to conquer the new normal. I make it a point to travel by my own car. Before I used to carry one luggage but now I have to carry two more bags… one is for the sanitisation products and another for food and water because now I carry my own food and water. Siddharth Kothari, director, Peter Cat and Mocambo

When was the first time you went back to Peter Cat and Mocambo?

We started with the takeaways and delivery around May 15 and the dine-in, on June 8. For economical reasons, I was operating only one kitchen... only the Mocambo kitchen and I was serving both restaurants from one kitchen. Peter Cat was lying shut till June 8. I have been in and out of the restaurants... visiting... trying to see if everything is okay and ensuring that all precautions are being followed.

Normally, what is the average time you spend at both the restaurants?

There is no fixed time as such. It varies... I try to spend a full working day between the restaurants... eight to 10 hours....

How did that change?

When the lockdown was implemented on March 21... from that time till May 3... in between, in April, I had opened for a few days, but I was very uncomfortable for the safety of my staff and families. I have a couple of apartments also above Mocambo and I told them to stay there... it is a full-fledged kitchen... toilet... everything... but everyone was hesitant... and mid-April, it was so new... people around me were doing delivery and takeaways, but I was very iffy with the whole idea because the whole thing was new. After a couple of days, I said let’s stop.

So, apart from those two-three days, I have been pretty much at home. My parents are elderly. I was thinking what if my exposure leads them to some sort of a complication. As time went by, that little confidence built up. The response has been very positive. Of course, it is nothing compared to what we were, but, by God’s grace, it’s still been comfortable.

What was different?

It is a completely different ball game. There is no doubt about that... we have regular SOPs in place... sanitise your hands and shoes, temperature checks... all my staff are wearing gloves, masks and face shields... the government has mentioned 50 per cent capacity... despite all of that, I have also put in glass partition in both restaurants to give the customers that added feeling of comfort. I also have limited staff.

What are you missing the most?

Well, I have to say, the pleasure of serving so many people! A lot of my staff are migrant workers from Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand... old establishments... the entire Western belt... we have got a lot of boys from there... it’s still a bit of a struggle for us... especially my kitchen staff are migrant guys... without them it’s been very difficult... we are trying to get the entire ball rolling again, but touch wood, we have managed to do so....

Will anything change for you, forever, as far as dining goes?

I think this entire process of sanitisation... that will live with us. I like it. It gives a good feeling and improves the generic hygiene of the place. 
  Rohan Arora, footwear designer

You were among the first ones to open up in Calcutta...

I opened up with a 50 per cent sale on our footwear... on May 21. We were also getting a lot of enquiries during the lockdown. A lot of weddings which were supposed to happen in March and April, got postponed to June.... This is the first time since the inception of the brand (10 years back) that we went on a sale.

This was fresh stock?
Absolutely fresh stock... our summer line. We had a lot of stock and had no idea that there will be a long lockdown.... I’ll be honest... it also made a lot of business sense. All in all, it was a well-balanced decision. We were lucky enough to be the early players because after we opened up and went on sale, every other brand... whoever opened up, went on sale.

When was the first time you went to your store after the lockdown eased?

I was there in April to get it sanitised. Then I went on May 15 to get the entire space sanitised again. On May 18 we started our operations. We decided on the precautions and technology played a huge part. We got a lot of orders on WhatsApp. The trickiest part was removing the carpet. Now we have a vinyl flooring.
I am sensitive on the nose and I can smell the good and the bad. So, the first thing upon entering the store after so many days, was the smell of the shoes and the store... it was orgasmic! I am a very boring person. So, whatever interest I have in my life is my work....  I haven’t asked anyone to leave... we work as a family and I am very emotional about it.

Has production started?

Production has started, but not full-swing... at the moment we are working on orders. We are bleeding and trying to curb down our expenses as much as possible. At the factory, we have about 35-40 people on a normal day. Now we have around four.

What is a normal day at the store like now?

In the pre-Covid days, I wouldn’t get time to have lunch. Now I can eat all day... order from three different places and wait for all of them to come together and then enjoy it! It’s really slow.

And, it’s been a lot of family time for you...

Lots! I have shaved my beard, cut my own hair.... I am working on my website which I thought I would never do.... with the changing times you need one.... these times have taught me to be practical, adjust and how.",culture
"Meet Ayushman 'Bobo' Mitra, the artist"," Since I can remember, Ayushman “Bobo” Mitra has been an artist — whether making films as a videography student at St. Xavier’s College, holding an exhibition of his paintings inspired by the names of all his college friends, acting in indie films, studying fashion in London or now, as he makes clothing inspired by his artistic style for Bobo Calcutta. He absolutely refuses to define the style of his art himself but to the eyes of the onlooker, it is defined by his use of colours aplenty, the recurrent leitmotif of love and the motif of those eyes — big, bold and bewitching.
“As far back as I can remember, I have always been inspired by alpona, Ma Durga and things of beauty such as how the goddess was decking up. I am not religious but I have always been drawn by the eyes of Ma Durga — it’s such a Bengali thing. The fact that she had 10 hands seemed so cool to me as a kid,” explained Bobo when I caught up with him. Chats with him, whether over the phone like in this case or even upon running into him at the most crowded of places, are always peppered with good-humoured banter. This particular one was triggered by his outpour of art during this period of lockdown, one stunning painting after another. It made me realise that in the many, many years of knowing him, I had never spoken to him about his art, which governs his purpose over all else.

“I have my artwork on my hands in the form of these faces with those eyes, tattooed on them and people realise that I have an obsession with eyes, which I do,” Bobo added. His first painting ever was that of goddess Kali when he was around seven and he credits his initiation into art to his grandfather, as he reminisced: “My grandfather, who was a great aesthete himself and who everyone in my family says that I have gone after, always encouraged and allowed me to do what I wanted — even when my alpona was bad, he still allowed me to draw it. And that first bold painting of a naked, angry goddess made by a kid still hangs in my dad’s office.”
Transferring his art on to his clothes was an organic process with a certain amount of happenstance, for instance, when someone at a crowded nightclub during his time as a fashion student in London, would shower him with praise for his artwork. “Most people there at fashion school thought what I was doing was great and that’s when I was like ‘Oh, shit! I must be on to something’. People always liked my art but not everyone can own it so that’s when I thought of making art on fabric as I could design clothes and make art and everyone would know it’s me!” With over 10 paintings during the lockdown, he has used up his stock of papers and acrylic paint at home. “I was done chilling and it was time to be productive. I have very erratic sleeping and eating patters, and sometimes I work on each painting for hours on end. Most of my art is for selfish reasons — to make myself happy. It gives me validation and the confidence to do more in life,” admitted Bobo. His recent body of paintings include Kamala — The Flower Vendor, Tumpa & Jonaki — The Sex Workers, and even one modelled after Sky, his beloved pet dog. Each of his paintings have been inspired by his area of preoccupation at any given time spanning his personal life to the world around, expressed through bold strokes of colours and a mix of his signature motifs of ‘bloom’ and the eye.
In the past, Bobo has often also expressed his view on important issues with his artwork on social media and always made a case for beauty and love through paintings featuring kissing faces, flora and fauna aplenty and more recently, through Bagh Begum, a life-size installation for The India Story in December, that he referred to as “citizen Bagh” while chatting with me back then. He continues using traditional Indian design elements in his works such as paraphernalia for a puja, a parrot or the colour red from the quintessential laal paar saada sari. But they all fit into the contemporary, just like when he effortlessly transfers the aforementioned designs on to a pair of Levi’s denims or a fitted corset with a sweetheart neckline. At some point, his dida joined in the conversation and added in Bengali: “He has always made art and I can’t think of a time when he didn’t, which is just like his grandfather too. He is a storyteller and that in itself is art — it’s like his thing.”
Though, to most, he is better known as the designer of artsy clothes that have been worn by names such as Deepika Padukone, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Jim Sarbh and Radhika Apte, he is a man of art foremost, irrespective of the medium. And for the naysayers who dissuade, he cites the example of the Japanese-bred, America-based artist Yayoi Kusama, who is regarded as one of the most important artists of New York’s avant-garde art scene of the ’50s and who now voluntarily resides in a mental health hospital — “She keeps repeating herself to death with her art but that’s what she does and she got science into art, way before installations were installations. Look her up, you’ll go mental!”",culture
Sau saal baad," Leaving aside tragedies and toxicity, wistful “If only Covid-19 had not happened” stories continue to roll out.
For instance, if the un-ordered import from China had not hit the world, June 16, 2020, would have been celebratory — to remember Banglar gaurab Hemant Kumar on his birth centenary. His son Jayanto, alias Babu, had been asked to bring Asha Bhosle to Calcutta for a grand celebration.
In Mumbai, 14A Road in Khar would’ve been named Hemant Kumar Chowk on June 16 — the road where Hemantda bought a bungalow that stood on a 5,670- sqft plot, for Rs 28,000 in 1958. “It sounds like a fairy tale but I still have that agreement with me,” said Babu. Hemantda built his ode to Tagore by naming his iconic bungalow Gitanjali.
It’s in Gitanjali that his wife, Bela, stowed away huge tins of Dalda, a lid welded on each with a slit. Her version of a piggy bank.
Hemanta Mukherjee had left Calcutta and moved to Bombay to score music for the patriotic film, Anand Math, in 1952 — his first Hindi film for producer Sasadhar Mukherjee of Filmalaya Studios. Based on Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s Bengali novel Anandamath, the film was a big flop. But when a commemorative stamp of the Big Four — Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh and Hemant Kumar — was issued in 2003, the compere remembered, “60-65 tunes have been composed on Vande Matram but the Vande Matram composed by Hemantda for Anand Math is still the most popular.” Hemant Kumar’s Vande Matram, sung by Lata Mangeshkar, the marching song when soldiers go to war, is rated among the world’s Top 10 songs of all time.

His second film, Shart, too died at the box office but what lived on were Na ye chand hoga, na tare rahenge and Dekho woh chand chupke, the numbers he composed and sang with Geeta Dutt and Lata Mangeshkar, respectively.
After two flops, a dejected Hemantda had packed his bags and reached Victoria Terminus (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus) station to catch the train back to Calcutta, confident that he was still in demand back home. But unknown to him, wife Bela had quietly dialled Sasadhar Mukherjee from a public phone at the station to apprise him of his intent.
“He told my mother not to tell my dad about the call and he reached VT, caught my dad by the collar and demanded, ‘Where do you think you’re going?’ He told dad that he’d be free to go where he pleased only after a hit film,” recalled Babu.
The proverbial third time lucky was Nagin, a Pradeep Kumar-Vyjayanthimala super hit.
“The first two weeks, there were only flies and mosquitoes at Lido. I still remember it because I got scared of the snakes in the film and dad had to come out of the theatre with me,” chuckled Babu. But once the sound of the “been” caught on like a forest fire, Nagin was unstoppable. Can anybody forget Mann dole mera tan dole even today?
Despite Nagin, Hemantda found little work coming his way. And Bela’s Dalda tins came out.
“Dad decided to make one film and go back to Calcutta.”
When Bela’s Dalda tins were cracked open, there was an astounding Rs 1,75,000 in it — enough to make Bees Saal Baad, the blockbuster in 1961.
Interestingly, that was the time Lata Mangeshkar had given up singing, convinced that she had lost her voice. Hemantda had marched into her house, told her that this was his film, a recording had been fixed at Film Centre and if she fetched up, they would record with her. If she didn’t, she didn’t have to sweat over it, they’d just wait and go home.
Lata Mangeshkar turned up and, in two quick takes, the haunting chartbuster Kahin deep jale kahin dil was recorded. Lata won a Filmfare trophy for it and it marked her comeback as the queen of the recording rooms.
A book with all this and more is on the anvil.
Hemant Kumar’s Bhowanipore house in Calcutta, which played host to Lata, Asha and Geeta, does not exist anymore.
He succumbed to a cardiac arrest in 1989 but his memories and melodies live forever.  ",culture
Mystery of the missing link," Exactly a week before the nationwide lockdown was announced, I received a message from the postmaster of the neighbourhood post office where I have a savings account. He had told my agent that I would have to be physically present in order to transfer an about-to-mature national savings certificate (NSC) fund to my savings account. I could think of no reason why the agent couldn’t fill in for me, but anyone who knows the system will tell you that the post office is a different world order and if you are going to question its ways, you’d better be prepared to wait out the answer.
In any case, with the coronavirus spreading and a child at home, I didn’t feel like walking into the post office. The image of the quaint post office, off the main road, flashed in my mind — a faded, dilapidated, single-storey building, a tree growing out of one of its many crevices, the small veranda where no more than four people could stand, but where always a dozen people were jostling. This is almost the same for most of the post offices in the city. A friend later narrated how a day before the lockdown, her mother announced “like a warrior” that she had to go to the post office for some transaction or the other. She desisted eventually, after much coaxing. Said my friend of her para post office: “It is housed on the first floor of a rickety building, involves a steep climb and a skeleton of a railing for support. Below is the local market. The date on the building is 1924.”

My association with the post office is from the time when I was in high school. My parents swore by post office saving schemes. It is also a fact that in the 1990s there were not too many options.
My father’s attachment to post office savings continued even after his retirement. Every Saturday by 9.30 in the morning, he would be ready to head out to the post office with his handwritten withdrawal slip for his monthly income scheme or MIS. He would brave the queue and be back home slightly after noon. And this, when the local post office was only a stone’s throw away from our house.
For NSC and other savings schemes, he had to do more legwork. First, he had to deposit the certificates in the post office. Thereafter, every week, he had to do the rounds of the post office to enquire if the cheque had arrived. And that was not the end of it. More often than not, the name on the cheque would be misspelt, which meant, another three weeks of wait. Eventually, the banks devised a workaround and he could submit a declaration form along with a photo identity proof at any public sector bank to encash the cheque.
To date, post offices remain the preferred resort for many state government employees. It is from here that they withdraw their pensions. Senior citizens depend on it, as the rate of interest for post office small savings schemes is always a little higher than that offered by banks.
Not long before my father died, Prime Minister Narendra Modi floated Digital Bharat. One day, my father returned home quite late into the afternoon and without money too. “Link failure. What does that mean?” he asked me.
Those who still make rounds of the post office will know what I am talking about. Link failure remains a perennial condition with our post offices. During the first phase of unlockdown, another friend went to the post office to collect the pension on behalf of his mother. He returned empty-handed. At the entrance of the post office was a notice that read — “Link failure”.
After my father’s death, when I started operating the post office account myself, I considered shifting all the money to some bank or the other. My husband urged me to consider shares, but I am very sceptical of the share market.
Like my father, I am old-school when it comes to savings, and small saving schemes of the post office seem safer and more attractive to me. So, when my agent told me that the post office was offering an ATM card, I was relieved. The only glitch — my old account was not “ATM enabled”, hence I had to open a new account. But when I got the documents for my new account, I got everything except the ATM card. “We have run out of ATM cards,” the postmaster announced. It has been three years since then; I am yet to get my ATM card.
The last time when I nudged my agent for it, she said, “It is good that you have not got one. This post office has very few ATM counters. And the ones that have them, hardly ever have any money.”",culture
"John Tenniel’s adventures in Wonderland, Punch and beyond"," Best known today as the illustrator for Lewis Carroll’s Alice books, few know Sir John Tenniel as one of the Victorian era’s chief political cartoonists, who lampooned the police during the ‘Jack the Ripper’ murders. Fewer still, know that the artist worked with one eye for most of his life. Here is a glimpse of the English graphic humorist and illustrator, whose love for high art and artful adaptations of everyday life succeeded in mythologizing the world for generations of art lovers. A blind eye
Tenniel was blind in one eye, but he also had a photographic memory that saw him through.
While practicing fencing with his father in 1840, a dancer and a fencing instructor, Tenniel received a serious eye wound from his father’s rapier, which was missing its protective tip.  Although Tenniel gradually lost sight in his right eye, he never told his father of the severity of the wound, lest he disappoint his old man further. The partial loss of sight was no detriment, and Tenniel continued along his path as an artist, and eventually became a beacon in the late nineteenth century world of illustration. Packing a Punch
Punch, also called The London Charivari, was a British magazine of humor and satire. The weekly, which was most influential in the mid-nineteenth century, also helped to coin the term ‘cartoon’ in its modern sense. The new title was an ironical reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of the Westminster politicians. The London magazine accepted some of Tenniel’s cartoons. 
One in particular was his response to the papal aggression in the 1850s. It showed then prime minister Lord John Russell as David, his sword of truth attacking Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, the Philistine “Goliath”, and commander of an army of Catholic bishops and archbishops. The caricature so upset Richard Doyle, designer of the famous Punch cover that was used for over a century, that he left the magazine. Tenniel was given his position. High art to humorous parts
At first, Tenniel was reluctant to take the position at Punch, arguing that he was more concerned with ‘high art’, or aesthetically pleasing works on literature, music, performing and visual arts. He also doubted his ability to produce humourous cartoons, and according to Spartacus Educational, had asked a friend “Do they suppose there is anything funny about me?” He replaced Doyle as a staff cartoonist in1850. Following this, he was offered his friend Leech’s position as a political cartoonist in 1861, but he continued to maintain a sense of decorum and restraint in the heated socio- political issues of the day.
Tenniel was a Tory, and his cartoons would often upset radicals on the staff. He denied being politically prejudiced, saying “If I have my own little politics, I keep them to myself, and profess only those of the paper.” Comforting and inspiring words for journalists of today. Tracing Jack
Blind Man’s Buff was a famous work by Tenniel, and a mockery of the ineptitude of the Metropolitan Police, who seemed to be failing at the detection of crime. The illustration is one of several that he produced at the onset of what would be known as the famous Whitechapel Murders that took place between 1888 and 1891, where eleven women were gruesomely knifed to death in East London, according to the British Library.
The illustration accompanies an eerie poem, a fragment of which goes:
Lurking crime
Haunts from of old these dens of darksome slime.
There, where well-armed authority fears to tread,
Murder and outrage rear audacious head,
Unscanned, untracked. Five days after this illustration was published, London’s Central News Agency received a letter signed ‘Jack’, from someone claiming to be responsible for the horrific events, someone whose identity was never discovered, and who came to be known as ‘Jack the Ripper’.
The September 29th edition of Punch featured Tenniel’s famous Ripper cartoon The Nemesis of Neglect, showing the artist’s great skill as a draughtsman, or a technical artist. The third and final cartoon was called Whitechapel 1888, and was the only one of the three to refer specifically to the site of the murders. Three days later, the police received another “From Hell” letter. Tenniel and Carroll
Though Tenniel’s cartoons made him famous among his contemporaries, it was his illustrations for Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland that truly made him a household name, Illustrationhistory.org describes. The two were introduced to one another in 1864. After reading the manuscript, Tenniel had made forty two draft illustrations, out of which Carroll, a very particular person who took pride in his own artistic accomplishments, liked only one- the drawing of Humpty Dumpty. The fallout of Tenniel and Carroll’s conflicted relationship arose from their identical tendency towards perfection. Tenniel never accepted another illustration work after Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There. He did, however continue working on cartoons at Punch. Tenniel went so far as to warn Harry Furniss, who would work with Carroll on Sylvie and Bruno. Susan E. Meyer, in A Treasury of the Great Children’s Book Illustrators quotes Tenniel as saying “(Lewis Carroll) is impossible...I’ll give you a week, old chap; you will never put up with that fellow a day longer.” Still life
Tenniel’s artistic methods carried one distinctive characteristic – he would never draw from life. Illustrationhistoy.org mentions how this detail set him far apart from his contemporaries, the Pre-Raphaelites, “who believed that studying and drawing from nature was the only way to produce truthful art”. Tenniel worked best when he referred to the techniques and images in his visual memory and drew without observation.
Susan E. Meyer quotes Carroll as saying “Mr. Tenniel is the only artist who has drawn for me who resolutely refused to use a model and declared he no more needed one than I should need a multiplication table to work a mathematical problem.” As a man, Tenniel was known to be quiet and introverted, content to live without the limelight, and seemingly unaffected by competition or change.
Although flattered by the fame brought along by Carroll’s Alice books, Tenniel viewed the work he did on these classics as a disruption to his routine. He returned to a quiet life at home, and continued to paint watercolours until he went completely blind. ",culture

She plays the saxophone, a huge brass one with an elegant sepia finish, and often, moves over to the wings, dancing to the riffs her co-musicians bounce off each other. The Nubya Garcia quartet has just stunned everyone into silence with her first tune, Static, on a Sunday at Calcutta’s Tollygunge Club, its first stop in a tour organised by British Council that’s celebrating 70 years in India. Playing it for the first time for an audience — “global premiere” she smiles — Static is explosive in the way the 26-year-old hits some high notes on the sax that pierce through a shield of booming bass, intricate keys and percussive drums.
Garcia’s music is jazz all right, but a different kind of jazz, the kind that eggs you on to the dance floor, the kind that contemporary London seems to have been nurturing, so much so that big-time DJs and independent record producers who travel the world scouring new sounds are being hit with curious queries about “the British invasion”.
“We grew up in an era where jazz is not the only music that we love, listen to and play. When you hear so many things you don’t just choose one of them. You kind of emulate,” she tells me enthusiastically after the performance, explaining why diverse cultural strains show up in her music. It helps she is from Camden, northwest London, a counter culture hub known for its grungy flea market and funky clothing. From Afro-Caribbean rhythms to hip-hop and neo-soul, Garcia is part of a London scene that is liberating jazz for a wider audience and loving it. This “new” music is played at night clubs and concert halls. Together with the likes of Moses Boyd (26, drummer), Shabaka Hutchings (33, sax, clarinet), Sheila Maurice-Grey (27, trumpet) and Yazmin Lacey (29, singer-songwriter), they have, The Guardian reports, knocked off the snooty from jazz as we know it.
The mix is evident by the time Garcia and her bandmates — Dominic Canning (keys), Michael Shrimpling (bass) and Jake Long (drums) — are on the second tune. Fly Free is this spacious canvass on which Garcia lines in a beautiful tune. It is gentle and sophisticated, the bass notes setting up a mystical background she feels the need to address by playing them herself on the sax while closing.
“I wrote Fly Free in January 2017. I am really into the 6-8 modal figures in the kind of music I listened to when I was young. So, I really wanted to experiment on modal beats,” she says about a style that is characterised by fewer chords and extended spaces for an improvising instrumentalist to fill in inventively (So What in Miles Davis’s A Kind of Blue is a stellar example). Not surprising that her list of influences would pretty much fill up that little black book of all jazz aficionados.

“John Coltrane is a huge influence. And Miles Davis, obviously. And then Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley,” the 2016 graduate from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance continues. But her eyes light up talking about Dexter Gordon, the American tenor saxophonist who had a penchant for playing his notes ever so slightly behind the beat and who was himself an influence on Coltrane. “Dexter Gordon was the first sax player that I really, really got into.
I was 12 or 13 when I started listening to him.”
Garcia’s first album with six tracks called 5ive released on vinyl and CD, was re-issued thrice. Her next, When We Are, is a success too, having already been re-pressed once. Earlier this year, while playing at a music festival in Texas, there was a long queue of admirers, waiting to buy her EP immediately after her performance. But she was carrying only a handful with her. “Yes, that was amazing. I am still surprised,” she notes with relish. With so much happening in the UK, are jazz musicians making enough in today’s world of YouTube and livestreams? Garcia is upbeat. She believes it is better than the past specifically for jazz as there are more venues open to hosting jazz nights. “We are not rock stars and it still isn’t as good as a salary, but you do get to see the world and meet people if you are lucky. In that respect its very enriching. I wouldn’t say it makes you rich, but you can get by.”
The key of course is originality. “It’s about creating something that’s true to you; not end up copying something that is doing well. It’s what you want to do, what you want to create, who do you want to play with. It’s individual and that’s what makes it special,” she outlines her philosophy before winding up.
On our way out, I ask Garcia about Coltrane’s Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album that’s surfaced now, 55 years after it was recorded. “Yes, I got it immediately. It’s incredible that they found it. I really like it. The amazing thing (about Coltrane), is he’s still giving us joy so many years later.”
Hours later, a tweet from Jazz at Lincoln Centre: “Happy birthday to a creative genius and titan of jazz: #JohnColtrane”. The Tolly Club gig was on September 23. We were discussing Coltrane but did not realise it was his 92nd birth anniversary. That’s joy. Pure fly-free joy. No wonder she’s going places. Garcia recently played at a do headlined by Erykah Badu, the American singer-songwriter-activist whose music I was reminded of while hearing her set — “that’s wonderful because she is a huge influence too” — and at the popular Love Supreme festival at Glynde Place in East Sussex alongside the great dame of soul Mavis Staples.
When We Are has traces of gospel, neo-soul and electronics, something she learnt from Sam Shepherd, the English electronic musician/producer who works under the title Floating Points. These London scene musicians will stop at nothing. The reach of their music seems endless. If jazz is about breaking fresh ground, it’s as though these guys have uprooted the picket fence around their homes, opening themselves up to anything and everything.
“It’s like five people tell you five different stories and then you go and tell another story, and you’ve got elements of all of those bits; and make it one big story. We were just fortunate to have grown up in an age when traditional jazz is still a big part of our lives. But we also go out to hip-hop gigs, raves, garage nights. We’re a product of this vast array of influences,” Garcia sums it up definitively.
For her, watching performances is a catalyst. “Often when you see a gig and it’s like, ‘ah, I want to go and write something now’. Sometimes it’s a tune or a groove in my head that I go on to produce by working out a bass line, the chords and so on.”
There are several facets to this creativity, channelled through various outfits. For instance, the one she is touring with in India (Bhubaneswar, Odisha; Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, for Ziro Festival of Music) isn’t her own band. Only drummer Jake and she have worked together as a part of another band, the spiritual jazz-inspired Maisha, for which they’ve spent hours playing as a duo and then fleshing out melodies and subsequently full-on compositions.

Grandmaster country? 2018 has been a boom year for Indian chess," Dropouts
Though Indians are reigning at the junior level, the same cannot be said for the senior level. The Indian chess community has a problem of dropouts. Guttula says top junior Indian players take a break from the game around age 20 because it doesn’t have any career prospects.
Akash Thakur, Nagpur-based chess coach, agrees that most players drop out because of career pressure. “Players want a secure future. With the immense competition in this field, they are right in their view,” he says.

Anand told The Telegraph that he if he had had a lean patch around the time of a critical academic exam, he may have given up too. “I was very fortunate in my career that just before my 10th standard exams or before I chose my subjects, I became the national champion. I finished my Plus II exams and I became world junior champion and grandmaster. When I finished my BCom, I was number five in the world,” he said.
India is unlikely to challenge the traditional domination of Russia and Europe unless more young grandmasters think it worthwhile to stick on. “We need to work on the mindset and guide our top junior players so they feel highly positive and motivated about making a full-fledged career in chess,” says Guttula. He believes that not just coaches but parents have a pivotal role to play for this change to come about.
Coach Thakur adds another solution. “Maybe, if the Government intervenes and encourages the game, things will soon look up,” he says.  We need some real competition
India’s digital edge has helped with our chess proficiency. Players are exposed to styles all over the world. “A player’s IQ level, quick reflexes, fast decision-making and control over nerves improve with online practice,” says Grand Master Himanshu Sharma.
But this can only be a supplement. A live game bring into play nerves, tension, the ego and the psychological tangle between two players. Ramesh says, “If a player’s work ethic consists of only playing online, then it probably won’t help much.” Our players need the exposure of real tournaments.
In open tournaments, players of any age and level can participate by paying the stipulated entry fee. But it is the closed tournaments, which attract the top players, where we need some more activity. As they are expensive and chess is not yet a spectator sport, India doesn’t host them. And it is in these closed events that are best can meet and compete with the world’s best.
Ramesh says, “We need more tournaments focusing on the very strong players in India which will give our players a chance to play with very strong international players.” Guttula agrees that we need super grandmaster events. “A Super GM tournament needs sponsorship. We have never got such kind of a financial backing so far to invite the top players from the world to play in India.”
There’s some good news on that count now. India hosted its first Super GM tournament from November 9 to 14, 2018, in Kolkata. The Tata Group came forward to sponsor it and it's likely to continue. Here’s to an opening gambit that pays off.  It’s hard to say that 2018 has been a good year, unless you’re talking about Indian chess. We now have 58 grandmasters – the highest title Chess players can get – and rank 8th in the world for our count. In June, R Praggnanandhaa, from Tamil Nadu, became the world's second-youngest chess grandmaster at the age of 12 years and 10 months. The fourth spot among youngest grandmasters is occupied by Parimarjan Negi, 13 years and 4 months. We have had more new grandmasters in 2018 than in any other past year.
So if you’re looking for a boom – and are coming up disappointed - look at the game of 64 squares. India may well be tipped to have the maximum chess champions in the world in the next decade.  India is believed to be the birthplace of chess, the game called Chaturanga, and Shatranj in Urdu. While there are many reasons to rejoice that we are regaining our stakes in the game, there are also some challenges that have kept India from producing another Anand. 
Young old game
On the bright side, this old game is getting younger. Sagar Shah, International Master in 2014, CEO Chessbase India says, “Parents are introducing their children to chess between the ages of three and four years. We used to have grand masters at 12 but now the game is getting younger each day.”
How then do parents and coaches decide who should join up? “The most essential quality at such a tender age is nothing but a keen liking or love towards chess. The child has to enjoy the company of this beautiful game,” Balaji Guttula, FIDE master and coach of South Mumbai Chess Academy (SMCA) says.
Coach Ramesh supports the idea. “It is possible to learn most difficult concepts at a young age. It is better to start young and achieve as much as possible before school related pressures start,” he says.
Schools also play a key role in identifying young talent and nurturing it. Players get exposure when the institution helps them represent their school in inter-school games at the state as well as national level. It is particularly helpful when they are able to attend international tournaments in countries such as Russia, Greece and England. Principal of Father Agnel School in Navi Mumbai, Father Saturnino Almeida, says, “Our students, accompanied by their coaches and parents, regularly go for invitational tournaments, which gives them a first-hand feel of international competition.”
The result is there for all to see. According to media reports, among the top 100 male juniors (under 21 years) in the world, there are 12 Indians, as of November 2018. We stand second only to Russia, which has 14. Among female juniors, there are 11 Indians while Russia has 21. The Anand effect
It was Vishwanathan Anand who put India on the global map of chess and he’s the one who has kept us there. Anand was the World Champion from 2007 to 2012. This has brought some attention to the sport and inspired many young minds in a country not known for doing its best for sportspeople. “During my career, I have seen how India’s relationship with chess changed. It’s very different now from before,” he said to The Telegraph in an interview.
Anand is excited about the talent the country is showing right now. “Praggnanandhaa (Rameshbabu) and Nihal Sarin are showing outstanding qualities at such young ages,” he told The Telegraph. “But even if you look at the older guys… (Pisharodi) Vidyut is doing very well,” he added.
Anand’s home state Tamil Nadu boasts of 15 grandmasters, the maximum from any state. Now other parts of the country are also generating chess geniuses. A registered player needs to earn three norms (a high level performance) and an Elo rating of 2500 to be a grandmaster. We now have three players with a rating above 2700, says R B Ramesh, who has been the coach for the Indian chess team for 12 years. The Chennai-based founder of Chess Gurukul, which has helped budding chess players since 2008, says, “At the top level, our players have been consistently increasing rating points. We now have three players above 2700 rating compared to only one (Anand) a few years ago. It’s definitely an encouraging sign.”",culture
"Crime, punishment and the Grimm brothers"," Once upon a time, there were two brothers whose family fell into hardship after their father died suddenly, leaving them utterly penniless. So it was determined that they would go out into the world to seek their fortune. And although they found their way to a university to study law, not being sons of nobility, they did not receive stipends or aid. This may not have seemed like a good thing then, but it pushed the brothers to work as librarians, researching and collecting tales of simpler times. And the lores and legends that the brothers put together have been happily lapped up by readers ever after. Thus ends the tale of the Brothers Grimm — Jakob and Wilhelm — who gave the world one of its most enduring collection of ‘fairy tales’ 206 years ago yesterday.
Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Children’s and Household Tales), as the brothers called the collection, was inspired by their professor, Karl von Savigny, who taught them that the “spirit of law” — a society’s shared conception of law and justice — defied codification in legal volumes and was instead reflected in a culture’s rituals and tales; these he termed the “living law”. Unthinkable as it may seem, a close look at the Grimms’ tales will throw up indisputable links between the childish world of fantasy stories and the sophisticated study of law.
The aim of the brothers when penning, revising and rewriting the narratives they collected from various sources — oral and written — was the same as that of the criminal justice system: find the truth, convict the guilty and acquit the innocent. Acquittal came with rewards and conviction brought violent punishment — Cinderella gets a prince, the evil sisters have their eyes pecked out by birds. The Grimms consistently sought to persuade their readers that some kinds of violence are meted out as punishment and are thus just, while others are crimes and, as such, unjust. Is it not part of judicial duty to decree legal violence as a penalty for the extrajudicial violence that is being addressed? Perhaps that is why when the wolf devours Red Riding Hood’s grandmother, he is a criminal, but when the hunter kills the wolf he is a vigilante carrying out justice.
If justice in the Grimms’ world is retributive, its measure is decided by the actions of the offender. Villains lose exactly in the way they had intended to win. Gretel pushes the witch into the very oven that she had planned to bake Hansel in; the false bride in The Goose Girl is stripped naked, put in a barrel studded with nails and dragged to death in the gruesome fashion that she herself had conjured up earlier.
But the tales are also a source of comfort. Like law, they try to sustain the idea that there may be hard times and evil in the world, but justice will prevail in the end. And while there may be no place in the modern world for the Grimms’ primitive vision of justice in which violence is an exemplary spectacle, their tales still captivate readers of all ages, teaching them that misbehaviour begets misery.

Tour to revive Chandernagore's 'intangible' heritage," Some members of a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that is working to secure the history and revive the cultural heritage of Chandernagore are launching a tour to give visitors a feel of the town with a rich past.
“It is not enough to save the built heritage. One needs to nurture the intangible heritage, too,” said Krishna Gupta of Chandernagore Sanskriti, who is part of the team that has launched Tour de Chandernagore.
“On behalf of the NGO, we have identified some areas to work on, like the Phorashdanga taant (loom). We have spoken to some weaver families, who are still fluent in French (Chandernagore was under French rule till 1954), as well as the Crafts Council of India. We are urging them to resume production so we can help them market the dhuti and sari they were famous for. This tour will be a showcase for the work we are doing.”
The town by the Hooghly river, about 45km from Calcutta, is steeped in history. “But with most young residents oblivious to the past, Chandernagore is losing its identity. One way of stemming this tide is to bring tourists in. That way, youngsters will feel enthused to learn about their own town so they can act as professional guides. They will also get exposure by interacting with outsiders, including foreigners,” said Basabi Pal, head of the French department of Chandernagore Government College, who plans to organise heritage workshops for students after classes.
She also points to the knowledge gap that exists in the travel agencies that come calling sporadically with tourist groups. “This tour has qualified people with local connection involved.”

Metro was part of the outfit’s inaugural tour and the itinerary revealed an equal stress on Chandernagore’s link with the freedom movement as on its French past. “Since the town was under French rule, those fighting the British could operate here with relative immunity,” said Parashar Basu, urban planner and architect, who was the general secretary of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta in the 1990s.
The first stop was Prabartak Sangha, founded in 1910 by social reformer Motilal Roy. Pradip Banerjee, secretary of Prabartak Aponalay, the boys’ home run by the trust, provided an insight into the Sangha’s activities.
“Every prominent leader of the day has set foot here — Subhas Chandra Bose, Sarojini Naidu, C.R. Das…. Gandhiji came twice, in 1925 and 1926. The pistol to kill Naren Gossain, who had turned approver and deposed against Sri Aurobindo, Barin Ghosh and others in the Alipore bomb case or the bomb used in the assassination attempt on viceroy Lord Hardinge were all manufactured in the house of the Soms next door.”
Chandernagore lacks a decent place for tourists to stay. “We are in talks with some families who have agreed to offer rooms for homestay,” said Gupta. The company is also exploring possibilities of offering a river cruise.
Rafael Moschellat, a young Frenchman staying in Calcutta, was awestruck by the French inscriptions on plaques on Joraghat and the clock tower. He said the current generation in France had not heard of the town at all. “I only knew Chandernagore to be the surname of French historian Francoise Chandernagore! This is quite a discovery.”",culture
Lost and found amidst the bookshelves," It is easy to get lost inside a library as any avid reader would tell you. But in Idaho, this phrase has been given new meaning. Someone has been hiding anti-Trump literature as well as books on LGBTQ issues, gun control and women’s suffrage, tucking some of them away behind books already lined up on the shelves or cruelly refiling them as fiction instead of non-fiction. Although the line separating fiction and non-fiction is slim in the post-truth world, anyone who frequents a library knows that it can be a rabbit hole if it were not for meticulous cataloguing and omniscient librarians. 
Philistine though the supporter of the American president might be, he is not the first one to have found the perfect hiding spot inside a library. Besides shy bookworms, libraries have hidden many a secret. As if the shelves themselves were not cover enough, the New York Public Library has a secret room which “serves as a workspace to a rotating group of authors... The door is locked at all times, and access is restricted to those who have book contracts, a photocopy of which must accompany requests for a key card.”
Then there are the matters of the heart, of course. Love letters are among the things that librarians routinely discover amidst books, especially unfinished ones secreted inside the pages of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. But there are also matters of the body: Playboy magazines and centre-spreads of The Sun are known to have been discovered inside the pages of returned books, not to mention within the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 
There are also sombre, more critical secrets that have been kept by libraries and their primary residents. Take, for instance, the case of Shabiba, a youth organization fighting against the occupation of the Gaza Strip. One of its leading members, Tawfik Abu Khousa, worked at a lending library, which provided the perfect front to send and receive messages hidden inside books. 
Ironically, books, too, can be secreted within the library. The Vatican’s secret archives have gone down in legends for housing classified books and scriptures dating back thousands of years, including the original acts of the 1633 trial of the astronomer Galileo by the Roman Inquisition. But the proverbial needle in the haystack when it comes to libraries are anonymous books. At one point in the history of literature, anonymous and pseudonymous texts were common, even predominant. There is no universally accepted code when it comes to filing these books. They are often shelved according to genre, category and topic. But even on the rare occasion when these are stored together as a category unto itself, the shelves of anonymous books hide treasures that only the indefatigable can unearth. What they also conceal are dreams and aspirations — say of women who dared to pick up the quill when writing was considered the man’s domain — controversial political arguments, mistakes of the past that authors wish to separate from their present writing and so on.
But never underestimate the power of a tenacious bibliophile who spends more time in a library than outside it. Truth will always emerge and all secrets hidden in the library are thus bound to be discovered. That is a secret that Mr Trump’s supporter does not seem to be privy to. ",culture
At the Still Point was a celebration of dance and the times we live in," At the Still Point, an annual celebration of dance by Artsforward, was an experience so diverse yet intimate, it justified the cause they pursue — that of the giving back to the arts the undivided attention they deserve. What sets this festival apart is not just the curation but the model that it functions upon, that of crowdfunding.
Spearheading this festival is Paramita Saha who firmly believes that as a manager, the most fulfilling of all models is the crowd-sourced platform, for you end up interacting with patrons who are truly invested in the arts. The third chapter of At the Still Point, Strange Times, was held at Experimenter Outpost and TopCat CCU between November 8 and 10 and it played host to two vastly different shows — Diya Naidu’s Strange Intimacies and Satakshi Nandy’s Strange Fruit.
“Both the acts are responding to the changing times, in their own ways. So while there is one artiste who prefers to go inward and find secret, intimate ways to connect with a ‘stranger’, the other artistes talk about the harm that strangers are capable of inflicting upon you. Based on what kind of a person you are and what kind of situation you are in, both these responses are valid but we have to acknowledge that times have changed. That’s what we aim to do — bring out work that is not only edgy but also relevant to the times,” said Paramita. t2 experienced both the shows to tell you what you missed so that you don’t miss it again next year!  Strange Intimacies
Strange Intimacy is an act that began four days prior to the allocated date when I was supposed to meet the artiste for the performance. I say “meet” for it was a show designed on a one-on-one format where the audience and the artiste are the only two people sharing a moment together. I received an email marked to a ‘stranger’ from a ‘stranger’ giving me thought starters that I had to choose from, which would later act as the icebreaker in our interaction with each other. These subjects ranged from something that was bothering me or I was thinking about at this point in my life to my relationship with divinity. The topics itself were so intimate that I immediately knew that my interaction with the artiste — Diya Naidu — was going to be of a different kind.
Armed with an intimate story that I wouldn’t mind discussing with a stranger, I showed up for my date with this performance. I was welcomed with an envelope which had my name on it and led to a room at Experimenter Outpost where I was asked to read the letter while waiting. I did.
The three-pager contained lines that were familiar for anybody who has, even for a moment, spent time wondering about “what would people think”. I could relate because I have been the writer of that letter at some point of time in my life while I have also been the one filling myself with these thoughts, at another.
A song emanated from somewhere in the background, which echoed off the walls of Experimenter while I read and soon I was introduced to Diya who sat across from me and started the conversation. We spoke and we spoke and then we spoke some more. She made me lie down and sat beside me as she, in her meditative voice, led me to relax every inch of my mind and body. We went for a walk outside to better connect with the sights and sounds outside after having done the same within the confines of four walls and through all of this, we continued speaking. I had long left behind the story I had set out to narrate to her and we had moved on to dangerous, unexplored territories of my mind. And that’s exactly what sets Diya Naidu’s Strange Intimacies apart from any such experience I may have been lucky enough to observe before this.
We came back to Experimenter and she asked me to wait alone while she prepped for the final and most important bit of the evening — the performance. She danced, she sang, she traced a connection between the earth, sky, fire, water and my pain and she told me my story back to me, albeit with poetry.
It is only through those moments that one comprehends the universality of our emotions. Human beings, as a race, have emotions that are as similar as they are unique and isn’t life about finding the commonalities while celebrating the uniqueness? We are, after all, strangers just as well as we know each other. I came back feeling lighter, armed with these thoughts and memory of a performance I wouldn’t forget anytime soon.  Strange Fruit
Strange Fruit is a dance theatre act that was born in Calcutta and has grown to be a 25-member outfit that tells the story of the oppressor and the oppressed through movements that seem as rhythmic as they are chaotic. Conceptualised by Satakshi Nandy, this act was performed to live music at TopCat CCU. The three-member ensemble comprised Satakshi, Sabita Kashyap and Priyamm Bose, while there was Agnitray Chakraborty on percussions and Dibyokamal Mitra who did a stellar job in contributing to the eerie ambience with their sound. “Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable”, it is often said and that is exactly what this act did to highlight topics like rape, oppression of the minorities and other waywardness that afflict our current society. Power-packed in places and lacking in tempo in places, it managed to create the right air of suspense and disbelief that should grip the audience that is invested in the show. The music was stellar with beats that often highlighted the confusion that affects everyone around us. “What you see now is an evolved version of the solo performance that I had conceptualised back when the Dadri lynching had just occurred in our country. Now, as and when new people have joined the ensemble, the act has moulded itself to adapt to frustrations felt at an individual level by those people,” said Satakshi. Gripping in parts and morbid in some, this too was an experience that definitely deserved to be a part of At the Still Point, Chapter III.",culture
